     Hey everybody, it's Doctor Jo.
},
{
    15.2,19.44
     I got an email from Barry and he was having some TMJ pain.
},
{
    19.44,24.72
     TMJ stands for Tempro Mandibular Joint which is your jaw joint right there.
},
{
    24.72,27.44
     And I'm going to show you today just some simple stretches
},
{
    27.44,32.1
     and strengthening exercises to get that TMJ feeling better.
},
{
    32.1,33.22
     So we're just gonna start off,
},
{
    33.22,35.72
     you wanna start off gently with these exercises.
},
{
    35.72,38.56
     You don't wanna push very hard because this joint is small
},
{
    38.56,41.12
     and it can get irritated very quickly.
},
{
    41.12,43.08
     The first one you wanna do is you're gonna use
},
{
    43.08,44.82
     the palm of your hand so you're not pushing
},
{
    44.82,47.88
     with your fingers but you're using just the palm. You're
},
{
    47.88,51.56
     going to put your palm on one side, it doesn't matter because we're going to do
},
{
    51.56,56.68
     both, and you're going to keep your mouth and teeth aligned so the jaw stays in
},
{
    56.68,60.52
     one spot, your teeth stay aligned so they're not going back and forth like
},
{
    60.52,69.78
     that. You're going to keep it nice and still and you're going to push your palm in that way and just hold it in place. A nice little five second push.
},
{
    69.78,74.2
     Good. See how my jaw is actually not moving but I'm just putting gentle
},
{
    74.2,79.44
     pressure on one side. Then after you do that maybe three to five times five
},
{
    79.44,82.56
     seconds apiece then you're going to switch and do the same thing on the
},
{
    82.56,86.12
     other side. So make sure you don't just do one side not the other side because you want to keep it
},
{
    86.12,91.08
     even. The next one really simply you're going to open your mouth just a little
},
{
    91.08,94.68
     bit and put your fingers inside but make sure you don't bite your fingers. You're
},
{
    94.68,100.56
     not biting, you're keeping again your jaw still and you're pushing pressure down
},
{
    100.56,110.96
     this time. So you're going to put your fingers in your mouth on the on your bottom teeth and just push down. See again my jaw is not moving. I'm not
},
{
    110.96,115.88
     stretching it open. I'm keeping in one spot. Again just start off with about five
},
{
    115.88,122.8
     seconds of gentle pushing and do that about five times. The last one is to
},
{
    122.8,126.56
     stretch out the joint back here. You're going to put your
},
{
    126.56,132.16
     palm on your chin and just push straight back. Again, you want to make sure that your teeth
},
{
    132.16,136.4
     are in alignment. If your teeth are over here or over here and you're moving it, you're
},
{
    136.4,147.9
     going to irritate that joint. So just palm on the chin and relax your jaw and push straight back. So those are the exercises to
},
{
    147.9,152.12
     strengthen and stretch out your TMJ joint if you're having some pain in your
},
{
    152.12,156.04
     jaw. Just start off with about five seconds and then build your way up but
},
{
    156.04,159.6
     make sure you're not pushing too hard. These are gentle stretches for that
},
{
    159.6,162.92
     small joint in your jaw. If you have any questions please leave them in the
