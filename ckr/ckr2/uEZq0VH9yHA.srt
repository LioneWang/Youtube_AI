{
    0.0,1.76
     Okay, Craig is at the Freethon line.
},
{
    1.76,4.44
     Now this is the game winning shot.
},
{
    4.44,7.92
     T-shoots, he scores!
},
{
    7.92,11.36
     Guys, if you're an athlete looking to make just as good
},
{
    11.36,13.0
     of a shot as Craig just did,
},
{
    13.0,14.92
     let's do some of the best exercises.
},
{
    14.92,15.8
     I want you to grab a teamie.
},
{
    15.8,16.64
     Let's get started.
},
{
    16.64,27.58
     What is up, pre You Hubbers?
},
{
    27.58,28.58
     Welcome back to the channel.
},
{
    28.58,30.8
     Dr. Lauren Linus with Dr. Craig Lindell.
},
{
    30.8,33.76
     And we have been working on our trash can basketball game.
},
{
    33.76,37.04
     So if you are an athlete, we actually want you to grab a teammate.
},
{
    37.04,40.84
     Okay, we're going to take you through some of the best shoulder exercises for overhead
},
{
    40.84,41.84
     athletes today.
},
{
    41.84,50.04
     Because Craig and I have a trash can basketball game to finish up and we need some more competition don't you think? Sweet. Okay so
},
{
    50.04,52.52
     once you guys grab a teammate we're going to show you some exercises with a
},
{
    52.52,56.2
     teammate and then show you how to do them by yourself too so you get the best of
},
{
    56.2,60.56
     both worlds. Let's get started. So first teammate exercise for this one at home
},
{
    60.56,63.52
     you're gonna start in an all-for-position you're gonna grab a ball or
},
{
    63.52,66.46
     something that's unstable so that you really have to work on
},
{
    66.46,69.76
     getting into that full range of motion, stabilizing through the shoulder.
},
{
    69.76,71.32
     And then I'm going to beat Craig up a little bit.
},
{
    71.32,73.68
     So I'm going to push his hand, right?
},
{
    73.68,74.68
     Push his arm.
},
{
    74.68,78.6
     I can even get down into his shoulders here, into his hips, right?
},
{
    78.6,81.92
     I'm going to make him work, make his shoulder work, make him have to stabilize.
},
{
    81.92,86.12
     And then if you want to make it more tricky, he can straighten that opposite leg.
},
{
    86.12,88.16
     Now he's really working through the core.
},
{
    88.16,89.24
     He's working through the shoulder.
},
{
    89.24,90.28
     He's working through that hip.
},
{
    90.28,91.12
     Same thing.
},
{
    91.12,93.4
     I can beat him up a little bit and he's working.
},
{
    93.4,95.68
     We're warming him up for that basketball game.
},
{
    96.84,98.32
     Good.
},
{
    98.32,99.16
     Nice Craig.
},
{
    99.16,100.34
     Okay, so grab a teammate, try it.
},
{
    100.34,101.44
     How's it feeling?
},
{
    101.44,102.28
     We're working.
},
{
    102.28,103.12
     We're working.
},
{
    103.12,105.0
     Okay, so let's say you don't have a teammate nearby.
},
{
    105.0,108.0
     Craig can also do this.
},
{
    108.0,110.0
     Yep.
},
{
    110.0,113.0
     Here and then he's tossing.
},
{
    113.0,114.0
     Yeah.
},
{
    114.0,115.0
     Good.
},
{
    115.0,118.0
     So again, working on stability through the core, stability through the shoulder, and
},
{
    118.0,119.0
     he can go different speeds, right?
},
{
    119.0,121.0
     So he can go quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
},
{
    121.0,124.0
     He can go slow or too, really getting back into that shoulder.
},
{
    124.0,125.56
     One thing we really want to focus on
},
{
    125.56,127.84
     is that full shoulder motion, so he can play around
},
{
    127.84,129.72
     with a few different speeds there.
},
{
    129.72,130.36
     Nice.
},
{
    130.36,131.28
     OK.
},
{
    131.28,131.78
     Good.
},
{
    131.78,133.52
     Moving right along.
},
{
    133.52,134.84
     OK.
},
{
    134.84,137.72
     Craig and I are going to play a little game of a...
},
{
    137.72,138.22
     Cach.
},
{
    138.22,138.96
     Cach.
},
{
    138.96,139.28
     OK.
},
{
    139.28,141.0
     So let's do non-teamate first.
},
{
    141.0,144.72
     So Craig is going to start, yep, in kind of a tall kneeling
},
{
    144.72,148.6
     position, and then he's going to push into the wall. Great. So here we're working
},
{
    148.6,152.48
     on explosive power, right? He can get crazy too and he can even come up over
},
{
    152.48,158.48
     head and try a few. Again, getting to that full range of motion. Nice. Okay, so this
},
{
    158.48,166.0
     is without a teammate, and then I'm going to be Craig's teammate, so I'm going to have our very trusty Al snag this from me.
},
{
    170.0,172.0
     Okay, and then I'm tossing for Craig.
},
{
    172.0,175.0
     And I'm tossing high. He's got really low arms.
},
{
    175.0,178.0
     So he's coming up and then has really big arms to slow.
},
{
    178.0,181.0
     Up high, make him reach. Good.
},
{
    181.0,187.0
     So if you've got a teammate, snag them out and practice a few of these with you.
},
{
    187.0,195.64
     Good. Nice. Okay. Thanks, Al. What would we do without you? Okay. I know. Okay. Another
},
{
    195.64,201.76
     game of toss. So, teammate, grab your teammate. Okay. Craig's going to toss back towards me.
},
{
    201.76,205.24
     I'm going to toss it high, so he're having to reach, come all the way across.
},
{
    205.24,207.8
     Okay, great exercise here to work on rotation.
},
{
    207.8,210.8
     Rotation is super important for overhead athletes.
},
{
    210.8,213.3
     We wanna make sure you're getting power from the core.
},
{
    213.3,215.8
     Those oblique slings, and to your imposter,
},
{
    215.8,217.68
     your oblique slings, if you don't know about those,
},
{
    217.68,219.28
     we have an awesome YouTube video.
},
{
    219.28,221.16
     Chuck them out, let's do one more, Craig.
},
{
    221.16,222.92
     Show off a little bit, nice.
},
{
    222.92,223.92
     Good, good, good, good.
},
{
    223.92,226.88
     So you can grab a team, try a few of those.
},
{
    226.88,227.72
     Awesome.
},
{
    227.72,230.0
     Okay, band exercises.
},
{
    230.0,230.94
     Let's move right along.
},
{
    230.94,232.26
     Let's do teammate first.
},
{
    235.04,237.32
     So here again, rotation.
},
{
    237.32,239.74
     Really, really important for that overhead athlete.
},
{
    239.74,242.16
     So Craig's pulling back, he's rotating through,
},
{
    242.16,244.36
     he's punching forward with one shoulder.
},
{
    244.36,249.56
     Yep, good. And I love how, notice how he's coming back nice and slow. So again, he's
},
{
    249.56,253.24
     making those slings work, he's working those rotational muscles in a way that
},
{
    253.24,256.44
     sometimes you don't always challenge them when we're out playing sport, but is a
},
{
    256.44,261.76
     really, really good way to train them when we're working on working out and
},
{
    261.76,267.08
     improving strength and motor control with this. Okay, let's say you don't have a teammate.
},
{
    267.08,272.2
     Craig's gonna show us with the best form ever how to do this by yourself.
},
{
    272.2,273.08
     So same idea, right?
},
{
    273.08,276.8
     He's pulling back, he's rotating through that thoracic spine,
},
{
    276.8,280.16
     really working the core, stabilizing through the shoulder.
},
{
    280.16,281.76
     Nice, good.
},
{
    281.76,282.48
     How you feeling, Craig?
},
{
    282.48,283.44
     Ready for basketball?
},
{
    284.56,292.72
     Okay, nice. Let's do one more. Love it. Okay. So Craig and I have, like I said, a trash can basketball
},
{
    292.72,299.44
     game to go finish up because I'm kicking his butt right now. So ball and ball is live. Okay, guys.
},
{
    299.44,303.28
     Try these out. Grab a teammate. Maybe send these to a teammate. That would be awesome. And give him
},
{
    303.28,305.0
     a go before practice. Maybe after a game and let us know what you teammate. That would be awesome, and give him a go before practice,
},
{
    305.0,307.04
     maybe after a game, and let us know what you think.
},
{
    307.04,309.4
     Go ahead, subscribe, comment, hit that bell,
},
{
    309.4,312.4
     get a notification, and we send out more awesome content,
},
{
    312.4,315.88
     more so, get a notification of when I kick Craig's butt.
},
{
    315.88,317.48
     And you're asking basketball, oh!
},
{
    317.48,319.32
     Okay, we'll see you guys next time.
},
{
    320.2,322.08
     Here comes the pitch, base is loaded.
},
{
    323.08,327.0
     Just winding up, here comes the pitch, base is loaded, it's gone!
},
{
    327.0,336.0
     Now this is the game winning shot, he shoots, he doesn't score.
},
