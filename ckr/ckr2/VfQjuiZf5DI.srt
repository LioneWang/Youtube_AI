     Epinephrine is the first line of defense to treat anaphylaxis and the sooner the reaction

     is treated, the less severe it's likely to become.

     People with severe allergies or a history of anaphylaxis should carry an auto-injectable
},
{
    15.52,18.64
     epinephrine with them at all times.
},
{
    18.64,23.2
     Epinephrine typically comes as a single-dose pre-filled automatic injection device, commonly
},
{
    23.2,25.84
     known as an epiPen, to be injected
},
{
    25.84,26.84
     into the thigh.
},
{
    26.84,31.48
     And anytime an EpiPen has been used, make sure 911 has been called.
},
{
    31.48,35.24
     The person must seek immediate medical treatment, even if they feel better.
},
{
    35.24,40.52
     Now to administer an EpiPen, check the label to confirm that the prescription of the auto
},
{
    40.52,43.0
     injector is for this person.
},
{
    43.0,45.76
     Check the expiration date of the autoinjector.
},
{
    45.76,52.2
     If it is expired, do not use it. If the medication is visible, confirm that the liquid is clear
},
{
    52.2,56.76
     and not cloudy. If it is cloudy, do not use it.
},
{
    56.76,62.84
     Remove the safety cap. Grip the EpiPen in your hand with the tip pointing downward.
},
{
    62.84,66.0
     Never put your thumb, fingers, or hand over the tip.
},
{
    66.0,72.5
     Firmly push the tip into the person's outer thigh until the pen clicks. The needle will go through the
},
{
    72.5,77.5
     clothing, so keep the auto-injector firmly pushed against the thigh at a 90 degree angle.
},
{
    77.5,85.38
     Hold it there for 10 seconds. Pull the EpiPen straight out of the leg and make sure not to pull out at an angle
},
{
    85.38,90.24
     as this could cause a lot of pain and bleeding. If blood comes out, the drug
},
{
    90.24,95.24
     also comes out. Rub the area for about 10 seconds just to help circulate the
},
{
    95.24,100.16
     drug within the muscle of the leg. A second epipen may be administered if the
},
{
    100.16,108.64
     symptoms continue or recur. The person will often feel relief from the tightness in the throat fairly quick.
},
{
    108.64,113.08
     It's often normal for the person to experience side effects from the epinephrine.
},
{
    113.08,121.6
     They may include fast or a pounding heart in the chest, shakiness, feelings of anxiety,
},
{
    121.6,125.8
     dizziness, or even a headache.
},
{
    125.8,132.12
     Once an EpiPen has been administered, make sure it's given to the medical professionals.
},
{
    132.12,138.26
     So in conclusion, allergic reactions are never fun to deal with, and they can usually turn

{
    138.26,143.28
     what's supposed to be a fun outing into an enormously scary event.
},
{
    143.28,146.5
     But when you understand how to recognize the signs and symptoms,
},
{
    146.5,148.5
     and then how to treat them,
},
{
    148.5,152.5
     you can feel confident that even if it does happen,
},
{
    152.5,156.0
     you can be there to take care of your friend, your loved one,
},
{
    156.0,157.5
     or even a perfect stranger.
},
