     Hi guys Jason from MrFigio. Today I'm going to show you two simple techniques to get rid of sputum.
},
{
    6.52,9.02
     Before that I will show you the lung anatomy.
},
{
    9.02,16.98
     This is my brother Johnson and he's got two lungs and in the middle let's say this is windpipe called trachea.
},
{
    16.98,26.88
     And it divides into two main stem bronchi and from there a lot of branches called bronchi go across the lungs and
},
{
    26.88,32.28
     then the air eventually will arrive in arveoli where the gas exchange occurs.
},
{
    32.28,37.88
     So if you have flame in the middle of this airway due to cold, flu and even
},
{
    37.88,43.16
     infections like pneumonia and COVID-19 that airway can be blocked and there
},
{
    43.16,45.82
     will be no more gas exchange and due to gravity
},
{
    46.48,49.92
     Sputum can go down into the base of your lungs
},
{
    50.32,54.42
     Where most of the gas exchange occurs that means there will be less
},
{
    54.92,59.56
     Oxygenated blood in your body and your body function can decrease
},
{
    59.72,63.7
     That's why we need to get rid of them even if you have like a simple cold
},
{
    64.24,66.4
     So I will show you how to do that.
},
{
    67.16,73.76
     Firstly, we're going to take five small breaths to get the air all the way down into the base of your lungs.
},
{
    74.44,77.64
     Use 50% of your full breath and breathe in.
},
{
    80.28,88.04
     Hold your breath for five seconds to get the air all the way down into the lower lobes of your lungs
},
{
    89.24,92.74
     And when you breathe out slowly through your mouth
},
{
    97.2,99.2
     And breathe in again
},
{
    112.12,115.6
     Your belly should come forward so that your diaphragm can come down, which means there is enough space for your lungs to expand.
},
{
    115.6,120.84
     After taking five small breaths, we're going to take another five deep breaths.
},
{
    120.84,125.4
     This time one hand on your belly and the other hand on your lower ribs and take a
},
{
    125.4,134.24
     deep breath. Hold your breath for five seconds
},
{
    136.76,140.4
     and breathe out.
},
{
    142.32,157.7
     On the, breathe in.
},
{
    157.7,159.66
     Slowly breathe out.
},
{
    159.66,166.0
     We're doing this to get the air behind the sputum so that it can push the sputum up. Also the air can
},
{
    166.0,172.24
     moisturize the airways and the sticky sputum. The last technique is Huff and Cough and there
},
{
    172.24,177.52
     are two ways of huffing. The first one is take a small breath and breathe out slowly for a few
},
{
    177.52,187.8
     seconds. So take a small breath through belly breathing, hold for a couple of seconds and then breathe out.
},
{
    191.64,206.48
     You have to make all shape with your mouth. Take a small breath and breathe out for a few seconds.
},
{
    209.48,210.0
     You can actually cough if you want,
},
{
    213.32,214.4
     but try this couple of times and then move on to the next huffing technique.
},
{
    215.0,218.24
     The second technique is to take a deep breath and breathe very
},
{
    218.24,220.44
     strongly for just one second.
},
{
    233.6,250.92
     second. Oh, it's coming. So you try this couple of times. I will do one more time. It's in there.
},
{
    250.92,251.92
     Don't swallow it.
},
{
    251.92,258.4
     So you take five small breaths and five deep breaths and a couple of times of, you know,
},
{
    258.4,262.92
     small huffing and bigger huffing a couple of times as well.
},
{
    262.92,269.32
     If you can't get rid of the flam at the end of this cycle, then you have to cough a couple of times as well. If you can't get rid of the flame at the end of this cycle then you have to cough couple of times but if you still have
},
{
    269.32,274.36
     some flame left you have to repeat this whole process again. However too much
},
{
    274.36,279.68
     huff and cough can cause sore throat so just do it maybe you know a couple of
},
{
    279.68,284.24
     times per hour only. And you can try another technique for this you need you
},
{
    284.24,286.4
     know plastic bottle and
},
{
    286.4,290.64
     straw. It's very simple. You just take deep breath and blow it into the water.
},
{
    296.4,299.68
     It's very simple. It's very simple. It's very simple. Okay, one more time.
},
{
    312.56,315.0
     You repeat this 10 to 20 times and finish with half and cough. The rational behind this device is this.
},
{
    315.0,319.36
     When you blow into the water, you can't exhale the air all at once.
},
{
    319.36,322.36
     So the air will stay longer in your airway.
},
{
    322.36,325.72
     Open up the airways and you know, moisturize your airway. Open up the airways and you know moisturize the airway.
},
{
    325.72,331.32
     So today we talked about some simple techniques to get rid of the flam and I've got my pants
},
{
    331.32,334.32
     wet. I'll see you next time.
