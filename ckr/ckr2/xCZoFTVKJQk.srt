     Bob and Brad the two most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    8.82,12.24
     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist, Brad Heineck physical therapist
},
{
    12.24,16.2
     Together we are the most famous physical therapists on the internet, in our opinion of course Bob
},
{
    16.2,22.1
     Brad today you want to talk about the 10 best treatments for golfer's elbow, which is also known as medial epicondylitis or
},
{
    22.56,27.28
     Throwers elbow,, really I know that, this is people throwing a ball,
},
{
    27.28,31.92
     throwing a javelin, you know if you're throwing something overhead you're working these muscles,
},
{
    31.92,37.52
     throwing it away, exactly and actually I'm a golfer and I've never had this thankfully, really,
},
{
    39.52,45.96
     but I can certainly understand how you can get it,, let's get Napoleon over here and talk about what are we talking about in particular?
},
{
    46.2,52.36
     Here we got Napoleon and Gumby and there's a few people out there about that.
},

},
{
    65.36,69.32
     We're giving away something so you know there's a reason to be there so you better believe it
},
{
    69.32,72.34
     Let's go let's look at this so we're looking at golfer's elbow
},
{
    72.34,79.16
     It happens on what we call the medial aspect of the elbow in other words the inside which is right there and we're looking at a bone
},
{
    79.16,86.9
     Which is way over in here, but let's look at it with Napoleon so we can take the muscles away and look at it and here we got a nice piece of duct tape
},
{
    86.9,94.04
     Naturally works well for showing where the location is the bone is right here and the duct tape represents
},
{
    94.04,101.14
     Where the muscles go they all go down through the carpal tunnel and there's a couple responsible for bending the wrist this way
},
{
    101.14,106.68
     And the other ones are for flexing the fingers and a couple go into the forearms to help turn the forearms
},
{
    106.68,110.86
     Exactly, we're not getting real detailed in there, but the bone is right there
},
{
    110.86,115.6
     It's called a medial epicondyle and that's where they connect
},
{
    115.6,120.48
     So you can see when that attaches to it, the muscle becomes tendon and attaches to it
},
{
    120.48,125.48
     It pulls and yanks on that and after time this can get all inflamed and sore and right
},
{
    125.48,129.08
     And instead of being if you look at the tape kind of taped on
},
{
    129.08,133.04
     It's like the tape starts to tear off a little bit and when you push on that where the
},
{
    133.2,139.56
     Where the muscles supposed to be connected and it's not connected as it should be we get tenderness and boy can it get tender
},
{
    139.56,145.14
     People I think are normally shocked how tender it is. Yeah, it's one of those things that makes you say
},
{
    145.14,149.8
     I could make you say bad things, but we don't like that kind of thing. Okay
},
{
    151.34,155.02
     So oftentimes this is a repetitive motion injury
},
{
    155.22,162.38
     Okay, people working in the trades working with screwdrivers cordless drills that type of thing you're really flexing that wrist a lot
},
{
    163.26,168.98
     That repetitive motion day after day week after week swing after swing swing after exactly with the golf
},
{
    168.98,174.86
     Or it can be from that like if you're swinging that golf and all of a sudden you probably never do this Bob
},
{
    174.86,177.42
     But you hit it and a whole yard of dirt goes flying
},
{
    177.42,181.14
     Yeah, I'm front of you. I've been a sod farmer and that abrupt
},
{
    182.32,186.6
     Impact through that muscle can help tear that off the bone a little bit
},
{
    186.6,189.4
     I can see that with baseball too or softball
},
{
    189.4,191.88
     Exactly, you're throwing that
},
{
    192.6,197.56
     Pettitively, so if you got this and you know you'll have it because when you palpate or you push on that bone
},
{
    197.56,201.44
     It's very tender and makes you really open your eyes up
},
{
    201.88,205.68
     First thing you need to do is stop the activity that started it.
},
{
    205.68,211.4
     So if you're a golfer you're gonna need to take some time away from it. Exactly. I know that's
},
{
    211.4,215.92
     very hard for I mean pretty much anybody in any sport. It's really difficult. Right or if it's
},
{
    215.92,220.4
     your work, if it's taken away from your work, you know if you can have modified duty of some sort.
},
{
    220.4,225.48
     One thing that does help, I'm gonna jump to to this right away is you can get an air cast
},
{
    226.16,232.78
     Band there's a number of different manufacturers, but they all work similar like this one has what we call air bladder
},
{
    232.78,237.26
     I'm gonna pull it out. It's just simply an air bladder. Can you see that line? You pretty good?
},
{
    238.06,240.46
     Yeah, okay, it slips right in there
},
{
    242.96,249.74
     And you put that not directly over the source spot, but typically just distal or closer to the hand
},
{
    249.74,258.74
     So the sore spots right here, he puts it right here, that way some of the pressure is being taken right here instead of here
},
{
    258.74,260.74
     And then you tighten it up like that
},
{
    260.74,266.96
     And pretty much universal Brad, people that wear this seem like it does help. It doesn't solve it
},
{
    266.96,270.28
     But it does help. Right, right. You know you can gives you a little more
},
{
    271.28,274.2
     Ability to use it without irritating it so much
},
{
    274.68,277.64
     But it's you still need to go through the other steps as well
},
{
    277.64,284.88
     But they do work reasonably well one of the complaint is if you find out it works and it has to be too close
},
{
    285.64,289.04
     Sometimes when you bend your elbow it kind of gets in the elbow
},
{
    289.56,292.96
     That's one thing you have to kind of deal with just a little warning there
},
{
    293.32,295.16
     Another thing you can do is ice
},
{
    295.16,299.28
     This is not really the size of cup that we use but normally we take like a coffee cup
},
{
    299.28,305.78
     We fill it with water we freeze it then you can actually tear off the top, the tip of the cup and that
},
{
    305.78,311.28
     Exposes the ice, I usually take my palm and warm it up a little bit just to make it smooth
},
{
    311.28,313.78
     Well to make it smooth, I know what you mean by that
},
{
    313.78,317.96
     So then you can go ahead and just go ahead and very quickly then it only takes a couple minutes then to
},
{
    317.96,322.62
     Ice it up and really get it cooled down, right, you can use a gel pack too like this
},
{
    322.62,326.74
     They take a little bit longer, but you can do that and cool it down with that
},
{
    326.74,333.14
     But you know after a hard day, you know it's irritated you got to cool it down one way or another with this or direct ice
},
{
    333.84,338.56
     Direct ice is faster this takes you know 15 minutes or so, but they both are effective
},
{
    338.92,340.92
     So what's next on
},
{
    341.72,346.66
     Usually the massage right? Right exactly and actually I'm gonna there's
},
{
    346.66,351.7
     there's a before we get into the what we really have good luck with it across
},
{
    351.7,356.3
     friction is these muscles sometimes will tighten up. Oh I agree 100% yeah I
},
{
    356.3,360.26
     think you definitely need to massage down in this area. So you get the belly
},
{
    360.26,364.18
     of the muscle and in there you know what I like to do is I like to just take my
},
{
    364.18,365.92
     knuckles and you can just get in
},
{
    365.92,367.92
     There with your knuckles you can do it with your thumb
},
{
    368.18,373.08
     But your thumb will get tired because you want to loosen those tight muscles up and the muscles loosen up
},
{
    373.68,378.3
     Bob you're in my way. I think it's always good to have a pillow on it. That's a good idea
},
{
    378.3,383.8
     It'll show up better. Yeah, how's that Lani? Good idea. They call this like the flexor wad
},
{
    383.8,384.56
     How's that Lani? Good idea. They call this like the flexor wad
},
{
    391.9,394.6
     And working on that without a doubt I think is really helpful and you generally I think find that to be sore too Brad Don't you? Oh, yeah, and you'll find knots in there sometimes
},
{
    394.6,400.5
     It feel like a ropey, sometimes if you can find that ropey knot the rope would be kind of like going this way because it's good as a
},
{
    401.04,406.36
     Preventive thing even. Oh sure. I'm sorry. I was cutting you off. That's all right Bob. I'll let it go this time
},
{
    406.88,410.22
     But yeah, so you can get under your thumb once your thumb gets tired
},
{
    410.22,415.3
     Then it's time to get you with your knuckles because they'll last longer and you want to loosen those muscles up
},
{
    415.3,420.22
     You'll probably do this for five minutes by that time you'll get tired of it. Sure. Get the carpal tunnel on the other one
},
{
    420.22,421.32
     Yeah
},
{
    421.32,423.48
     And then if you want to get into the cross-friction
},
{
    424.56,429.32
     Yeah, and then if you want to get into the cross-friction massage That's gonna get up in that area, right, but if it's really tender and flared up
},
{
    429.32,433.68
     You have to wait for the right time, you got to give it some time might be a few days into it
},
{
    433.68,436.04
     Generally I found Brad you're gonna be a little bit off the bone
},
{
    436.04,439.32
     You're not generally gonna be on the bone itself just a little bit off of it
},
{
    439.32,446.96
     Yeah, and again what has happened is the tendon has either torn or it's got frayed
},
{
    446.96,449.92
     Sure, and you're actually gonna go in there and you're gonna actually
},
{
    450.12,454.6
     It's got scar tissue that's laid down. It's starting to scar in because it's healing itself
},
{
    454.6,457.24
     And then when you use it again the scar tissue breaks open
},
{
    457.28,463.24
     So what we're trying to do is do a massage to make those fibers strong and lined up again, right now
},
{
    463.24,466.82
     They're like a cobweb, right? So we want to
},
{
    466.92,471.78
     To be honest with you Bob, I don't quite fully understand it, but it works, right?
},
{
    472.12,475.98
     These are all theories of how it works, but you're gonna get it right there as a bone
},
{
    475.98,480.96
     You'll feel that the really pointy bone you get into that and then you're gonna get over the sore spot
},
{
    480.96,489.6
     And you're gonna work back and forth the fibers go this way so you're going 90 degree across from it and you're just going to work like this. I'm rubbing hard. I'm getting in
},
{
    489.6,495.44
     deep. If you can zoom in Lonnie to see I've got wrinkles on my skin not from aging process either.
},
{
    496.0,501.76
     He can use also two fingers you can go like that or thumb or finger on top of finger and
},
{
    503.2,505.76
     again you're going to go for I mean you can do this a
},
{
    505.76,510.28
     long time but generally what I do is break it up, you know maybe do three
},
{
    510.28,513.72
     four minutes at a time and then later in the day do another three four minutes
},
{
    513.72,517.12
     and you'll know this is the right thing to do because after the first minute it's
},
{
    517.12,521.96
     gonna start to feel better, if it starts hurting worse you need to give it a
},
{
    521.96,527.2
     break, give it a day or two and get some ice on it it It should start to numb up or feel better or like a Brad said
},
{
    527.2,531.88
     Not numb from the ice but actually kind of feels nummish from the rubbing, right?
},
{
    531.88,533.56
     It's that sensation
},
{
    533.56,538.88
     So and once you get to that phase and it starts to feel better that is time to start strengthening it
},
{
    539.08,544.92
     So did you want to do stretches to Brad? Oh, yeah, that's right stretching
},
{
    548.76,551.8
     So the muscles come here, so we're gonna stretch it going this direction I'm gonna show you a couple stretches you can go like this
},
{
    551.92,555.72
     That's fairly aggressive if you keep your elbow bent it won't be as aggressive
},
{
    556.24,558.0
     Definitely more aggressive
},
{
    558.0,562.6
     Now remember you're stretching it just to gently stretch it not to re-tear it
},
{
    562.6,565.84
     So don't get real aggressive because you might just go back to where you were
},
{
    565.84,569.38
     So gentle stretches you're only gonna hold them for you know 10 or 15
},
{
    569.38,572.78
     Don't bump up against the pain basically don't go into the pain
},
{
    572.78,575.72
     You can go pressure on pressure off pressure on
},
{
    576.28,582.16
     Some people like to do the long 30 second stretch. I'm not a big fan of it personally, but that's just me
},
{
    582.6,585.48
     So you got to listen to your body, you can do some weight-bearing
},
{
    585.8,592.92
     stretches like this on a low table and lean into it and if you start rotating your hands out this way it'll get a little more
},
{
    592.92,597.84
     aggressive and if you're young enough or agile enough to do this is really aggressive.
},
{
    598.2,604.66
     But that's near the end of it. So you're just gonna work it gently, a gentle stretch not too aggressive,
},
{
    605.04,607.64
     15 to 30 seconds or pressure on pressure off
},
{
    607.64,610.86
     That one you can wrap fairly soon, I think if you can tolerate it
},
{
    610.86,613.28
     Right, it's all depends you know listen to your body
},
{
    613.28,618.48
     Don't be the he-man I think no pain no gain because the pain is just gonna set you back if you get too aggressive
},
{
    618.58,623.2
     So now we're going into strengthening, right now this is one that I really like
},
{
    623.18,625.98
     Right now this is one that I really like
},
{
    627.68,633.12
     Don't worry something but Actually, you know you want to strengthen these muscles in this direction so they're flexing so you want to strengthen them this way
},
{
    633.12,636.18
     But they also get involved with this motion of the ribs
},
{
    636.88,641.24
     So easy way to do that and it's functional is this get a hammer and
},
{
    641.8,644.74
     You can start with the hammer right here, and it's very easy
},
{
    644.74,647.58
     is this get a hammer and you can start with the hammer right here and it's very easy So you want full range of motion supination?
},
{
    647.58,651.48
     He's got a lot of the handle sticking out here is what he's got, if you can see that or not
},
{
    651.48,656.5
     Now as I go out to here and always at the end of the handle, it's much harder, a lot more work
},
{
    656.58,660.44
     Now depending on how strong you are you may have to use a bigger hammer
},
{
    660.44,666.12
     You know this is maybe a 16 ounce, you know if you get a 2 pound ball peen hammer
},
{
    666.12,671.24
     I think originally the old Brad, especially with the problem you had I think that's gonna be enough for a lot of people
},
{
    671.24,676.84
     If you're one of those big burly people and when you're getting stronger, they probably have some
},
{
    676.84,680.28
     2 pound mall in their garage, you can take your golf club, there you go
},
{
    680.28,690.16
     You could do that as well, you can go all the way up and then you can start going down And repetitions of ten repetitions with full range of motion, good slow smooth control
},
{
    690.16,695.2
     And then for the flexion part of it you got a couple options you can use at home
},
{
    695.2,698.2
     You can use the fair band or fair tubing
},
{
    698.2,700.2
     You could do the hammer floor light for light stuff huh?
},
{
    700.2,702.2
     Yeah, what's not much though?
},
{
    702.2,704.2
     Yeah, and it's a pound
},
{
    704.2,706.48
     I would probably get a soup can because it's a little more
},
{
    706.48,709.4
     even or hopefully you have a dumbbell. Sure
},
{
    710.72,712.72
     You know and there's a theory of
},
{
    712.88,716.56
     eccentric starting out with having the weight up here and letting it down slowly
},
{
    717.4,720.84
     Helping it up eccentric seems to promote healing more. Yep
},
{
    721.68,724.8
     The remodeling process as the theory goes
},
{
    727.74,733.8
     more. The remodeling process as the theory goes there and let it down and you can do repetitions of ten of that. Go up and down a normal repetition sets of
},
{
    733.8,738.78
     ten to fifteen. If you got third tubing with these handles these actually work
},
{
    738.78,746.68
     pretty nice. You notice I'm in a lower chair if I'm sitting on a higher chair doesn't work so well because I'm using my forearm
},
{
    747.08,749.44
     On my thigh to give support
},
{
    749.44,753.88
     Yep, and it really works out well and if I want to do the eccentric
},
{
    753.88,756.52
     So I'm gonna help it up with the other hand and let it down slowly
},
{
    757.36,758.68
     Help it up
},
{
    758.68,760.6
     Let it down
