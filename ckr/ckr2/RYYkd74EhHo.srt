     Lastly, if you're having jaw pain due to clenching or grinding your teeth,
},

    121.28,125.6
     always consider wearing a night guard when you sleep and avoid chewing gum and hard foods
},
{
    125.6,127.56
     to cut down on the painful movements of the jaw.
},
{
    127.56,130.44
     Also, a hot compress or ice pack applied to the jaw
},
{
    130.44,132.6
     may provide temporary relief as well.
