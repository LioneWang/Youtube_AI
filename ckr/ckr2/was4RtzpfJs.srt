     Wooo! Hey everybody, it's Doctor Jo and the Pups and today I'm going to show you my 5-minute
},
{
    6.36,11.04
     stretching routine for neck pain in real time. So let's get started. Yeah, Bear, let's get
},
{
    11.04,19.54
     started. Disclaimer alert, disclaimer alert. So with a real time stretching routine, just
},
{
    19.54,28.28
     5 minutes is all you need. I have my patients a lot of times say, I don't have 30 to 45 minutes throughout the day to do my home exercise program. With a
},
{
    28.28,31.72
     home exercise program it's really about the quality of the stretches and
},
{
    31.72,36.36
     exercises not necessarily the quantity. So I say five minutes a couple times
},
{
    36.36,40.24
     throughout the day. It really should be doable, something that you can do. Since
},
{
    40.24,43.6
     these neck pain stretches are in real time, if you'd like to follow along with
},
{
    43.6,48.08
     me you can because I'm gonna do them for the full time that you need to stretch.
},
{
    48.08,53.12
     The way I have it set up on my timer is I'm going to do a 45 second warm-up and then I'm going to
},
{
    53.12,57.92
     do a stretch on each side for 30 seconds. I know if you've seen some of my videos, I always say
},
{
    57.92,66.08
     do the 30 seconds three times on each side but again, I'd rather you get the quality stretch for a short amount of reps versus
},
{
    66.64,71.92
     trying to just get three but not do the full 30 seconds. So we're going to do 30 second stretch
},
{
    71.92,76.56
     on each side, take a little 10 second break in between and then go into the next stretches. So
},
{
    77.2,80.96
     a total, it'll be a little bit more than five minutes but the actual stretches will just be
},
{
    80.96,88.4
     a quick five minutes that you should easily be able to do. So we're gonna start off with the 45 second just warm up in general and
},
{
    88.4,92.16
     with a warm up you don't have to do anything crazy we're just gonna start
},
{
    92.16,96.0
     getting some movement so I'm just gonna start turning my head side to side. You
},
{
    96.0,99.32
     don't really have to hold this because you're just trying to warm up those
},
{
    99.32,104.0
     muscles before you go into the stretches so maybe just five on each side you
},
{
    104.0,106.36
     don't have to be specific with the numbers,
},
{
    106.36,109.06
     but again, just getting the movements a little bit.
},
{
    109.06,112.4
     Then you can kind of go into a side bend.
},
{
    112.4,114.48
     When you're doing the side bend,
},
{
    114.48,116.04
     you wanna bring your ear down.
},
{
    116.04,117.48
     You don't wanna bring your shoulder up.
},
{
    117.48,119.46
     So again, this is just a continuous movement
},
{
    119.46,122.28
     to try and get everything loosened up
},
{
    122.28,123.76
     and ready to go into those stretches.
},
{
    123.76,128.66
     So again, maybe just five on each side, you don't have to really count. Your shoulders are also,
},
{
    128.66,132.36
     those muscles in your shoulders are connected to your neck, so just a couple
},
{
    132.36,136.9
     rolls before you get started. So now we're going to go into the first stretch.
},
{
    136.9,140.38
     So an upper trap stretch is the one I like. I'm going to go ahead and go into
},
{
    140.38,144.62
     the motion and just talk to you about it a little bit. So I'm sitting on my hand
},
{
    144.62,147.8
     and that's just to help hold my shoulder down to get the extra stretch.
},
{
    147.8,150.68
     You don't have to do that but you're gonna get a better stretch if you can
},
{
    150.68,154.88
     keep that shoulder down. And then I'm just bringing my ear over pulling to the
},
{
    154.88,159.2
     opposite side and getting that stretch through that upper trap right there. And
},
{
    159.2,163.24
     so you don't want it to be painful you just want to have that nice stretch. So
},
{
    163.24,168.0
     see 30 seconds goes pretty fast and then we're gonna switch over to the other side. So same
},
{
    168.0,171.92
     thing just sitting on that hand and pulling over. If you don't want to sit
},
{
    171.92,175.48
     on it you can put your hand behind your back like this and you'll still get a
},
{
    175.48,179.52
     good stretch. Just trying to pull that elbow down towards the chair while
},
{
    179.52,182.8
     you're going over and you're gonna get that nice stretch through that upper
},
{
    182.8,187.32
     trap muscle right there. And so that's a big stressor muscle when it's tight it can cause a
},
{
    187.32,191.24
     lot of neck pain and so this is just a good way to kind of get it all nice and
},
{
    191.24,196.0
     stretched out. So after this one we're going to take a quick little 10 second
},
{
    196.0,199.08
     break to kind of reset all those muscles and then we're going to go into a
},
{
    199.08,204.0
     levator scapulae stretch. And so that one's where a lot of our stress comes in
},
{
    204.0,205.04
     when we're working
},
{
    205.04,209.36
     throughout the day. So I'm just going to bring my elbow up like this and then
},
{
    209.36,213.84
     I'm taking my nose towards the opposite knee. So I'm just holding this stretch
},
{
    213.84,218.04
     right here. If your elbow is uncomfortable in this position, you can
},
{
    218.04,223.04
     just bring your arm up for the stretch. And then if both of those are uncomfortable,
},
{
    223.04,229.48
     you can bring it down. But again with my arm up like this I'm pushing that shoulder blade down to get
},
{
    229.48,233.22
     a better stretch. Now make sure that you're turning your nose towards the
},
{
    233.22,237.88
     opposite side there. So now I'm going to switch sides bringing that elbow up
},
{
    237.88,243.22
     that's the one I prefer turning my head and then pulling it down towards that
},
{
    243.22,246.0
     opposite knee. So I'm not bending my head sideways,
},
{
    246.0,253.28
     I'm not looking down and turning it over. I'm rotating it over and pulling behind my head
},
{
    253.28,258.8
     down where my nose is going towards that opposite knee and getting that nice stretch in there.
},
{
    261.12,267.4
     So then once you get this stretch again just take a little 10 second break to kind of reset everything.
},
{
    267.4,274.6
     And then we're going to go into the anterior scaling muscles, which are again a lot of the ones that cause that neck pain.
},
{
    274.6,282.9
     Take your hand and pull down on that collar bone or clavicle and turn that way and then bring your chin up.
},
{
    282.9,288.16
     So you should feel the stretch kind of through here now. That's where those those muscles are and again you don't
},
{
    288.16,292.14
     have to pull down on that collar bone, that clavicle bone, but this will give
},
{
    292.14,296.2
     you an extra stretch. So you can just turn and go up like that but I feel a
},
{
    296.2,301.16
     much better stretch if I just kind of pull down gently that way. And so I have
},
{
    301.16,304.8
     one of my patients say this is this is like a portrait pose. Like you're
},
{
    304.8,309.72
     gazing out into nothingness. So again then pulling down here bringing
},
{
    309.72,314.56
     my chin over and then look pulling my head up that way. So just getting that
},
{
    314.56,321.32
     nice stretch in there again turning and pulling up. So nice good hold there again
},
{
    321.32,328.28
     I'm feeling that kind of through there. The stretch is shouldn't painful, you should just be feeling some tension on there and that's really
},
{
    328.28,335.02
     what you should be feeling. So again after that stretch, take that little 10
},
{
    335.02,339.38
     second break and then shake it out. So the next one's gonna be a chin tuck so
},
{
    339.38,342.48
     it's a little bit different because you're not gonna actually hold for 30
},
{
    342.48,348.44
     seconds. So if you've seen a lot of my stuff, the chin tuck is bringing it back this way. So I'm not
},
{
    348.44,354.0
     tucking in this way. I'm taking my chin and pulling back and just maybe holding
},
{
    354.0,357.44
     for about five seconds and relaxing. So we're going to do a couple sets of these
},
{
    357.44,361.88
     through the 30 second period. So again pulling back, keeping that chin level,
},
{
    361.88,368.16
     almost like if you're sitting in a tall chair, you're trying to push your head into the back of the chair. You can also do this
},
{
    368.16,372.66
     against the wall if you need a target and then just push your head into the
},
{
    372.66,377.06
     wall. So again you only have to hold it for maybe three to five seconds we're
},
{
    377.06,379.98
     gonna keep on going because this one would be the full minute of the chin
},
{
    379.98,384.2
     tuck. So again just pulling in you can say I got lots of little chins right
},
{
    384.2,388.84
     there but you should feel the muscles working and stretching at the same time. So this
},
{
    388.84,393.68
     is kind of a combination of a stretch and an exercise. Remember, make sure you're
},
{
    393.68,397.36
     not holding it for 30 seconds for this one. You're just holding it for about
},
{
    397.36,401.16
     three to five seconds and kind of doing those continuously. So you should
},
{
    401.16,409.46
     definitely get a couple in there and then just take that break. So now with that last break, the last stretch is going to be coming in and this is going
},
{
    409.46,412.92
     to be using a towel to get this big stretch.
},
{
    412.92,419.06
     So I'm taking my opposite hand and grabbing here and then bringing this up over my ear
},
{
    419.06,424.66
     and not over my neck, but up and over, I'm pulling down here and I'm pulling up towards
},
{
    424.66,425.36
     the ceiling.
},
{
    425.36,429.74
     This just helps you get a stretch a little bit more what I would call
},
{
    429.74,434.94
     segmentally of your cervical spine because you're stabilizing the
},
{
    434.94,439.32
     lower part and then you're rotating up the other one. So this one's a really
},
{
    439.32,444.64
     nice way to get a really good stretch and it's sometimes helps kind of
},
{
    444.64,445.92
     mobilize the
},
{
    445.92,450.56
     spine as well. So now I'm grabbing this side bringing it up over where my ear is
},
{
    450.56,454.8
     so I'm actually going up towards the ceiling and over and then down with
},
{
    454.8,459.24
     this one and getting that nice pull in there. So don't bring it down low where
},
{
    459.24,462.64
     you're choking yourself we don't want that but getting that nice stretch in
},
{
    462.64,467.4
     there and this is one of my favorite stretches because I really feel like it isolates out of that stretch
},
{
    468.28,473.4
     Gets that neck stretch. So if you're having that pain in there, it's really gonna get a good stretch
},
{
    473.8,474.96
     So there you have it
},
{
    474.96,478.68
