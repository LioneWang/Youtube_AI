     Hi, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist and I am Brad, anti-physical therapist.
},
{
    6.16,10.6
     I'm so glad and together we are the most famous physical therapists on the internet.
},
{
    10.6,12.2
     In our opinion of course Bob.
},
{
    12.2,18.84
     Brad, everybody has a headache in their life and no not everybody does but what we have
},
{
    18.84,24.12
     found is that 15 to 20 percent of people who have headaches, that neck is actually the cause
},
{
    24.12,25.0
     of the pain.
},
{
    25.0,26.0
     And usually the upper neck.
},
{
    26.0,27.0
     Yeah, usually the upper neck.
},
{
    27.0,32.28
     And this is a treatment that, top three treatments that a lot of you can do very easily, very
},
{
    32.28,35.28
     easy to try, and we recommend that you do.
},
{
    35.28,36.28
     So let's go ahead and start.
},
{
    36.28,37.28
     Sure.
},
{
    37.28,41.96
     The first one, Brad, is, again, we've just talked about this in our last video, how a
},
{
    41.96,45.92
     lot of people are now spending a lot of time on their computers or laptops
},
{
    45.92,50.68
     And they got this forward head posture and that what happens is the muscles started tighten up here, Brad
},
{
    50.88,53.88
     So what you're gonna want to do is chin tucks and we've said this
},
{
    54.68,57.64
     Adnazium at a lot of our videos. You want to go ahead and show up Brad? Sure
},
{
    58.12,63.32
     So we're gonna do this opposite motion the chin tucks in towards your throat and everything goes back
},
{
    63.56,65.92
     Like someone's gonna take a pie and throw it in your face
},
{
    65.92,68.46
     And you're going to do that so it's not down here
},
{
    68.46,70.8
     But it's in and back it's kind of a strange motion
},
{
    71.18,74.58
     Some people have a hard time doing it if you want to add a little pressure
},
{
    74.58,78.18
     But feels good here and you push a little more you can do that
},
{
    78.18,83.16
     But you don't have to it's just a simple chin tuck and oftentimes good enough and you a lot of times
},
{
    83.16,84.24
     I'll have patients say yeah
},
{
    84.24,87.44
     I feel it stretch right back in here and that's what you want to do
},
{
    87.44,92.64
     I've seen people to take the you know the crease of their and go like this and really stretch it
},
{
    92.64,98.28
     Yeah, and that sometimes that feels really good Brad to do that stretch and it makes funny faces too. Yeah
},
{
    99.8,106.28
     Surprise all your friends, but so that's number one you you wanna make sure, and if you are all day long like this,
},
{
    106.28,108.16
     maybe you wanna try to correct your work station
},
{
    108.16,110.6
     so that you're gonna end up in this area here,
},
{
    110.6,113.24
     your head's equal with the screen
},
{
    113.24,115.32
     so that you're not down like this all day long.
},
{
    115.32,117.46
     Because again, that can be causing your headache.
},
{
    117.46,119.38
     All right, the second thing you wanna try
},
{
    119.38,122.32
     is to go ahead and just do a massage to this area.
},
{
    122.32,130.0
     Yeah, so yeah, good position there Brad. And a lot. And what I like to do is just take two fingers like this and pull it across.
},
{
    130.0,149.0
     So yeah, do you see how Brad is doing that? You got to focus on something you can easily do throughout the day, you know, if you're having trouble
},
{
    149.0,150.0
     with it.
},
{
    150.0,153.0
     Yeah, little circular, but you're working right in that area.
},
{
    153.0,158.0
     A lot of the pain, let's talk about where the pain often is when you're having neck
},
{
    158.0,159.0
     headaches, Brad.
},
{
    159.0,164.0
     It actually is often a lot of times starting here and it'll radiate off to one side or
},
{
    164.0,168.22
     the other sometimes. Sometimes they'll go behind the eye, sometimes it's like that tight
},
{
    168.22,173.26
     band feeling right around your whole head. I think that we can see the reason
},
{
    173.26,177.54
     that is is a lot of the occipital nerves come off the greater occipital nerve.
},
{
    177.54,182.5
     That's how they travel. That's their path and so that's why it's
},
{
    182.5,187.64
     sending pain there. That's especially at C1. C2 often can often send pain into here too
},
{
    187.92,193.22
     So the third thing you might try is just simply take some ice and put it on that area
},
{
    193.26,199.06
     Now we just showed how to make an ice pack out of rice and a sock
},
{
    199.32,203.36
     A clean sock a clean sock and I'll put that video up right here
},
{
    203.36,210.0
     But the other way this is the most simplest way of all, if you just have a little baggy,
},
{
    210.0,215.8
     little plastic baggy, Ziploc and you take a washcloth and you wet it and then you put
},
{
    215.8,220.28
     that in the freezer and freeze it up, this isn't frozen right now.
},
{
    220.28,222.8
     But it works out really good, it's just very simple to do.
},
{
    222.8,226.24
     I'd rather use a bigger bag if you have one.
},
{
    226.24,231.44
     And you just put it on there and then you can, well actually that's why the rice pack
},
{
    231.44,233.66
     might work, it can just sit there.
},
{
    233.66,236.48
     But if you can have it somehow so it just stays there.
},
{
    236.48,239.12
     Sit in the recliner and to do that.
},
{
    239.12,243.08
     And ice that baby up right in there and that may take away the headache there.
},
{
    243.08,249.36
     So obviously I mean you can obviously try ibuprofen or some type of whatever works for your for pain relief but those things
},
{
    249.36,253.26
     these are the things we're trying to do to stop it from happening again right so it's
},
{
    253.26,257.44
     an massage and the sun is just treating the symptoms are going to we're trying to eliminate
},
{
    257.44,263.16
     so the pain doesn't happen again the other thing helps is if you get the stress out
},

    263.16,267.68
