     So you can also go to Twitter, Instagram or TikTok
},
{
    75.92,77.8
     if you want a 60 second version of our program.
},
{
    77.8,80.4
     We've been already talking and up read.
},
{
    80.4,82.04
     We had complaints of the users.
},
{
    82.04,83.6
     Yeah.
},
{
    83.6,87.64
     Anyways, so shoulder decompression,
},
{
    87.64,90.2
     it's really traction, this is nothing new.
},
{
    90.2,91.48
     There's different names for it,
},
{
    91.48,93.44
     but this has been going on for decades
},
{
    93.44,95.72
     and there's been a little changes throughout the time,
},
{
    95.72,96.72
     but we're gonna show you three
},
{
    96.72,99.92
     and actually three and a half options
},
{
    99.92,101.24
     that you can do at home.
},
{
    101.24,104.72
     It's very important that none of these create any pain.
},
{
    104.72,108.32
     They should feel good while you're doing it and afterwards.
},
{
    108.32,111.08
     So don't get too aggressive, start out gently.
},
{
    111.08,115.8
     And the whole goal is to take the joint, the shoulder joint,
},
{
    115.8,120.4
     and relax the muscles, maybe slightly gap the joint
},
{
    120.4,122.0
     so you can get synovial fluid in there,
},
{
    122.0,125.28
     increase circulation as a result of that.
},
{
    125.28,126.12
     And-
},
{
    126.12,127.3
     If you do it over time,
},
{
    127.3,129.2
     you actually could be reshaping things.
},
{
    129.2,130.04
     Right.
},
{
    130.04,131.04
     I mean, some of these,
},
{
    131.04,133.24
     you could, yeah, like to the point where,
},
{
    133.24,135.4
     like you can move teeth with braces on,
},
{
    135.4,137.84
     you know, you can actually move the bone a little bit,
},
{
    137.84,138.82
     or the ligaments, especially.
},
{
    138.82,139.66
     Right, yeah.
},
{
    139.66,141.68
     And that's actually explained here in this book,
},
{
    141.68,144.36
     by a shoulder surgeon, Dr. Kersh,
},
{
    144.36,145.92
     that we have for one of the options.
},
{
    145.92,146.88
     And we'll go into that more
},
{
    146.88,147.72
     when we talk about the hanging.
},
{
    147.72,148.72
     Okay, so you know more.
},
{
    148.72,150.16
     So should we get right into it Bob?
},
{
    150.16,151.0
     Yeah, let's go.
},
{
    151.0,153.48
     So the first one Brad and I have been doing for years.
},
{
    153.48,155.4
     I mean, therapists have been doing this for years.
},
{
    155.4,158.68
     It's a great one, you know, like after surgery
},
{
    158.68,160.92
     and if you're just having some pain,
},
{
    160.92,162.12
     it's the one you start off with,
},
{
    162.12,164.88
     you're trying to get some motion in the shoulder
},
{
    164.88,166.56
     and you're trying to get it to relax. Yes. So you start off, it's the one you start off with, you're trying to get some motion in the shoulder and you're trying to get it to relax.
},
{
    166.56,169.08
     So you start off, it's called the Codmans
},
{
    169.08,171.12
     or the pendulum exercise.
},
{
    171.12,172.16
     You're leaning on a chair,
},
{
    172.16,174.0
     you're gonna work this shoulder.
},
{
    174.0,176.0
     Now watch my tie.
},
{
    176.0,180.2
     You can actually see that I'm not moving the tie at all,
},
{
    180.2,182.28
     but the pendulum, my body is moving it.
},
{
    182.28,184.8
     And that's what works best for your arm even.
},
{
    184.8,186.8
     Don't be like this.
},
{
    186.8,190.48
     Actually, let the pendulum move it back and forth.
},
{
    190.48,192.68
     And you can go back and forth this way.
},
{
    193.68,195.0
     And you're gonna go in a circle.
},
{
    195.0,197.08
     And my tie, you're gonna go in a circle?
},
{
    197.08,198.72
     Yeah, you really gotta get that body moving.
},
{
    198.72,201.52
     The whole goal is when I explain this to my patients,
},
{
    201.52,203.96
     I say, pretend your arm is like that tie
},
{
    203.96,205.6
     or like it's completely jello.
},
{
    205.6,207.44
     There's no muscle in it.
},
{
    207.44,210.08
     It doesn't move unless the body moves
},
{
    210.08,213.24
     and then the weight of your arm serves as
},
{
    213.24,215.32
     the vehicle protraction.
},
{
    215.32,218.8
     Distraction and also for relaxation.
},
{
    218.8,221.52
     Because those muscles tend to get tight in people.
},
{
    221.52,224.8
     So again, forward and back, side to side
},
{
    224.8,226.88
     and circle one way and circle the other way.
},
{
    226.88,229.92
     Right, you're gonna spend maybe one to two minutes there
},
{
    229.92,231.4
     the most.
},
{
    231.4,233.24
     It's a good one to do throughout the day.
},
{
    233.24,234.64
     The further you bend over,
},
{
    234.64,237.24
     we always, I always have people lean on something with a hand
},
{
    237.24,238.64
     so your back doesn't get sore
},
{
    238.64,240.2
     just in case you have back problems.
},
{
    240.2,242.44
     You can actually do it from this angle
},
{
    242.44,243.6
     and work your way down to this angle.
},
{
    243.6,245.24
     That's one thing I forgot to show Brad though,
},
{
    245.24,246.52
     that this is one of the things,
},
{
    246.52,248.8
     it's a sneaky way of getting motion too.
},
{
    248.8,253.16
     So let's say I can get it moving up to here.
},
{
    253.16,255.6
     If I stand up, look how far my shoulder's up.
},
{
    255.6,256.44
     Right.
},
{
    256.44,259.32
     So it's a sneaky way of getting motion in the shoulder too.
},
{
    259.32,260.16
     That's why.
},
{
    260.16,261.88
     We're not recommending that you do that.
},
{
    261.88,262.72
     No, no.
},
{
    262.72,263.56
     Unless it doesn't hurt.
},
{
    263.56,266.56
     Right, but we're showing you how much motion you actually get.
},
{
    266.56,269.0
     That exercise has been given for more,
},
{
    269.0,272.08
     you could try that pretty much with any sore shoulder
},
{
    272.08,274.12
     and it'll probably offer relief.
},
{
    274.12,274.96
     Right.
},
{
    274.96,275.8
     Unless it's some unusual thing,
},
{
    275.8,277.8
     but doctors give that so many times.
},
{
    277.8,278.64
     Right, right.
},
{
    278.64,280.4
     Without even telling you to go to therapy.
},
{
    280.4,284.56
     The next one, however, this one is a little more aggressive,
},
{
    284.56,287.26
     oftentimes used for impingement.
},
{
    287.26,290.78
     So if you have pain here and over that,
},
{
    290.78,293.3
     it's probably an impingement this one does.
},
{
    293.3,296.56
     And we're using the book that I referred to before.
},
{
    296.56,298.3
     Yeah, again, shoulder pain, the solution
},
{
    298.3,300.68
     and prevention, we'll have a link below.
},
{
    300.68,303.36
     Dr. Kirsten, really, he's a retired orthopedic surgeon,
},
{
    303.36,304.42
     really cool guy.
},
{
    304.42,308.4
     Yep. And it also works well for rotator cuff injuries.
},
{
    308.4,312.0
     So he has example after example,
},
{
    312.0,314.44
     and testimonial after testimonial,
},
{
    314.44,315.92
     that talks about how this works.
},
{
    315.92,319.76
     And this could be used for frozen shoulder,
},
{
    319.76,321.16
     depends on what phase you're in.
},
{
    321.16,323.48
     Yeah, if you're in the thawing phase,
},
{
    323.48,324.8
     not the unthawing phase.
},
{
    324.8,326.92
     If your shoulder only goes this high, it's not gonna work.
},
{
    326.92,330.24
     But if you're up to about here, you can start to do this.
},
{
    330.24,332.12
     And you can use a pull-up bar.
},
{
    332.12,334.36
     Okay, if this was a pull-up bar,
},
{
    334.36,335.8
     and it's nice not to have it so high,
},
{
    335.8,337.88
     you have to jump for it so you can just grab it
},
{
    337.88,340.2
     and gently let your body down.
},
{
    340.2,343.8
     We found the next thing better than a pull-up bar
},
{
    343.8,346.5
     is actually have these hanging handles.
},
{
    346.5,348.38
     One of the reasons I really like them
},
{
    348.38,350.1
     is because I can lean up against the wall
},
{
    350.1,351.94
     so my posture is perfect.
},
{
    351.94,356.04
     And I could slowly slide my body down against the wall
},
{
    356.04,358.36
     to get the traction I want.
},
{
    358.36,359.76
     Because when you first start,
},
{
    359.76,362.44
     you don't wanna have your full body weight.
},
{
    362.44,363.82
     Again, no pain.
},
{
    363.82,366.9
     So if I go down, I got 50% body weight,
},
{
    366.9,368.36
     that might be comfortable,
},
{
    368.36,370.88
     but I go further than you get pain.
},
{
    370.88,373.58
     Just go towards not painful.
},
{
    373.58,376.92
     And then after a few days of doing this,
},
{
    376.92,378.76
     and I'm actually treating this,
},
{
    378.76,380.12
     I have an impingement problem,
},
{
    380.12,382.5
     I left shoulder right now from slimming.
},
{
    382.5,383.6
     So I'm treating it right now.
},
{
    383.6,385.6
     So I'll do a little treatment right now.
},
{
    385.6,388.44
     And I can actually, I feel comfortable doing this.
},
{
    388.44,389.88
     Actually it feels good.
},
{
    389.88,392.84
     And I'll hold it for 15 to 30 seconds.
},
{
    392.84,393.84
     And then you'll give it a break
},
{
    393.84,396.2
     and maybe do it two to three times.
},
{
    396.2,397.24
     The book is excellent.
},
{
    397.24,398.56
     I think it's only like $10.
},
{
    398.56,399.76
     If you got a shoulder problem
},
{
    399.76,402.2
     and you wanna get the details,
},
{
    402.2,404.12
     you're welcome to get one of those.
},
{
    404.12,406.4
     The next step is the Statue of Liberty.
},
{
    406.4,409.52
     Right, you could do this too instead of hanging.
},
{
    409.52,410.92
     It's pretty close to it.
},
{
    410.92,414.76
     It does similar action on its own.
},
{
    414.76,416.28
     We have the Booyah stick here.
},
{
    416.28,418.08
     You could use any stick,
},
{
    418.08,420.32
     along as it kind of got grip on it.
},
{
    420.32,424.44
     I mean, it would need like maybe tape on a bar or, well.
},
{
    424.44,426.6
     Yeah, or you could use some of this stuff
},
{
    426.6,428.08
     right here.
},
{
    428.08,428.92
     Sure.
},
{
    428.92,430.4
     Liner, shelf liner, something.
},
{
    430.4,432.56
     You don't want it to slip on the floor or the chair.
},
{
    432.56,433.44
     You'll see.
},
{
    433.44,434.6
     So if you're shorter,
},
{
    434.6,436.6
     you can actually probably put it on the floor.
},
{
    436.6,437.44
     Yeah.
},
{
    437.44,440.36
     And let's say my shoulder only goes up this high.
},
{
    440.36,443.32
     So what you're gonna do is you put it in place here
},
{
    443.32,444.92
     and you're gonna lean forward like this.
},
{
    444.92,447.9
     And you can see how I'm actually pulling on the shoulder
},
{
    447.9,448.9
     and getting traction.
},
{
    448.9,450.5
     The humerus is pulling this way,
},
{
    450.5,452.38
     a little traction on that joint
},
{
    452.38,455.46
     and you can control, that's a really nice thing about this.
},
{
    455.46,458.42
     You can control the force by how far you're lean.
},
{
    458.42,460.9
     If it gets really good, then you can bring the,
},
{
    460.9,461.74
     the way it's doing.
},
{
    461.74,464.1
     I was just gonna mention, Brad, with arthritis,
},
{
    464.1,466.88
     I've had many patients that started with this,
},
{
    466.88,469.38
     and they were only able to get the arm up this high,
},
{
    469.38,472.56
     and they started by this, and they love it,
},
{
    472.56,474.08
     because then they can see the progress,
},
{
    474.08,476.64
     like, oh, now I can move up a little higher.
},
{
    476.64,478.16
     You should put stripes on the bulliastache.
},
{
    478.16,480.08
     Yeah, we should have, we should have like a...
},
{
    480.08,481.08
     Put some numbers on there.
},
{
    481.08,484.68
     Yeah, and they worked their way up.
},
{
    484.68,487.12
     But yeah, as Brad was alluding to,
},
{
    487.12,488.68
     if you get up on the chair,
},
{
    488.68,490.08
     and especially a tall person like me,
},
{
    490.08,491.96
     I can go all the way up now.
},
{
    491.96,494.76
     And now I can lead forward and really get up.
},
{
    494.76,496.28
     Now you're getting close to the chair.
},
{
    496.28,497.36
     Yeah, now I'm getting to that.
},
{
    497.36,499.6
     This is, I mean, you can put force on this.
},
{
    499.6,501.56
     So this is where you really have to have something,
},
{
    501.56,505.84
     you know, a cushion chair or something that doesn't slip.
},
{
    505.84,508.4
     Right, but this is nice because you can do it
},
{
    508.4,509.8
     without the handles.
},
{
    509.8,511.4
     I mean, you can do it anywhere.
},
{
    511.4,512.68
     Absolutely.
},
{
    512.68,514.68
     All right, and the last one,
},
{
    514.68,516.76
     this one is actually one that-
},
{
    516.76,518.0
     It's vented by Braden.
},
{
    518.0,519.96
     Yeah, so be careful with this one,
},
{
    519.96,523.32
     but I found it offers some relief to my shoulder.
},
{
    523.32,525.92
     If you have a chair and you have a couple rungs down here,
},
{
    525.92,529.72
     this is a stool, but a chair and you can take a belt
},
{
    529.72,531.36
     and you have to get the belt the right length,
},
{
    531.36,532.88
     so I already adjusted it.
},
{
    532.88,535.24
     I'm gonna put it right here in the crux of my elbow,
},
{
    535.24,537.52
     put my hand on my thigh,
},
{
    537.52,539.32
     and now I'm just gonna lean like this
},
{
    539.32,542.76
     and I'm gonna relax the shoulder and I'm gonna test it.
},
{
    542.76,544.76
     Put a little traction so as I lean forward,
},
{
    544.76,547.8
     the belt stationary, there's traction on it now.
},
{
    547.8,551.44
     And if it feels good, I'll hold it for 10 to 15 seconds.
},
{
    551.44,553.44
     And it's funny, I palpated,
},
{
    553.44,556.8
     which means I touch, Brad, and felt there.
},
{
    556.8,558.48
     And you can actually feel a gap.
},
{
    558.48,561.12
     Yeah, they call it the sulcus sign.
},
{
    561.12,564.04
     But again, only gonna do this if it feels good
},
{
    564.04,565.76
     while you're doing it. And then when you're done, it should still feel good. if it feels good while you're doing it and then when you're done
},
{
    566.4,570.32
     it should still feel good. If it feels good while you're doing it and you take it off it's like oh it
},
{
    570.32,576.72
     kind of irritated it, but that's off. You're not gonna do it. It has to feel good before and afterwards.
},
{
    576.72,585.0
     I actually think this would feel good on arthritis even Brad. Yeah. Because some distraction and it actually
},
{
    585.68,589.16
     can stretch that joint out a little bit.
},
{
    589.16,590.0
     It capsules.
},
{
    590.0,591.76
     Yeah, capsules, that's what I was trying to say.
},
{
    591.76,594.24
     I found that I've been using these loops
},
{
    594.24,595.88
     for exercising at home.
},
{
    595.88,598.24
     I just started it recently, but they were good for this.
},
{
    598.24,601.64
     They have a little stretch, it works better than a belt.
},
{
    601.64,605.36
     Yeah, I've seen them used for stuff like this many times.
},
{
    605.36,606.88
     And so I'm gonna adjust it right there
},
{
    606.88,608.12
     and just hold it here.
},
{
    608.12,609.52
     And now there's some give.
},
{
    609.52,611.6
     And it's not like the belt where it's like,
},
{
    611.6,612.76
     you bottom out right away.
},
{
    612.76,613.92
     This has a little give.
},
{
    613.92,617.08
     It gives you a little more flexibility,
},
{
    617.08,618.88
     or not flexibility, I guess flexibility,
},
{
    618.88,620.56
     variation on the pressure.
},
{
    620.56,621.4
     Right.
},
{
    621.4,623.8
     So it works a little bit better, I like it.
},
{
    623.8,625.38
     So anyways, that's it.
},
{
    625.38,627.98
     Again, do all these, chime out,
},
{
    627.98,629.5
     only the ones that feel good.
},
{
    629.5,630.34
     Works out for you.
},
{
    630.34,631.54
     You've got to increase pain.
},
{
    631.54,633.74
     The other thing is, you have increased pain
},
{
    633.74,635.16
     right afterwards.
},
{
    635.16,636.94
     You don't want to do it either.
},
{
    636.94,639.34
     Now, if you have increased pain a couple of days later,
},
{
    639.34,640.98
     it probably wasn't this.
},
{
    640.98,641.82
     Right, yeah.
},
{
    641.82,646.28
     So listen to your body, do not go after it crazy hard right away.
},
{
    646.28,648.36
     You know guys, you're the ones that are probably
},
{
    648.36,650.96
     gonna do that like Bob and I would, but we've learned.
},
{
    650.96,652.24
     Does your body talking to you?
},
{
    652.24,653.68
     You say, listen to your body.
},
{
    653.68,656.6
     Well Bob, of course, I get in the zone.
},
{
    656.6,658.4
     I listen.
},
{
    658.4,659.24
     All right.
},
{
    659.24,660.48
     It all comes to me.
},
{
    660.48,661.32
     Geez.
},
{
    661.32,None
     Take care.
},
