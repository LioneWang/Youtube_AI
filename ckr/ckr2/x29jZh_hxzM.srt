     Hi, I'm Joe Nemeth. I'm a periodontist in Southfield, Michigan.
},
{
    4.0,11.0
     And today I think we're going to talk about what can we do to minimize getting long in the tooth.
},
{
    11.0,16.0
     Now the term long in the tooth, it comes from people getting older,
},
{
    16.0,19.0
     because when they get older, their gums tend to recede.
},
{
    19.0,23.0
     So you don't want to be long in the tooth if you've been avoided.
},
{
    23.0,26.14
     It's not necessarily a complementary term.
},
{
    26.14,29.86
     What are some of the things that cause being long in the tooth?
},
{
    29.86,32.26
     Well, clenching or grinding during your sleep
},
{
    32.26,33.72
     can contribute to that.
},
{
    33.72,35.94
     But one of the main things, and one of the things
},
{
    35.94,39.08
     that I almost always see, is over-vigorous or improper
},
{
    39.08,40.68
     tooth brushing.
},
{
    40.68,43.48
     Because if you're brushing your teeth too frequently,
},
{
    43.48,47.24
     if you're a clean freak or a neat freak and you got to get those teeth clean,
},
{
    47.24,51.6
     you're likely to cause more damage than good. The more you brush your teeth
},
{
    51.6,55.6
     and the longer you brush for and the harder the brush,
},
{
    55.6,59.04
     the more you're going to traumatize and irritate those tissues.
},
{
    59.04,63.56
     So you have to be very careful with your brush. Let me give you an example of what can happen.
},
{
    63.56,67.6
     Okay, here are some teeth right here
},
{
    67.6,73.36
     and here's the gum tissue. Well, if you're brushing and you're brushing real vigorously,
},
{
    73.36,77.84
     look at what's going on. Can you see that recession right there?
},
{
    77.84,83.2
     That yellow stuff? That's the roots of the teeth. The roots of the teeth tend to be yellow.
},
{
    83.2,86.0
     They don't look so good. And then if you continue
},
{
    86.0,91.12
     brushing, the gum tissue that's left isn't gum tissue anymore. It's what's called mucosa.
},
{
    91.12,96.48
     Mucosa isn't meant to withstand the forces of brushing and it tends to get irritated
},
{
    96.48,102.04
     and sore very easily. The other thing to remember is when you have gum recession, that gum is
},
{
    102.04,108.08
     attached to the bone. Therefore, if you lose gum, you're likely to lose bone with it.
},
{
    108.08,110.52
     It's the bone that holds the teeth in.
},
{
    110.52,116.6
     So if you lose gum, you lose bone, you lose support for the tooth, the tooth then becomes
},
{
    116.6,119.66
     loose, you're more at risk for losing that tooth.
},
{
    119.66,121.34
     What else about recession?
},
{
    121.34,127.44
     People come to me, I can't have anything cold or whenever air hits it
},
{
    127.44,132.04
     or when I brush it, it's really sensitive. Why is it sensitive? Because the roots are
},
{
    132.04,137.88
     much more sensitive than the crowns are and when those roots are exposed, they're sensitive.
},
{
    137.88,143.68
     Sometimes they come in because I don't like the way it looks. I mean this is really bad,
},
{
    143.68,148.08
     can you do something about that? So the appearance is another reason.
},
{
    148.08,151.84
     Sometimes people come in because when they're brushing it's just really sore.
},
{
    151.84,154.36
     Also the roots are more subject to decay.
},
{
    154.36,159.4
     So again if you have recession you can get decay more easily on that dentin because it's
},
{
    159.4,160.92
     not an amul.
},
{
    160.92,169.08
     So when you brush, if you really want to be safe, use a soft brush and kind of direct
},
{
    169.08,175.24
     the bristles toward the gum and brush downward on the top, wiggling it slightly coming down,
},
{
    175.24,180.16
     wiggling it slightly coming down so that you're not scrubbing it hard and causing it to recede
},
{
    180.16,185.34
     any more than necessary. A lot depends on your tissue type too. If you have thin
},
{
    185.34,189.94
     gums, you have to be way more careful than if you have thick heavy tissue. That
},
{
    189.94,194.1
     thick heavy tissue can withstand brushing better. If you've had braces very
},
{
    194.1,198.06
     often that'll cause the roots of the teeth to be more prominent or you simply
},
{
    198.06,202.02
     may have more prominent roots. That's another thing that makes recession much
},
{
    202.02,208.22
     more likely. So thin tissue, prominent roots, be careful.
},
{
    208.22,211.44
     If you've had trauma or injury, sometimes that can cause recession.
},
{
    211.44,216.32
     But the main thing is the tissue type combined with toothbrushes is what we find.
},
{
    216.32,229.64
     When we do have recession, what we can do is actually take gum tissue from another area and actually put it right there and I'm
},
{
    229.64,232.54
     stealing gum tissue from an area that I shouldn't be stealing it from which we
},
{
    232.54,237.98
     don't normally do and we can repair that we can largely repair it by doing a
},
{
    237.98,243.12
     graft but the worst this recession the more difficult it is to repair and
},
{
    243.12,245.64
     here's kind of an interesting example.
},
{
    245.64,248.0
     A young man came to us with a recession
},
{
    248.0,249.24
     around these lower front teeth.
},
{
    249.24,251.24
     You can see how long these roots are, and here,
},
{
    251.24,252.64
     and here, and here.
},
{
    252.64,255.88
     So he took a gum graft, and we placed it in these areas.
},
{
    255.88,258.24
     And you can see how it looks.
},
{
    258.24,259.32
     This tissue is thicker.
},
{
    259.32,260.6
     It's not thin.
},
{
    260.6,263.2
     It's much more resistant to recession.
},
{
    263.2,265.0
     And it's much more comfortable.
},
{
    265.0,268.0
     He's not having the sensitivity that he was having before.
},
{
    268.0,269.0
     Very pleased.
},
{
    269.0,275.0
     So there may be a lot more to this, but this is the essentials about brushing and recession.
},
{
    275.0,280.0
     And recession is something that we like to minimize or avoid if we possibly can.
},
{
    280.0,282.0
     Brush and moderation.
},
{
    282.0,283.0
     Don't be too vigorous.
},
{
    283.0,285.5
     If you've got a problem, check with your dentist and see if something can or't be too vigorous. If you've got a problem check with your dentist
},
{
    285.5,288.5
     and see if something can or should be done about it.
},
{
    288.5,292.5
     Okay, good health, take care, have a good day.
},
