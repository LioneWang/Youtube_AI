     So let's take a closer look at the anatomical landmarks of a baby.
},
{
    7.84,13.6
     Now a baby is normally categorized as any child that's under one year of age.
},
{
    13.6,17.82
     But there's some important things to think about when we're talking about babies.
},
{
    17.82,19.84
     And this is a nice healthy baby.
},
{
    19.84,25.24
     You can tell because her lips are nice and pink, her mucus membrane is nice and pink, her
},
{
    25.24,29.48
     nail beds are nice and pink, she's moving around, she doesn't seem to be in
},
{
    29.48,34.52
     distress whatsoever. A baby who might be in distress especially respiratory wise
},
{
    34.52,39.64
     would maybe have some circle moral cyanosis, blue around the lips and around
},
{
    39.64,47.52
     the the mucus membrane. Her nail beds might also be blue. Don't confuse that with a cold hand of a baby
},
{
    47.52,53.52
     because that can turn blue as well pretty easily. But I really want to pay special attention to the
},
{
    53.52,58.88
     anatomical landmarks that are going to be really important to identify when we're actually treating
},
{
    58.88,70.0
     a baby with CPR or with chest compressions for a choking baby unconscious. So let's take a little closer look at some of those important landmarks that we talk about.
},
{
    70.0,75.0
     As we open up the onesie, we can see the mid nipple line.
},
{
    75.0,80.0
     It's important for us to note that we need to put our two fingers on the center of the chest,
},
{
    80.0,85.0
     right on the sternum, just barely below that mid nipple line.
},
{
    85.0,90.0
     That's when we're going to do that one-third of the depth of the full chest for our compressions
},
{
    90.0,94.0
     at a rate of 100 to 120 times per minute.
},
{
    94.0,100.0
     You can also see now that I have that open, this brachial artery location is right here,
},
{
    100.0,105.64
     right between the bicep and the tricep against that little humorous bone.
},
{
    105.64,107.68
     Because they really don't have much of a neck
},
{
    107.68,109.48
     to find a carotid artery,
},
{
    109.48,112.0
     so we have to actually use the brachial artery
},
{
    112.0,113.24
     for that location.
},
{
    114.24,117.64
     Another thing to keep in mind is you can really see here
},
{
    117.64,120.72
     that they like to, you know, they've got such a big head
},
{
    120.72,122.4
     compared to the rest of their body
},
{
    122.4,129.06
     that it tends to put their chin down on their chest. So we're gonna want to just get something a little bit underneath
},
{
    129.06,134.1
     their shoulder blades is a nice shortcut that's still firm and won't let them sink
},
{
    134.1,137.98
     into the mattress when we're doing compressions but that helps to hold
},
{
    137.98,143.26
     their head in that sniffing position. These are all important landmarks when it
},
{
    143.26,145.86
     comes to where to actually do the
},
{
    145.86,151.26
     compressions. The only other variation is the circumferential compressions where
},
{
    151.26,155.54
     we hold around the baby's chest and we place our thumbs right in that same
},
{
    155.54,162.26
     sternal location. We're also going to take note that this baby's airway is
},
{
    162.26,166.12
     literally only the size approximately of their
},
{
    166.12,171.56
     little pinky. That's a pretty small airway and so as opposed to a child and
},
{
    171.56,177.12
     adult where we do a head tilt chin lift, open the airway, a strong head tilt chin
},
{
    177.12,182.64
     lift or a chin to the chest sometimes is enough to actually occlude the airway
},
{
    182.64,185.6
     and make it difficult for a baby to breathe.
},
{
    185.6,191.0
     So that's why we put them into a slightly sniffing position, not a full head tilt chin
},
{
    191.0,192.0
     lift.
},
{
    192.0,196.36
     Now you can see too that the size of their fist is pretty small.
},
{
    196.36,199.32
     That's approximately the size of their heart.
},
{
    199.32,210.0
     And it's located right under the sternum in the center of their chest. These are all important anatomical landmarks as we move into the actual training segments
},
{
    210.0,216.0
     of how to give effective CPR and chest compressions for the unconscious choking patient.
},
