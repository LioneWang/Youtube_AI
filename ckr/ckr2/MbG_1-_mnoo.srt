     Hey everyone, it's Sarah with RegisteredNursesRN.com and we're going to talk about rolling veins.
},
{
    7.0,11.2
     Have you ever heard the term that someone used whenever they missed an IV and they said,
},
{
    11.2,15.44
     oh, the vein rolled or someone asked you, did the vein roll and you're like, what are
},
{
    15.44,16.44
     they talking about?
},
{
    16.44,20.44
     Well, I remember wondering, what in the world was a rolling vein whenever I was a nursing
},
{
    20.44,21.44
     student?
},
{
    21.44,24.4
     And after I became a nurse, no one really told me what it was.
},
{
    24.4,28.94
     I figured it out for myself because I think a lot of people don't know what the term rolling veins
},
{
    28.94,35.94
     means. What it means whenever a vein rolls is whenever you go to insert into the skin
},
{
    35.94,41.62
     into the vein, you see it. The vein just moves to the side. And here in a second, I want
},
{
    41.62,45.36
     to show you what it looks like when a vein rolls.
},
{
    45.36,49.64
     And I'm going to show you how to tell if you have a rolling vein because some veins are
},
{
    49.64,53.04
     a little bit more susceptible to rolling than other veins.
},
{
    53.04,57.6
     And what you can do to stabilize the vein so it doesn't roll on you because you can
},
{
    57.6,59.56
     prevent this from happening.
},
{
    59.56,64.08
     So things that cause a vein to roll.
},
{
    64.08,66.72
     One thing is excessive skin.
},
{
    66.72,71.4
     If you have a patient who's had a lot of weight loss or they're elderly, they have a lot of
},
{
    71.4,77.96
     saggy skin, that can cause a vein to roll because you see the vein, it's nice, it's plump, you've
},
{
    77.96,84.44
     put on your tourniquet, but if you have excess skin hanging down, it's going to cause, once
},
{
    84.44,86.16
     you go in, that skin to move that vein and it's going to cause once you go in that skin to move
},
{
    86.16,89.6
     that vein and it's going to roll away from you.
},
{
    89.6,94.8
     Another thing is that some veins that are found in the hand on your forearm or your
},
{
    94.8,99.6
     anti-cubital area, which is the AC area, like to roll.
},
{
    99.6,104.2
     If you're not stabilizing the vein, keeping the patient making a fist or keeping the arm
},
{
    104.2,105.6
     straight, it will roll.
},
{
    106.64,110.32
     Patients who move whenever you poke them with the needle, because getting poked with the needle
},
{
    110.32,114.88
     hurts, so whenever you go to poke them with the needle and they move, it can cause the vein to move.
},
{
    115.6,121.12
     And another reason is not stabilizing the vein. Even though if the vein doesn't look like it's
},
{
    121.12,128.38
     going to roll or it's not a rolling vein, It's always a great idea that you stabilize the vein and I'll show you how to do that.
},
{
    128.38,134.68
     So first let's talk about and let me show you how to tell if a vein will roll.
},
{
    134.68,139.08
     Here I wanted to demonstrate for you what it looks like and how to tell if a vein will
},
{
    139.08,140.08
     roll.
},
{
    140.08,143.52
     The best way to assess if the vein that you're going to use is going to roll is to touch
},
{
    143.52,145.64
     it and to see.
},
{
    145.64,149.16
     So right here, if I was going to draw blood or start an IV on this patient, I would use
},
{
    149.16,150.16
     this vein.
},
{
    150.16,153.44
     It is beautiful, it's big, it's engorged, it's great.
},
{
    153.44,154.52
     But let's see if it rolls.
},
{
    154.52,158.96
     So what you do is just take your index finger and just gently move it and watch how I do
},
{
    158.96,159.96
     that.
},
{
    159.96,163.68
     See how that rolls to the side?
},
{
    163.68,166.32
     If when you go in with a needle, what's going to happen, if
},
{
    166.32,170.56
     you're not stabilizing this vein, it's just going to go to the side. And that's what
},
{
    170.56,175.28
     it means rolling vein. Another analogy I like to think of with a rolling vein, think of
},
{
    175.28,179.12
     if you're a fisherman and you're going out fishing and you have your worm and you're
},
{
    179.12,183.28
     needing to put that worm on the hook. The worm's wiggling and you're trying to hook
},
{
    183.28,187.2
     it. And if you don't stabilize that worm, you're not going to be able to hook it. And it's the
},
{
    187.2,191.96
     same concept when trying to get a needle into a vein. If you're not
},
{
    191.96,196.04
     stabilizing this it's just going to roll to the side. So let me show you some
},
{
    196.04,201.4
     ways on how to stabilize the vein. First one thing you can do is you can hold
},
{
    201.4,205.28
     above the insertion point where you're going to go in at.
},
{
    205.28,208.96
     So say you're going to go in right here.
},
{
    208.96,214.44
     What you need to do is just hold above the insertion point and sort of press down a
},
{
    214.44,218.52
     little bit and then just pull back and see that keeps that vein nice and stable and it's
},
{
    218.52,219.52
     really not moving.
},
{
    219.52,223.48
     So whenever we go in with our needle, it's going to stay straight.
},
{
    223.48,227.92
     Another thing you can do is you can hold the skin taut, but watch out for that because
},
{
    227.92,232.4
     see if I hold it too taut, notice how that vein disappears and it goes flat.
},
{
    232.4,233.4
     Not good.
},
{
    233.4,235.12
     So you want to, you can hold it taut.
},
{
    235.12,239.92
     Holding it taut is best for people who have that excess skin that we were talking about.
},
{
    239.92,242.88
     At the beginning you could just take it and just pull it back.
},
{
    242.88,248.72
     If you need help, always get someone to help you. Many times I've had people help me when doing this and the
},
{
    248.72,253.88
     best thing to do another way you can stabilize a vein is have the patient make
},
{
    253.88,259.76
     a fist. So make a fist for me and just the contraction of the fist and holding
},
{
    259.76,264.04
     that down will hold the vein steady so you don't have to hold it on. So anytime
},
{
    264.04,269.38
     you're starting an IV in the hand and the vein is going to roll, have the person
},
{
    269.38,272.36
     make a fist because that will keep the vein nice and straight.
},
{
    272.36,274.96
     Now let me show you a little bit with an AC vein.
},
{
    274.96,279.96
     Okay, I quickly wanted to cover the anti-cubital veins because a lot of times these veins are
},
{
    279.96,285.4
     so good to draw and start IVs on because they're naturally big, but a lot of times
},
{
    285.4,288.4
     new beginners, they have problems with these veins rolling.
},
{
    288.4,293.6
     And one tip I want to give you to prevent missing a vein in the AC is always have your
},
{
    293.6,296.84
     patient bend their elbow out just like that.
},
{
    296.84,300.12
     Have them straighten that out because it'll keep these veins nice and straight.
},
{
    300.12,303.88
     If it's bent like that, whenever you go in, the vein might roll.
},
{
    303.88,309.44
     So just a quick tip, have them extend that arm out and it'll stabilize the vein.
},
{
    309.44,313.28
     And again, you can hold at the insertion point or hold the skin time.
},
{
    313.28,316.08
     But I wanted to share that with you real fast.
},
{
    316.08,322.12
     Okay, so that is how you stabilize a vein that rolls and what a rolling vein is.
},
