     Hello, welcome to another post from Dr. Blake's Healing Soul.

     Today we're going to talk about buddy taping.
},
{
    7.28,16.16
     You can see the toes are numbered 1 for the big toe, 2, 3, 4, 5 for the pinky toe.
},
{
    16.16,24.64
     When you injure your big toe, you can't buddy tape it because it moves too strongly and
},
{
    24.64,27.44
     too differently than the second toe.
},
{
    27.44,31.88
     But if you break your second toe, you can buddy tape it to the third.
},
{
    31.88,36.32
     If you break your third toe, you buddy tape it to the second.
},
{
    36.32,39.96
     If you break your fourth toe, you buddy tape it to the third.
},
{
    39.96,45.96
     If you break your fifth toe, you try to buddy tape it to your fourth, but it depends how
},
{
    45.96,49.72
     big the fifth toe is.
},
{
    49.72,59.24
     So Liz is going to demonstrate using co-band, which is a 3M product, to buddy tape her second
},
{
    59.24,65.54
     toe, which is where pretending is injured to the third toe.
},
{
    65.54,78.04
     Liz takes a 6 inch piece of co-band and wraps it twice around the injured toe.
},
{
    78.04,87.0
     And it's important when you put this tape on that it's not so tight that it causes the toe to throb.
},
{
    87.0,92.2
     You just want some light pressure on the veins to move the swelling out.
},
{
    92.2,97.96
     Then after wrapping it twice around the toe, you go under the adjacent toe that you're
},
{
    97.96,107.52
     going to buddy it to, and then go over the top and secure it down. Now, coban, because it doesn't stick to your skin,
},
{
    107.52,110.84
     has to be massaged in where it overlaps
},
{
    110.84,114.2
     so the tape will stick together.
},
{
    114.2,117.56
     And if you have any problems with it slipping off,
},
{
    117.56,121.72
     you can put a little piece of tape,
},
{
    121.72,133.58
     say paper tape or even scotch tape, say paper tape or even scotch tape, right in this area to secure the the

{
    133.58,139.82
     coban onto the skin. Thank you and I hope this helped you understand how to

{
    139.82,146.54
     buddy tape when you've got a sprained or fractured toe.
