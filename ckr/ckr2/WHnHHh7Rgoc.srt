},
{
    10.96,13.16
     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.
},
{
    13.16,14.48
     Brad Heineck, physical therapist.
},
{
    14.48,16.24
     Together we are the most famous physical therapists
},
{
    16.24,17.08
     on the internet.
},
{
    17.08,17.92
     In our opinion, of course, Bob.
},
{
    17.92,19.44
     We can say that with a straight face.
},
{
    19.44,22.84
     Today we're gonna talk about upper thigh leg pain
},
{
    22.84,28.0
     from a pinched femoral nerve or from her alga peristitica.
},
{
    28.0,28.84
     That's a tough one.
},
{
    28.84,31.32
     Yeah, self, we're gonna show you a self test
},
{
    31.32,33.32
     to see which one you might have.
},
{
    33.32,35.0
     And we're gonna show you a fix.
},
{
    35.0,37.12
     That's right, how to self treat.

     Zin, zin, zin, I think zin.
},
{
    75.96,78.16
     Zin, well, zin, zin, zin.
},
{
    78.16,79.64
     Okay, here we go.
},
{
    79.64,80.72
     What are we talking about?
},
{
    80.72,84.6
     Upper thigh pain, leg pain, it could be numbness, tingling,
},
{
    84.6,87.96
     and it happens in this area.
},
{
    87.96,91.2
     And it can be easily from a pinched nerve.
},
{
    91.2,93.12
     But there's two nerves in that area
},
{
    93.12,96.24
     and they have different jobs they do.
},
{
    96.24,99.48
     Exactly, we're gonna tell you about that.
},
{
    99.48,101.96
     One is the femoral nerve.
},
{
    101.96,105.0
     And the other one is the lateral femoral
},
{
    105.6,109.08
     cutaneous nerve and that's, and I don't know.
},
{
    109.08,111.96
     That's just more of a sensation type of nerve.
},
{
    111.96,113.16
     Yeah, I'm gonna get to that.
},
{
    113.16,114.32
     Oh, sorry, just wait.
},
{
    114.32,115.16
     Jumping ahead.
},
{
    115.16,119.04
     Marellgia peristetica is the medical term
},
{
    119.04,120.48
     and I should have looked that up
},
{
    120.48,122.92
     to see how they came up with that.
},
{
    122.92,124.04
     You know, sometimes I do that.
},
{
    124.04,126.94
     But anyways, that's what they call it.
},
{
    126.94,131.38
     So if you're having pain, numbness, tingling here,
},
{
    132.76,134.28
     there's a difference between the two.
},
{
    134.28,136.34
     If you have femoral nerve,
},
{
    136.34,139.96
     you may have the symptoms down to the shin.
},
{
    139.96,142.9
     If you've got lateral femoral cutaneous nerve problems,
},
{
    142.9,143.74
     it probably-
},
{
    143.74,144.58
     It's gonna stick right here.
},
{
    144.58,145.4
     It's gonna stay up here. It's gonna stay up here.
},
{
    145.4,148.56
     It may refer over to the buttock area a little bit.
},
{
    148.56,150.8
     I'm gonna get Sam over here.
},
{
    151.92,154.42
     And we're gonna show you a little bit of anatomy
},
{
    154.42,156.28
     about this before we get into the treatment
},
{
    156.28,157.6
     so you understand it.
},
{
    158.68,160.48
     Oh, I'm sorry, I wanted to use this.
},
{
    161.52,162.36
     As a nerve?
},
{
    162.36,163.36
     Yep, this is a nerve.
},
{
    163.36,166.24
     And actually, because we got the yellow nerves right up here.
},
{
    166.24,169.36
     It comes from L2, L3.
},
{
    169.36,170.84
     The femoral nerve?
},
{
    170.84,171.8
     They both do.
},
{
    171.8,173.16
     They come from the same level.
},
{
    173.16,175.4
     So they both come up here and then they-
},
{
    175.4,176.24
     I can hold that.
},
{
    176.24,177.92
     Yeah, could you hold that?
},
{
    177.92,179.36
     And nerves are kind of yellow.
},
{
    179.36,182.44
     Like this is kind of close for a demonstration.
},
{
    182.44,185.36
     Comes down in front of the ilium or the pelvis.
},
{
    185.36,187.0
     Now there's some muscles in here.
},
{
    187.0,188.96
     You got the hip flexors.
},
{
    188.96,190.08
     That could be a problem.
},
{
    190.08,192.2
     And it goes through the abdominal.
},
{
    192.2,197.2
     Now the cutaneous nerve actually pierces through
},
{
    198.02,200.76
     the abdominal area and goes to the superficial.
},
{
    200.76,203.48
     Just blow the skin into that fascia area.
},
{
    203.48,206.1
     Now that particular nerve,
},
{
    206.1,207.9
     the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve
},
{
    207.9,210.44
     does not innervate any muscles.
},
{
    210.44,212.8
     So it's just for sensation.
},
{
    212.8,215.48
     So that's a key thing to remember.
},
{
    215.48,218.48
     It says innervate, it means he does not supply.
},
{
    218.48,221.04
     The muscle does not get its strength from that nerve.
},
{
    221.04,224.76
     It doesn't, that nerve does not turn on any muscles on and off.
},
{
    224.76,229.42
     But the femoral nerve, that does control the quadriceps.
},
{
    229.42,231.76
     So that's a big difference.
},
{
    231.76,234.26
     So why do they get in trouble, Brad?
},
{
    234.26,235.94
     The nerves, are they getting pinched by the muscles?
},
{
    235.94,238.62
     Right, right, they can get pinched.
},
{
    238.62,241.36
     And it could be a pinch up in the back.
},
{
    241.36,244.26
     Sure, it could be an actual disc problem.
},
{
    244.26,246.88
     Yep, a disc problem, something of that nature,
},
{
    246.88,249.28
     some scar tissue if there was an injury there.
},
{
    249.28,253.76
     Or it could be where that cutaneous nerve comes out,
},
{
    253.76,255.64
     it can be pinched right in there.
},
{
    255.64,257.2
     They have surgery for this.
},
{
    257.2,258.04
     Sure.
},
{
    258.04,259.88
     Obviously we don't want to go to there.
},
{
    259.88,261.08
     You're gonna try this first.
},
{
    261.08,262.52
     Exactly, right.
},
{
    262.52,266.1
     Now to test if you have-
},
{
    266.1,268.52
     To try to determine which one you have.
},
{
    268.52,270.4
     Right, whether you have the femoral nerve
},
{
    270.4,272.96
     or amyrologia and peristetica,
},
{
    272.96,275.2
     you do a manual muscle test to yourself.
},
{
    275.2,276.6
     It's not that hard.
},
{
    276.6,278.08
     The first thing you can do,
},
{
    278.08,279.52
     let's say this is my right leg,
},
{
    279.52,281.32
     this is where I have the symptoms,
},
{
    281.32,287.54
     and I'm gonna kick out like this and down, and you're gonna compare one leg to the other.
},
{
    287.54,289.18
     Now, if you have difficulty-
},
{
    289.18,290.22
     You've been straightening.
},
{
    290.22,292.98
     Straightening it, that's a pretty severe case.
},
{
    292.98,294.58
     You probably wanna see a doctor.
},
{
    294.58,298.14
     Yeah, and not only that, there's a slight chance
},
{
    298.14,299.58
     you could have tore the muscle too.
},
{
    299.58,301.46
     I mean, and you would have trouble with it too.
},
{
    301.46,305.46
     Right, yeah, so maybe a crossover symptoms.
},
{
    305.46,310.46
     So the next thing to do is a single leg sit to stand test.
},
{
    310.46,312.92
     You need a firm chair with arm rest.
},
{
    312.92,316.36
     And what you're gonna do is test your good leg first.
},
{
    316.36,318.56
     So I'm gonna bring this leg up.
},
{
    318.56,321.3
     I'm gonna stand up with this leg only.
},
{
    321.3,323.5
     You may need, unless you're really strong,
},
{
    323.5,326.44
     you may need and likely need to push up from here.
},
{
    326.44,329.28
     Now I can do pretty easy with both arms.
},
{
    329.28,333.08
     Now I'm gonna take one off and I can go like that.
},
{
    333.08,336.36
     Okay, I'm gonna go just to a fingertips.
},
{
    336.36,339.12
     And, oh, that's about it for me.
},
{
    339.12,340.28
     Okay?
},
{
    340.28,344.72
     Now the other leg, if I need both hands to push up
},
{
    344.72,347.32
     and I go to one hand and it's not going up,
},
{
    347.32,349.78
     it's pretty clear you got a weakness.
},
{
    349.78,353.64
     So you probably have the femoral nerve pinched.
},
{
    353.64,354.48
     Yep.
},
{
    355.48,358.88
     Now you might say, because the next thing I'm gonna say is
},
{
    358.88,363.08
     the treatment we're gonna show you is the same for both.
},
{
    363.08,364.72
     Because the treatments cross over
},
{
    364.72,368.0
     and there's no harm in doing one.
},
{
    368.0,370.08
     Cause the first one is more for the femoral nerve.
},
{
    370.08,370.92
     But-
},
{
    370.92,372.92
     And then all of them, you really wanna make sure
},
{
    372.92,375.16
     there's no pain while doing these.
},
{
    375.16,377.84
     In fact, we're hoping the pain starts going down.
},
{
    377.84,379.16
     Right, some of these, right?
},
{
    379.16,381.6
     Yeah, you should feel a decrease in that.
},
{
    381.6,383.52
     And sometimes when nerve, when you have numbness,
},
{
    383.52,385.08
     tingling, those things,
},
{
    385.08,386.88
     and the nerve starts to feel better,
},
{
    386.88,389.6
     I've had patients as well as myself say,
},
{
    389.6,392.08
     well, it feels like cold water running through now,
},
{
    392.08,394.4
     and it seems like it's getting better,
},
{
    394.4,396.76
     but it changes it for the better.
},
{
    396.76,398.96
     And sometimes it can take a while before it changes,
},
{
    398.96,400.6
     and especially if it's a stretch.
},
{
    400.6,402.64
     So it might be a couple of weeks
},
{
    402.64,404.52
     before you even notice any difference.
},
{
    404.52,406.24
     But you certainly don't want to make it worse.
},
{
    406.24,407.88
     Right, exactly.
},
{
    407.88,410.96
     While you're doing it or after you're done doing it.
},
{
    410.96,412.84
     Yeah, the afterwards is really important.
},
{
    412.84,414.56
     And not just two minutes after,
},
{
    414.56,417.6
     but the next hour or even throughout the day.
},
{
    417.6,420.72
     If the tingling gets worse after you did the exercise,
},
{
    420.72,421.96
     it's not the right thing.
},
{
    421.96,423.48
     Okay, so let's show the first one.
},
{
    423.48,424.48
     You want to show what we're gonna.
},
{
    424.48,427.4
     Extension of the mind. Now there's three options we're gonna show here.
},
{
    427.4,430.04
     So you can try all three of them
},
{
    430.04,433.28
     and then monitor if it's better or worse.
},
{
    433.28,436.56
     So now Bob has, let's say left leg,
},
{
    436.56,438.08
     numbness and tingling.
},
{
    438.08,441.04
     So I'm putting my hands right below my shoulders
},
{
    441.04,442.84
     and I'm doing a press up.
},
{
    442.84,445.84
     And now I'm not lifting up my pelvis.
},
{
    445.84,447.6
     I'm not bringing that up with it.
},
{
    447.6,450.96
     If you're really tight, sometimes it comes up like that.
},
{
    450.96,455.8
     If that's the case, just work on small micro press ups here,
},
{
    455.8,460.2
     or mini press ups, and work your way up further and further,
},
{
    460.2,462.32
     again, keeping the pelvis on the floor.
},
{
    462.32,463.52
     Now this does two things.
},
{
    463.52,466.8
     One, you're working on the back if it's a disc problem,
},
{
    466.8,470.0
     but it's also working on the hip flexors.
},
{
    470.0,472.24
     Stretching them out too.
},
{
    472.24,474.4
     So you're getting kind of two for one here.
},
{
    474.4,477.08
     And you're still getting some of that superficial muscles
},
{
    477.08,478.76
     in the abdominal for that cutaneous.
},
{
    478.76,479.6
     Right, right, yeah.
},
{
    479.6,480.44
     Yeah, you're stretching that too.
},
{
    480.44,483.44
     It really, there's really nothing go wrong with this.
},
{
    483.44,488.44
     If you happen to have spondylastesis or stenosis,
},
{
    488.44,490.44
     this one is probably not gonna be for you.
},
{
    490.44,492.24
     Yeah, and you're gonna wanna do these
},
{
    492.24,493.66
     actually not just once a day,
},
{
    493.66,495.56
     you could do these throughout the day.
},
{
    495.56,496.4
     Exactly.
},
{
    496.4,497.76
     You could do it four to six times,
},
{
    497.76,499.36
     spread out throughout the day
},
{
    499.36,501.32
     and do like a repetitions of 10.
},
{
    501.32,502.16
     Yep.
},
{
    502.16,504.6
     And see again how it responds.
},
{
    504.6,508.4
     If it makes it worse, you're gonna stop it and not do it.
},
{
    508.4,511.54
     If it seems to be helping, you're gonna continue to do it.
},
{
    511.54,512.54
     Exactly.
},
{
    515.62,516.7
     Should we go with number two?
},
{
    516.7,517.66
     Sure, sure.
},
{
    517.66,519.26
     All right.
},
{
    519.26,520.7
     Subine hip extension.
},
{
    520.7,521.9
     You wanna do it or you want me to do it?
},
{
    521.9,523.26
     Okay, good.
},
{
    523.26,526.2
     You can do this off the edge of your bed.
},
{
    526.2,528.76
     You could do it off your couch if it's a firm couch.
},
{
    528.76,530.8
     Yeah, and you want to have your shoulders
},
{
    530.8,531.92
     well onto the bed.
},
{
    531.92,533.16
     You don't want to get to the edge,
},
{
    533.16,536.64
     and except she's some beds where you kind of slide right off.
},
{
    536.64,537.8
     So I'm bringing the leg.
},
{
    537.8,540.0
     This is my involved leg, we'll say now.
},
{
    540.0,542.48
     Now my bad leg by my involved leg.
},
{
    542.48,545.0
     Yeah, because everyone, if you got a leg, it's good.
},
{
    545.0,546.92
     It's better than not having one.
},
{
    546.92,549.16
     So I'm gonna bring this leg up like this
},
{
    549.16,551.08
     because this sets the pelvis.
},
{
    551.08,553.72
     And you can actually see, if I go like this,
},
{
    553.72,555.2
     it actually pulls up.
},
{
    555.2,557.52
     So I'm really stretching that muscle here.
},
{
    557.52,560.16
     And you can actually bring your foot back
},
{
    560.16,563.0
     even a little bit more if you wanna stretch your rectus
},
{
    563.0,567.84
     for more, it's there a little bit more. So this is a real easy stretch to do.
},
{
    567.84,570.56
     You know, you can do it in the morning when you wake up.
},
{
    570.56,573.44
     And this can be done a couple of times a day too.
},
{
    573.44,575.42
     And you could hold this up to 30 seconds
},
{
    575.42,578.12
     or you can just, you know, short or burst if you want to.
},
{
    578.12,580.52
     You can do pressure on, pressure off.
},
{
    580.52,582.76
     Now, if I was in the clinic and I had someone
},
{
    582.76,584.84
     who had good results with this,
},
{
    584.84,585.04
     it's like, oh, that's doing pretty good I had someone have good results with this, it's like,
},
{
    585.04,586.08
     oh, that's doing pretty good.
},
{
    586.08,589.08
     I might even offer a little stretch,
},
{
    589.08,591.04
     gently, very gently stretch that,
},
{
    591.04,594.16
     as long as it feels clearly better.
},
{
    594.16,597.08
     The thing about this is you may wanna do it
},
{
    597.08,599.48
     on your good leg first and see how it feels,
},
{
    599.48,601.68
     and then do that involved with,
},
{
    601.68,604.36
     and compare the good to the bad,
},
{
    604.36,606.4
     and it's gonna give you a good indication
},
{
    606.4,607.84
     on if it's improving or not.
},
{
    607.84,611.44
     Yeah, to tell you right away how tight that one is.
},
{
    611.44,615.04
     It might feel tighter, or it might look tighter.
},
{
    615.04,616.28
     Exactly, Bob.
},
{
    616.28,617.4
     Should we do the last one here?
},
{
    617.4,618.24
     Sure, the kneeling?
},
{
    618.24,619.32
     Yeah, you might as well do that one too.
},
{
    619.32,620.52
     Sure.
},
{
    620.52,622.8
     So I can't remember which way should I always go.
},
{
    622.8,624.08
     This way?
},
{
    624.08,627.92
     You don't like it this, this, this, this way?
},
{
    627.92,628.76
     That do the other way.
},
{
    628.76,629.6
     I think it's easy.
},
{
    629.6,630.44
     I knew I always get it wrong.
},
{
    630.44,632.72
     It's just easier for the viewer to see.
},
{
    632.72,633.9
     There we go.
},
{
    633.9,635.36
     All right, so I'm gonna stretch.
},
{
    635.36,637.64
     This is, I'm stretching the hip flexor here.
},
{
    637.64,640.2
     So I'm keeping very good posture.
},
{
    640.2,641.96
     I can actually even use my hand
},
{
    641.96,644.04
     and push forward a little bit here like this
},
{
    644.04,645.62
     and really stretch her out.
},
{
    645.62,649.8
     So we're really stretching the same muscle groups
},
{
    649.8,651.92
     and structures, but it's a different angle
},
{
    651.92,653.04
     and sometimes it helps.
},
{
    653.04,656.08
     Yeah, and I usually definitely put a pillow down at my age
},
{
    656.08,658.88
     because it's a little rough on the floor.
},
{
    658.88,660.28
     Can you try facing the camera?
},
{
    660.28,661.84
     I wanna show them one little trick
},
{
    661.84,665.32
     that can just accelerate or modify the stretch.
},
{
    666.44,668.68
     Now for this, you gotta have a balance.
},
{
    668.68,671.2
     I'm gonna, you might wanna hold onto this just for balance.
},
{
    671.2,673.92
     Okay, actually with the other arm.
},
{
    673.92,677.08
     Because, so you do your stretch forward.
},
{
    677.08,682.08
     Now take this hand and do this.
},
{
    682.08,684.36
     There, that's the balancing.
},
{
    684.36,687.22
     If you had to, there, so he's gonna lean this way
},
{
    687.22,689.04
     and you feel a little bit more of a stretch on this.
},
{
    689.04,690.06
     Yeah, yeah, you do actually.
},
{
    690.06,692.5
     Yeah, and they say that you get a little flossing
},
{
    692.5,693.34
     with that nerve.
},
{
    693.34,694.18
     Oh, sure.
},
{
    694.18,696.9
     With that as well, so it's always good to add on
},
{
    696.9,697.9
     if things are going good.
},
{
    697.9,699.06
     Interesting.
},
{
    699.06,700.3
     Yeah, so that's the three.
},
{
    700.3,703.42
     And again, with that one, test right to left.
},
{
    703.42,704.46
     Yep.
},
{
    704.46,706.08
     And see how things go.
},
{
    706.08,707.14
     Almost your height.
},
{
    707.14,712.36
     Wow, yeah, it is kind of neat because I'm actually,
},
{
    712.36,715.6
     that must be how you are when you're standing together.
},
{
    715.6,716.44
     It must be how you are.
},
{
    716.44,717.56
     We're pretty close right here.
},
{
    717.56,718.4
     Yeah.
},
{
    718.4,719.24
     That's weird.
},
{
    719.24,721.12
     Yeah, we're getting off on another subject.
},
{
    721.12,722.68
     Good luck with this stretch.
},
{
    722.68,724.12
     You know, all three of those stretches.
},
{
    724.12,726.44
     Do the one that works best and get rid of that.
},
{
    726.44,728.36
     And I'm just tingling and pain.
},
{
    728.36,None
     Thanks for watching. you
},
