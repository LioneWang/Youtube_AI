     Now let's cover the highly effective and very important skill called conscious adult choking.
},
{
    33.44,38.06
     Now in this scenario we have someone who was eating at a table, they began to choke, we
},
{
    38.06,42.08
     know they were choking because they could not cough, they could not breathe, they could
},
{
    42.08,43.52
     not speak.
},
{
    43.52,45.68
     This is a full obstruction and it needs help if
},
{
    45.68,51.2
     it's going to come out in most cases. If it's easy to activate the emergency response team or call
},
{
    51.2,57.92
     911, great. But if not, we can wait until the patient goes unresponsive before we actually take the
},
{
    57.92,63.12
     time to call 911 or activate a code. But in this case, we're going to come up to the person, we're
},
{
    63.12,69.92
     going to look them in the eyes, are you choking? They nod yes. I know how to help you, may I help you? They
},
{
    69.92,75.04
     give me permission to help them, they're still conscious, and so we want to get that permission
},
{
    75.04,80.32
     from the patient if at all possible. Now I'm going to elevate their elbows, I'm going to
},
{
    80.32,85.16
     find the belly button. The belly button is my landmark
},
{
    85.16,87.12
     so that I can tuck my thumb in
},
{
    87.12,90.32
     and put the fist just above the belly button
},
{
    90.32,92.1
     on their abdomen.
},
{
    92.1,94.46
     I wanna stay below the xiphoid process,
},
{
    94.46,96.48
     which is approximately right here.
},
{
    96.48,98.6
     I wanna stay just above the belly button
},
{
    98.6,102.04
     because this is where I find the diaphragmatic region.
},
{
    102.04,103.64
     This is exactly what I want
},
{
    103.64,105.78
     so that I can bring that diaphragm
},
{
    105.78,111.92
     up and in while I compress the lower lobes of the lungs, shoot the air up the trachea,
},
{
    111.92,116.78
     popping that object out, and it's effective the majority of the time. So I'm going to
},
{
    116.78,121.36
     take that hand, keep my elbows out so I'm not on their ribs anymore than I have to be,
},
{
    121.36,132.36
     and I'm going to start with my inward and upward thrusts. And I'm going to do these thrusts until either the object comes out or the person goes unresponsive.
},
{
    132.36,134.94
     In this case, the object did come out.
},
{
    134.94,138.4
     He began breathing, coughing, clearing his own airway.
},
{
    138.4,141.36
     I simply re-encourage him that he's doing fine.
},
{
    141.36,144.72
     If he feels like sitting down, we can have him sit down.
},
{
    144.72,145.4
     And if we
},
{
    145.4,151.0
     had not already called 911, now would be the time to call 911 or call a code if they go
},
{
    151.0,156.98
     unresponsive. If we've already called 911, keep them coming. It's fine. Even though the
},
{
    156.98,162.0
     object came out, it's always a good idea to have EMS stay on the way so that if this person
},
{
    162.0,166.28
     opts not to go in, they can be checked out by the EMS professionals.
},
{
    166.28,167.68
     They're gonna check airway,
},
{
    167.68,169.24
     they're gonna check some lung sounds
},
{
    169.24,171.16
     to make sure there's no partial obstruction,
},
{
    171.16,173.0
     and they're probably gonna do a quick assessment
},
{
    173.0,175.04
     to make sure there's no internal bleeding
},
{
    175.04,176.8
     from the abdominal thrusts.
},
{
    176.8,180.12
     So if the individual does not opt to have
},
{
    180.12,184.36
     that done to them or the EMS providers do not come,
},
{
    184.36,187.92
     I always like to encourage them to go to their own practitioner and just be
},
{
    187.92,190.8
     looked over and made sure that everything is okay.
},
{
    190.8,195.36
     Keep in mind that if this person were not to have this successful
},
{
    195.36,198.96
     removal of the obstruction, they would probably go unresponsive
},
{
    198.96,202.64
     in a short amount of time and it's then that we would assist them to the ground
},
{
    202.64,206.62
     carefully and begin the skill of unconscious adult choking.
},
{
    208.24,210.24
     Now we're going to talk about the special
},
{
    210.38,212.84
     considerations as it relates to a pregnant woman.
},
{
    212.96,220.2
     You know when we're doing this life-saving skill of trying to remove the obstruction from the airway and the person is pregnant,
},
{
    220.2,225.5
     we need to understand that we're dealing with two patients. Save mom, save baby.
},
{
    225.5,227.9
     So it's important that we're aggressive in our treatment,
},
{
    227.9,229.4
     but there's a special way to do it
},
{
    229.4,231.9
     so that we don't injure the baby in the process.
},
{
    231.9,235.8
     Let's take a look at how we do that right now.
},
{
    235.8,238.6
     When we have the person in front of us,
},
{
    238.6,241.5
     we know the baby is here in the normal location
},
{
    241.5,243.6
     where we would do abdominal thrusts.
},
{
    243.6,246.32
     So we're going to avoid the area altogether
},
{
    246.32,249.44
     by forming the fist and going under the breast
},
{
    249.44,251.64
     with that fist on the sternum.
},
{
    251.64,253.32
     We're then going to take the opposite hand,
},
{
    253.32,257.88
     go under the breast, and onto that fist that's on the sternum.
},
{
    257.88,261.52
     We're now going to do inward thrusts, inward deep thrusts.
},
{
    261.52,264.04
     And we're going to continue to do those compressions
},
{
    264.04,267.92
     until the object comes out and the person begins to breathe normally again.
},
{
    268.48,273.28
     If they doesn't come out, they're going to go unconscious. When they go unconscious,
},
{
    273.28,278.8
     we're going to activate 911 and then we're going to start doing our unconscious choking victim
},
{
    278.8,282.4
     compressions as we learned in the other segment.
},
