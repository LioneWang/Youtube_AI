     In this video I'm going to show you how to get rid of arthritic knee pain in as little as 30 seconds

     using an everyday handheld. Stay tuned.

     Hey everyone. Dr. O here at Spine Cure in St. Joseph, Michigan. So let's go over a self-mobilization
},
{
    19.04,29.0
     technique or self-traction that's going to help open up your knee. If you're dealing with a lot of stiffness, tightness, pain, due to arthritis, or maybe you just have a stiff
},
{
    29.0,33.26
     knee from running or going to the gym, especially after squatting, this self
},
{
    33.26,36.74
     traction into the knee is going to help put more range of motion in there,
},
{
    36.74,40.8
     loosen everything up, and the great part is you can do it at home. It doesn't
},
{
    40.8,45.2
     require any special equipment. It's safe, effective, and easy.
},
{
    45.2,47.04
     I'm gonna show you two different variations,
},
{
    47.04,48.88
     so make sure to try both of them
},
{
    48.88,51.12
     and go with the one that feels like it's given you
},
{
    51.12,52.28
     the most amount of relief.
},
{
    52.28,54.08
     So, let's get started with them.
},
{
    54.08,57.96
     So this first knee traction technique has two parts to it.
},
{
    57.96,61.44
     You're going to want to start on a nice flat surface.
},
{
    61.44,63.12
     On the floor is perfect, in bed,
},
{
    63.12,65.5
     if you feel it's firm enough, that should work too.
},
{
    65.5,70.62
     So whatever knee that you're looking to really work on, keep that one bent while the other
},
{
    70.62,73.2
     leg goes completely straight.
},
{
    73.2,76.58
     From there, what I'm going to do is take my hands, I'm going to bend the knee, put them
},
{
    76.58,82.18
     on the shin right here, and drive the heel back until you feel a very gentle stretch
},
{
    82.18,85.48
     into the knee, only to your comfort level. From there,
},
{
    85.48,89.84
     and this is very important, we're going to want to keep the foot flat, but we're
},
{
    89.84,95.06
     going to start to turn it inwards. So take the toes inwards until you're about
},
{
    95.06,100.92
     30 degrees pointing inwards. From there, I'm going to traction just a little bit
},
{
    100.92,104.72
     more into the knee, and I tell you what, you should feel a pretty good stretch.
},
{
    104.72,105.2
     Why it's very important to keep the toes pointed inwards, because it aids in just a little bit more into the knee. And I tell you what, you should feel a pretty good stretch.
},
{
    105.2,109.64
     Why it's very important to keep the toes pointed inwards because it aids in natural movement
},
{
    109.64,110.64
     of the knee.
},
{
    110.64,116.44
     It's more natural for it so these exercises become a little bit more effective towards
},
{
    116.44,120.44
     opening up that knee joint and releasing pressure.
},
{
    120.44,130.26
     So from there, what I like to do is hold that for about 10 to 15 seconds. I relax and then I'm just going to repeat that process upwards to five times.
},
{
    130.26,134.24
     After that, if you're still looking for more traction into the knee, we're going to take
},
{
    134.24,138.1
     a small hand towel and we're going to roll it up just like this.
},
{
    138.1,142.1
     Go back into that position where the knee is bent, but this time place this at the back
},
{
    142.1,143.1
     of the knee.
},
{
    143.1,145.84
     And then from there, start to pull the leg back
},
{
    146.16,148.16
     turn the foot inwards and
},
{
    148.48,153.34
     Really notice that you're going to get a lot of good traction in there when I do this sometimes
},
{
    153.34,158.98
     I actually feel a pop crack or release into the knee joint if that happens through the natural movements
},
{
    158.98,163.26
     It's completely normal. It's just gas being released from the knee
},
{
    163.56,165.3
     But when you do this make sure
},
{
    165.3,168.88
     it's not causing any discomfort. Again what you want to do is hold this for 10
},
{
    168.88,174.44
     seconds, relax, and then repeat upwards to five times. So let's go over the second
},
{
    174.44,178.84
     exercise and see if that one works for you too. So for the second technique it's
},
{
    178.84,183.36
     easiest to do this next to a bed. Whatever knee I'm looking to get some
},
{
    183.36,188.16
     relief in, I'm going to bend it and just place it up just like this. What I'm going to do is I'm going to take
},
{
    188.16,191.58
     that towel, I'm going to place it at the back of the knee, and then I'm going to
},
{
    191.58,195.62
     kind of sandwich it in between this part of the leg and the top part of the leg.
},
{
    195.62,200.34
     It's pretty easy from there. What I'm going to do is just use my body weight
},
{
    200.34,208.6
     and go down on it. So what I'm doing is keeping this bottom part flat, but my butt is going to start to go down towards the floor. You can kind of see
},
{
    208.6,213.64
     right there how I'm just using my body weight to start to help traction that
},
{
    213.64,217.72
     knee joint right there. Only go to your comfort level. I tell you what this
},
{
    217.72,223.76
     causes a lot of good stretching into the knee itself. Again if you get a pop or a
},
{
    223.76,228.92
     crack that's completely normal through the natural movements of the knee. Hold that for about
},
{
    228.92,233.44
     10 to 15 seconds. You're just going to relax and then you just repeat that
},
{
    233.44,239.24
     upwards to five times. And afterwards, notice any differences in the range of
},
{
    239.24,243.36
     motion of the knee. How much pain you're having. If it feels like it's making a
},
{
    243.36,245.0
     big difference at that point,
},
{
    245.0,248.1
     you know it's working for you and keep it going.
},
{
    248.1,251.3
     So give them both a try and go with the ones that you feel
},
{
    251.3,253.0
     are helping you out the most.
},
{
    253.0,255.2
