    2.72,4.92
     to unclog your plugged up ears.

     Hi guys, Cliff Olson, Doctor of Audiology
},
{
    13.4,16.36
     and founder of Applied Hearing Solutions in Anthem, Arizona.
},
{
    16.36,17.84
     And on this channel, I cover a bunch of
},
{
    17.84,19.72
     hearing-related information to help make you
},
{
    19.72,21.12
     a better informed consumer.

{
    21.12,23.72
     So if you're into that, consider hitting the subscribe button.

     Our ears can get plugged up for a variety of reasons. One of those is changing elevations. So whether you're into that, consider hitting the subscribe button. Our ears can get plugged up for a variety of reasons.
},
{
    26.26,28.0
     One of those is changing elevations.
},
{
    28.0,30.18
     So whether you're driving in a car through the mountains
},
{
    30.18,33.18
     or you're on an airplane ascending or descending,
},
{
    33.18,35.06
     you can get the sensation that your ears
},
{
    35.06,36.3
     are being plugged up.
},
{
    36.3,38.28
     Another reason your ears would feel clogged
},
{
    38.28,41.06
     is if you are having a cold or a sinus infection
},
{
    41.06,42.3
     and you have a bunch of mucus
},
{
    42.3,44.12
     that is plugging up your sinuses.
},
{
    44.12,46.2
     So what is actually giving you the sensation
},
{
    46.2,47.4
     that your ears are clogged?
},
{
    47.4,49.4
     Our ears are comprised of an outer ear,
},
{
    49.4,51.24
     middle ear, and inner ear.
},
{
    51.24,53.32
     Our middle ear is connected to our throat
},
{
    53.32,55.06
     by our Eustachian tube.
},
{
    55.06,57.64
     This tube is responsible for keeping the air pressure
},
{
    57.64,60.2
     in our middle ear equal with the air pressure
},
{
    60.2,61.48
     in our outer ear.
},
{
    61.48,64.4
     If the Eustachian tube does not keep things equal,
},
{
    64.4,67.28
     we get this perception that our ears are clogged.
},
{
    67.28,69.32
     So the simple solution to this problem
},
{
    69.32,71.96
     is actually getting air to go through our Eustachian tube
},
{
    71.96,74.76
     into our middle ear space to regulate that pressure.
},
{
    74.76,76.24
     Under normal circumstances,
},
{
    76.24,79.1
     our ears will naturally unclog just by swallowing.
},
{
    79.1,80.68
     But when swallowing isn't enough,
},
{
    80.68,82.96
     you need to use a trick in order to get air
},
{
    82.96,88.72
     through your Eustachian tube into your middle ear space, the first one is called the Val Salva Maneuver.
},
{
    88.72,92.56
     Very simply the Val Salva Maneuver is when you plug your nose and blow.
},
{
    92.56,96.52
     That'll take air, push it through your Eustachian tube into your middle ear space and it will
},
{
    96.52,98.22
     regulate that pressure.
},
{
    98.22,101.8
     If the Val Salva Maneuver isn't getting the job done, then you may have to use our second
},
{
    101.8,103.92
     technique which is the Lowry Method.
},
{
    103.92,109.6
     With the Lowry Method you basically do the same steps as you would with the Val Salva maneuver, but instead of just
},
{
    109.6,115.04
     plugging your nose and blowing, you're plugging your nose, blowing, and swallowing at the same time,
},
{
    115.04,119.6
     that sometimes gets extra air through your station tube and into your middle ear space.
},
{
    119.6,123.92
     If you're not capable of doing those first two techniques, then the third technique is yawning,
},
{
    123.92,125.18
     because when you yawn,
},
{
    125.18,126.82
     it opens up those Eustachian tubes
},
{
    126.82,128.66
     just enough to let some air through.
},
{
    128.66,130.38
     Technique number four is a little bit weird,
},
{
    130.38,131.7
     but you could actually have someone
},
{
    131.7,133.5
     put their lips around your nose,
},
{
    133.5,135.58
     making sure they create a good seal,
},
{
    135.58,139.58
     and they can gently blow into your nose while you swallow.
},
{
    139.58,141.26
     This will force air through the tube,
},
{
    141.26,143.06
     again, into your middle ear space.
},
{
    143.06,144.38
     I wouldn't really recommend it,
},
{
    144.38,147.36
     because it can be dangerous if they're blowing too hard.
},
{
    147.36,149.2
     Instead of doing technique number four,
},
{
    149.2,151.88
     I would probably recommend that you do technique number five,
},
{
    151.88,154.2
     which is actually using the Eustachie.
},
{
    154.2,155.96
     The Eustachie is a very simple product
},
{
    155.96,158.42
     that actually will blow air through your nostril
},
{
    158.42,161.96
     to unclog your Eustachian tubes while you swallow.
},
{
    161.96,164.96
     The concept is that you actually take this little hole
},
{
    164.96,166.44
     right there at the tip of the
},
{
    166.44,171.52
     Eustachie, you'll put that into your nostril and then you'll hit this start button here
},
{
    171.52,176.8
     which will gently force air through your nostril down through your throat and into your Eustachian
},
{
    176.8,177.8
     tubes.
},
{
    177.8,181.2
     It's a much safer method of doing it than having someone wrap their lips around your
},
{
    181.2,182.52
     nose and blowing.
},
{
    182.52,186.26
     When you use it, you'll do something like this right here. You'll hit the start button
},
{
    186.26,188.74
     and you'll feel air go through your nostril
},
{
    188.74,191.14
     and when you feel that air, you're gonna swallow.
},
{
    191.14,193.98
     You'll keep that button pressed down while you're doing it
},
{
    193.98,197.26
     and voila, it forces air through your use station tube
},
{
    197.26,198.7
     and into your middle ear space,
},
{
    198.7,200.98
     getting rid of that clog sensation.
},
{
    200.98,203.02
     Now, if you've tried all of these natural methods
},
{
    203.02,204.54
     and none of them seem to work,
},
{
    204.54,207.08
     your plugged ears could actually be something a little bit more
},
{
    207.08,212.0
     serious. The first one is earwax. If you have a bunch of earwax in your outer
},
{
    212.0,216.32
     ear plugging up your ear canal, it will definitely give you this sensation of
},
{
    216.32,220.52
     being plugged up. In fact, most people think that that's the original cause of
},
{
    220.52,224.6
     their ears feeling clogged, but then when they do some ear washes or they go in
},
{
    224.6,226.04
     and have their ears cleaned out,
},
{
    226.04,227.92
     they find that they really didn't have any earwax
},
{
    227.92,230.88
     in there at all, and it was just a middle ear issue.
},
{
    230.88,232.42
     The second thing that could be going on
},
{
    232.42,234.2
     is fluid in your middle ear space.
},
{
    234.2,236.44
     So instead of a negative middle ear pressure,
},
{
    236.44,238.08
     you actually have fluid inside of there
},
{
    238.08,240.2
     that is giving you that clogged up feeling.
},
{
    240.2,242.88
     Now every once in a while, that fluid will naturally
},
{
    242.88,248.4
     go away, sometimes doing those techniques that I described earlier will get that fluid to go back down
},
{
    248.4,250.88
     through your eustachian tube into your throat.
},
{
    250.88,254.78
     But every once in a while it requires the use of a pressure equalization tube that will
},
{
    254.78,258.8
     need to be put into your eardrum by an ear specialist.
},
{
    258.8,263.88
     And a third possible cause of your ears feeling clogged is sudden sensorineural hearing loss.
},
{
    263.88,268.82
     This generally happens in one ear versus the other and it is a much more serious medical
},
{
    268.82,272.74
     situation than those other two situations that I talked about.
},
{
    272.74,277.82
     It's actually required of you to go into a hearing care professional to get it diagnosed
},
{
    277.82,283.26
     and to receive treatment from an ear specialist in the form of steroids or even a steroid injection
},
{
    283.26,285.96
     through your eardrum to stop whatever is actually
},
{
    285.96,288.22
     attacking your hearing organ.
},
{
    288.22,290.16
     Treatment is extremely time sensitive
},
{
    290.16,291.9
     with sudden sensory neural hearing loss,
},
{
    291.9,294.04
     so if you try any of these other techniques
},
{
    294.04,296.4
     and they don't work, you need to immediately go in
},
{
    296.4,299.16
     and see an audiologist to get your hearing tested,
},
{
    299.16,301.76
     and if you have sustained a sudden sensory neural
},
{
    301.76,304.72
     hearing loss, you need to get treatment immediately.
},
{
    304.72,306.6
     It is never a good idea to just assume
},
{
    306.6,309.04
     that your clogged ears is due to something simple
},
{
    309.04,312.04
     like unequalized pressure in your middle ear space.
},
{
    312.04,314.32
     So if you try these techniques that I mentioned before
},
{
    314.32,315.84
     and you've tried to use Stacey
},
{
    315.84,317.54
     and that doesn't fix the problem,
},
{
    317.54,319.8
     you need to schedule an appointment with an audiologist
},
{
    319.8,321.2
     to get your hearing evaluated
},
{
    321.2,323.76
     to see what the problem really is.
},
{
    323.76,324.72
     That's it for this video.

    324.72,325.56
