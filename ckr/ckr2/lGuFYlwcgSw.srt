     In this video, let's go over how to get a deep butt stretch with two at-home exercises
},
{
    6.28,9.88
     that are literally going to kick glute pain in its butt.
},
{
    9.88,12.88
     Stay tuned.
},
{
    12.88,15.88
     Hey, everyone.
},
{
    15.88,19.2
     Dr. O here at SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan.
},
{
    19.2,24.76
     I'm going to show two variations of this glute or buttock stretch that's going to help just
},
{
    24.76,25.04
     get a very, very deep stretch in there. variations of this glute or buttock stretch that's going to help just give a
},
{
    25.04,30.56
     very, very deep stretch in there. So if you're looking to take it to the next
},
{
    30.56,35.36
     level, these are probably going to work for you. It doesn't require any special
},
{
    35.36,39.36
     equipment. You can do them at home. You probably could do them at work if you
},
{
    39.36,46.12
     find something high enough to be able to do the stretch. So the first one that we're going to do,
},
{
    46.12,47.92
     you can do standing.
},
{
    47.92,51.78
     And what you want to find is a flat surface
},
{
    51.78,53.96
     that is going to be a little bit elevated.
},
{
    53.96,57.2
     A bed is perfect, or if you have a small table,
},
{
    57.2,60.48
     that's gonna be pretty close to your hip level.
},
{
    60.48,62.16
     It's gonna work perfectly.
},
{
    62.16,64.32
     So what we're going to do is take the side
},
{
    64.32,70.68
     that we're looking to stretch and then place that leg up on that flat surface.
},
{
    70.68,75.54
     I pretty much have my knee at 90 degrees from the ankle to the knee should be a
},
{
    75.54,78.8
     straight line and then from the knee obviously to the hip is going to be a
},
{
    78.8,82.2
     straight line. What you're going to want to do is make sure that it's firmly
},
{
    82.2,91.42
     planted on that flat surface and you're going to take the other leg and go back with it until it feels like the knee and the hip
},
{
    91.42,92.42
     are in a straight line.
},
{
    92.42,96.88
     So you don't want to be rocked up and obviously you don't want to be rocked down.
},
{
    96.88,99.76
     So you want it nice and even.
},
{
    99.76,106.16
     From there what I'm going to do is straighten my back leg and then I'm going to slowly start to
},
{
    106.16,108.56
     hinge forward from the hips.
},
{
    108.56,110.64
     You don't want to round your back when you do this.
},
{
    110.64,115.12
     You want your back nice and straight and just slowly lean forward.
},
{
    115.12,121.48
     You are going to feel a great stretch right in the buttock area right here into that glute.
},
{
    121.48,130.44
     What you want to do is go to your comfort level and then hold that for about 15 seconds. Slowly come back up and then you're going to repeat
},
{
    130.44,136.24
     that process three to five times. I would recommend going to the other side to
},
{
    136.24,140.92
     make sure that the muscles are in balance even if it doesn't hurt. So if this
},
{
    140.92,148.18
     right here doesn't feel like it's enough of a stretch, let's make it even deeper.
},
{
    148.18,152.0
     So what we can do is hinge forward just a little bit.
},
{
    152.0,156.02
     And once you get to the point where it's a good stretch, put your arms out in front of
},
{
    156.02,157.38
     you straight like this.
},
{
    157.38,160.62
     And I'm telling you, this is going to be a deep butt stretch.
},
{
    160.62,162.42
     I can already feel it right now.
},
{
    162.42,165.76
     Again, hold that one for about 15 to, you
},
{
    165.76,169.84
     know, you can hold it up to 30 seconds if you want and then come back up slowly
},
{
    169.84,174.78
     and then repeat that three to five times. Another variation that you can try in
},
{
    174.78,180.84
     this position is to hinge forward and then slowly rotate the upper back. So I'm
},
{
    180.84,189.02
     going to go to my right a little bit and then I'm just going to slowly go towards my left. Experiment with that. You might find that it ends up
},
{
    189.02,194.34
     hitting that spot in the butt just a little bit better and at that point is
},
{
    194.34,198.98
     going to give you a better stretch. So give it a try. So this next one you can
},
{
    198.98,203.22
     do in bed on the floor with the yoga mat whatever feels more comfortable. You're
},
{
    203.22,206.3
     going to want to start pretty much on all fours.
},
{
    206.3,211.18
     The side of the buttock that you're looking to stretch, you're going to tuck that leg in
},
{
    211.18,214.18
     very similar to what we did with that first exercise.
},
{
    214.18,216.4
     So you want to kind of add a 90 degree angle.
},
{
    216.4,219.4
     This is going to be a modified pigeon pose.
},
{
    219.4,220.92
     It's a very popular yoga pose.
},
{
    220.92,223.92
     So if you've seen this before, that's probably why.
},
{
    223.92,230.8
     So what we're going to do is slowly take our body weight and slide back as far as we can. What you're
},
{
    230.8,235.16
     going to feel again is a great butt stretch going on and it's going to be
},
{
    235.16,241.34
     pretty deep. What I do is I try to hold this one for 15 to 30 seconds, relax, do
},
{
    241.34,244.84
     it three to five times, switch to the other side to make sure that we're also
},
{
    244.84,247.56
     showing that one a little bit of love too.
},
{
    247.56,252.84
     The second part of this to intensify the stretch is to go back to that starting position where
},
{
    252.84,255.24
     we have that very good butt stretch.
},
{
    255.24,262.12
     Then what I'm going to do is lean down on my forearm with the side opposite of the stretch
},
{
    262.12,265.36
     that I'm focusing on and then take my arm, straighten it,
},
{
    265.36,270.02
     and then kind of rotate the body up towards the ceiling.
},
{
    270.02,272.96
     So I'm taking my right arm right here,
},
{
    272.96,275.16
     keeping it straight, and going all the way up
},
{
    275.16,276.56
     towards the ceiling.
},
{
    276.56,279.04
     And it really gives you a very good stretch
},
{
    279.04,280.52
     into that glute and buttock.
},
{
    280.52,282.36
     Hold this one 15, 30 seconds.
},
{
    282.36,284.16
     Again, repeat three to five times.
},
{
    284.16,286.0
     Switch to the other side if you'd like.
},
{
    286.0,286.84
     Give it a try.
},
{
    286.84,288.6
     I hope it really does give you that bud stretch
},
{
    288.6,289.6
     that you're looking for.
