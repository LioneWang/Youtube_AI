     Hold it there for 10 seconds.
},

    39.12,41.28
     That's 10 seconds.
},
{
    41.28,43.2
     Always have an extra EpiPen ready

    43.2,44.96
     because the medicine can wear off.
},

    44.96,45.28
     Then call 911. Easy white. 10 seconds. Always have an extra EpiPen ready because the medicine can wear off.
},

    45.28,46.28
     Then call 911.

     Today, doctors are seeing more and more children with allergies, especially food allergies.
},
{
    55.44,60.4
     In a room of 20 kids, one or more of them will have allergies.
},
{
    60.4,70.0
     While most allergic reactions result in merely uncomfortable symptoms, some anaphylactic reactions may be more serious and even life-threatening.
},
{
    70.0,77.0
     About 150 children and young adults die from food allergies every year in the United States.
},
{
    77.0,87.0
     Due to the unpredictable nature of allergic reactions, over 2.4 million epinephrine auto-injectors, such as this, are currently being prescribed.
},
{
    87.0,94.0
     EpiPens deliver medicine quickly and effectively, but they only work if there is somebody around
},
{
    94.0,101.0
     who knows where the pen is, when to use it, how to use it, and will actually do it.
},
{
    101.0,106.24
     Times when you need to use an EpiPen can be stressful. It may even be life-threatening.
},
{
    106.24,111.36
     So it is important to have a plan of action so you can calmly react to the situation.
},
{
    112.08,117.44
     Knowing when to use a NEPI pen can be easy. If a child eats something their allergic to
},
{
    117.44,126.36
     has hives and is wheezing, give the shot. Sometimes, however, symptoms may not be as obvious. So if you are in doubt, always
},
{
    126.36,131.32
     give the shot. You may not even have known what the child has eaten. But if you do suspect
},
{
    131.32,137.2
     an allergic reaction or a child is demonstrating two or more symptoms, don't wait. The longer
},
{
    137.2,141.96
     you wait to administer an EpiPen, the harder it is to stop an allergic reaction, mild or
},
{
    141.96,147.84
     severe. And allergic reactions can change from mild to fatal quickly.
},
{
    147.84,151.46
     No child has ever died or has had serious problems
},
{
    151.46,153.36
     from a standard dose of epinephrine.
},
{
    153.36,156.82
     To protect the child in your life, be prepared.
},
{
    156.82,160.0
     Memorize these steps and practice them.
},
{
    160.0,162.34
     Review each child's action plan.
},
{
    162.34,165.06
     Know where each child's epiPen is located.
},
{
    166.12,168.12
     Epi equals 911.
},
{
    168.12,170.24
     If you get it, call it.
},
{
    170.24,172.58
     Take the EpiPen out of its case.
},
{
    172.58,175.24
     Hold it in a firm fist grip.
},
{
    175.24,176.84
     Remove the cap.
},
{
    176.84,180.08
     Make sure the child is sitting or lying down.
},
{
    180.08,182.44
     Identify the big muscle in the thigh.
},
{
    182.44,185.36
     Hold the leg and the child steadily.
},
{
    185.36,188.24
     Press the orange part firmly against the thigh
},
{
    188.24,189.76
     so that it clicks.
},
{
    189.76,190.84
     Stay there.
},
{
    190.84,192.12
     Don't bounce.
},
{
    192.12,194.08
     Hold for 10 seconds.
},
{
    194.08,196.44
     Press, click, and hold.
},
{
    196.44,198.8
     Some of you may have an epinephrine injector
},
{
    198.8,200.32
     that looks like this.
},
{
    200.32,202.6
     This training device has yellow caps,
},
{
    202.6,204.76
     but yours may have a different color.
},
{
    204.76,208.84
     This has the same medicine as the EpiPen, the same kind of spring-loaded needle,
},
{
    208.84,212.0
     and is used for exactly the same reasons.
},
{
    212.0,215.0
     This injector has two safety caps.
},
{
    215.0,217.0
     Hold the injector in a fiscret.
},
{
    217.0,220.0
     Don't put your thumb on either end.
},
{
    220.0,222.0
     Remove both safety caps.
},
{
    222.0,224.0
     The red end is the action end.
},
{
    224.0,225.1
     That's where the needle
},
{
    225.1,229.98
     comes out. Remember, red to the leg. The red end should not touch anything else.
},
{
    229.98,237.06
     Again, make sure the child is sitting or lying down and hold for 10 seconds. For
},
{
    237.06,241.96
     this device, the needle will remain exposed after use. Please put it down
},
{
    241.96,246.16
     carefully or put it back in the case. And if you haven't
},
{
    246.16,252.56
     done so already, call 911. As with any emergency medication or device, please be
},
{
    252.56,256.52
     familiar with it before you need to use it.
},
