     Hi, I'm Dr. Matthew Bose and welcome to our video series.

{
    23.0,25.0
     Proper therapy exercises are important for
},
{
    25.0,29.56
     recovery from most orthopedic conditions. I've designed this series to provide
},
{
    29.56,34.04
     you with up-to-date therapy regimens that you can access at home, in the gym, or
},
{
    34.04,67.0
     on the road. I hope you find these videos helpful and best of luck in your recovery. As soon as Gravity into full extension, nothing behind the knee.
},
{
    74.12,78.18
     We want to activate the muscles around the knee. These are quad sets. Tighten the muscle
},
{
    78.18,90.9
     and hold it for five seconds. The same thing was done with the calf muscles.
},
{
    90.9,95.86
     This also limits your chances of developing any blood clots as it mobilizes the veins
},
{
    95.86,102.84
     in the leg.
},
{
    102.84,106.72
     Here we're trying to tighten the muscles in back of the thigh, the hamstrings, similar
},
{
    106.72,109.2
     to the way we were doing the quadriceps.
},
{
    109.2,121.36
     It's just the early form of strengthening.
},
{
    121.36,126.24
     It's important to keep the mobility of the patella up, preventing scar tissue from forming,
},
{
    126.24,132.04
     which can be painful and can limit your knee bending and straightening after surgery.
},
{
    132.04,134.28
     Just push and hold the patella in various directions.
},
{
    134.28,140.08
     This may be a little sore and painful at first, but do it as tolerated.
},
{
    140.08,148.84
     We start strengthening by doing some general straight leg raises.
},
{
    148.84,154.4
     First out in front of your body.
},
{
    154.4,160.84
     Holding it for a few seconds at the top is helpful as well.
},
{
    160.84,171.72
     Next we work on the hip muscles doing a similar exercise lying on the side. Again, hold it for a second or two at the top of the exercise.
},
{
    171.72,173.2
     We start knee motion gently.
},
{
    173.2,207.16
     You can do sliding the heel along the help with the floor.
},
{
    209.4,217.04
     Slide it out straight. You can even use the opposite leg to help push the
},
{
    217.04,226.32
     operative leg down just gently and progressively. Another good way to do this is just with gravity.
},
{
    226.32,228.56
     Sit with your legs over the side of a table
},
{
    228.56,230.68
     and just with gravity let your foot fall down
},
{
    230.68,231.92
     towards the floor.
},
{
    231.92,233.68
     Again, you can use the opposite leg
},
{
    233.68,236.0
     to help increase the bending as well,
},
{
    236.0,239.04
     just gently pushing on the operative leg.
},
{
    241.68,243.36
     To regain straightening,
},
{
    243.36,244.88
     in addition to the heel props,
},
{
    244.88,247.2
     it's helpful to lay on your stomach
},
{
    247.2,250.36
     and let the heels just fall down over the edge of the table.
},
{
    250.36,254.72
     You can add ankle weights as well to increase the stress.
},
{
    254.72,260.08
     Trying to get your knee lock out fully straight.
},
{
    260.08,265.0
     We start regaining balance, sense right away after surgery.
},
{
    266.16,269.52
     These are some simple weight shifts, front and back,
},
{
    269.52,270.88
     and then side to side.
},
{
    271.76,276.8
     Start, people are at chair, you can go to progress,
},
{
    276.8,278.36
     to not hanging on at all.
},
{
    279.82,282.32
     And then do the exercise with your eyes closed.
},
{
    283.24,289.36
     And this will help regain your balance sense sense which can be disrupted by the surgery.
},
