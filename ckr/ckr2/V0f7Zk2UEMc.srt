     Bob and Brad the two most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    9.6,13.2
     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist, Brad Heineck physical therapist, together we
},
{
    13.2,16.24
     are the most famous physical therapists on the internet and our opinion of course Bob
},
{
    16.24,19.68
     Hey Brad we're gonna talk about how to restore your bad neck curve with a simple towel
},
{
    19.68,24.48
     stretching, we're also going to talk about why you want to restore it, right and why you get
},
{
    24.48,27.98
     that curve possibly and what can influence it just from day to day
},
{
    28.46,31.22
     Work and activity, sure and stresses, but
},
{
    32.58,35.6

     We're gonna look like this face right here sad, but if you like us we're gonna look like this
},
{
    51.94,55.24
     Look how that worked out Brad. What are we doing with this thing Bob?
},
{
    55.24,60.48
     This is I think is always a wonderful demonstration of distresses on your neck, right?
},
{
    61.12,70.32
     The simple activities such as working at the computer driving your car You know watching a movie at your coach. Yeah, because a bowling ball weighs about well some of them
},
{
    70.32,73.32
     I think they run from about 10 pounds to 16 pounds
},
{
    73.32,76.44
     Sure, yeah, I'm not a bowler. And your head is about 10 pounds
},
{
    76.44,79.76
     Yeah, mine's a little bigger now. Yeah, you got all that brain that you have to put in there
},
{
    79.76,81.76
     I don't know if it's brains what's on them there
},
{
    81.76,83.76
     It's loaded with something, right
},
{
    84.32,91.24
     So anyway that ball on top of your spine puts a lot of stress on it.
},
{
    91.24,93.7
     Right, you get that mass of all that intelligence and
},
{
    94.36,100.66
     there's that weight there and something has to hold it up and it's the spine and then the neck muscles around it.
},
{
    100.66,105.22
     So what you want to show first Brad? Well, let's say we are sitting
},
{
    105.82,114.0
     Right, with your cell phone or at a computer and your head is going forward like this and that way your head takes a
},
{
    114.16,117.08
     Fair amount of energy to stay forward ahead like this, right
},
{
    117.4,123.76
     So the formula is basically every inch you go forward that's another 10 pounds of stress on your neck
},
{
    123.74,127.08
     every inch you go forward that's another 10 pounds of stress on your neck Right, it doesn't mean your head is gaining 10 pounds
},
{
    127.08,131.88
     But the physics of it the leverage of your head being on this for example
},
{
    131.88,135.94
     That's the whole deal with this Bob is it easy to hold it here?
},
{
    136.18,139.26
     Okay, so right now yeah, it's lined up
},
{
    139.34,142.14
     You know this would be my ears are right over my shoulders
},
{
    142.14,147.64
     They're looking at the profile if I start going head forward like look at this Brad, I can even hold this with one hand. Sure
},
{
    147.64,150.62
     You know the muscles don't have to work that hard
},
{
    150.62,155.88
     And if I go forward, all right now there's a little bit of stress on my wrists
},
{
    155.88,160.12
     And you know imagine this stress for hours because this is what people do
},
{
    160.12,165.14
     Right so if I'm looking at my cell phone, I got about the same angle as this, take this hand off of there Bob
},
{
    165.14,172.18
     I told it that it's much heavier because of the angle and the physics of it
},
{
    172.18,174.5
     And so let's say you're way forward like this
},
{
    174.9,179.1
     And these are people I see going down like this looking at their cell phone
},
{
    179.82,186.0
     Now I mean my hands are fatiguing, so I mean this is always a great demonstration
},
{
    186.0,191.16
     And we want to take again take that smile that looks like that frown and turn it upside down
},
{
    191.16,193.16
     There you go, that's cute
},
{
    193.32,198.76
     Yeah, all right, so let's get rid of this, so if we look at the neck itself and the head would be here
},
{
    198.84,200.52
     Here's our spine
},
{
    200.52,205.72
     That bad neck curve that we have in the title of this is this, putting an awful
},
{
    205.72,211.72
     lot of stress on the spine itself and it's not so much the vertebra that causes
},
{
    211.72,216.12
     the problems, it's the discs between the vertebra and it can pinch the nerves that
},
{
    216.12,218.8
     come out which eventually into the shoulder and into the arm so you can
},
{
    218.8,222.8
     get pain in the neck and it refers down to the arm and all the way into the hand.
},
{
    222.8,225.52
     Also with this it's not just the arm and all the way into the hand. Also with this, it's not just the spine,
},
{
    225.52,228.76
     but there are muscles, particularly the scalene muscles
},
{
    228.76,230.64
     that are right in here and there,
},
{
    230.64,232.68
     they help hold your head up.
},
{
    232.68,234.44
     When you go forward, they tighten up,
},
{
    234.44,236.0
     they're part of the muscles that are holding your head
},
{
    236.0,238.04
     from flopping down like this.
},
{
    238.04,241.56
     And they can actually pinch the artery,
},
{
    241.56,243.48
     the vein and the nerve complex
},
{
    243.48,245.1
     and not only irritate the nerve
},
{
    245.1,251.12
     But can restrict the blood flow going down into the arm and that's why you start getting those sensations into your arm
},
{
    251.12,257.98
     And sometimes they're very strange sensations aren't they you know they might be like numbness and tingling and sometimes you do get different
},
{
    258.92,263.54
     Sensitivity to temperatures, sure exactly so now there's more Bob, but wait
},
{
    265.2,268.0
     There is more, I always like saying that So now there's more Bob, but wait There is more. I always like saying that, but wait there's more
},
{
    268.64,273.32
     But TMJ problems with the jaw with your head forward like this. Yeah, crazy
},
{
    273.32,278.16
     And that's very easy to relate to Brad because just try to swallow with your head like this
},
{
    278.16,281.92
     Right and now try to swallow with your head lined up correctly
},
{
    281.92,285.72
     Right, it should be so and you'll find out that there's a great difference
},
{
    285.72,290.16
     And if you eat like that with your head forward you are eventually going to could develop
},
{
    290.28,295.94
     You know problems with your jaw. Right that TMJ issues. It's not lined up. The other thing
},
{
    295.94,300.04
     I'd like to bring up Brad is that when your head is like this now this part is forward
},
{
    300.12,304.08
     This part is extended and this is where you can get tension in here
},
{
    304.08,306.94
     Right right up in that upper cervical area and
},
{
    306.94,312.08
     that results in the headaches. So if you're getting headaches that feel like they're coming from your neck and
},
{
    312.16,317.64
     they're going up a lot of times they're one-sided, they're going up one side of the head and maybe you've into the eye
},
{
    318.08,323.8
     That is the greater occipital nerve you're putting pressure on so that's another reason why the posture
},
{
    323.8,326.26
     a bad neck curve can result in pain
},
{
    326.26,329.26
     So how are we gonna take care of this? It can be very simple
},
{
    329.26,334.06
     You can you know grab a towel you know just go to the bathroom grab a towel in the kitchen or wherever
},
{
    334.5,336.5
     You also can use that this
},
{
    338.02,341.54
     Okay, I'm gonna get a chair because this is best done in a chair. I agree
},
{
    342.86,344.86
     I'm gonna use a stool here
},
{
    349.8,353.4
     best done in a chair. I agree. I'm gonna use a stool here. I should have probably been prepared. I don't see our stretch out strap right off at hand here. It's right
},
{
    353.4,357.28
     down there Bob. It's on our shelf displayed to everyone on the
},
{
    357.28,365.4
     floor. Then front Bob. Wow. Have a seat Bob
},
{
    366.48,370.16
     Okay Am I using this or am I using a towel? Probably should use a towel because we said a towel
},
{
    370.16,372.66
     Right, so okay
},
{
    372.66,377.12
     So before you get to the towel you do a very simple little stretch warm-up
},
{
    377.12,379.08
     Our chin touch. Always the chin touch
},
{
    379.08,383.12
     And you know while you're getting your towel prepared you can do a few chin tucks
},
{
    383.12,388.0
     The other thing when you're doing the chin tucks You already want to make sure you're in good posture. I don't want you going down here
},
{
    388.0,390.26
     Right. I mean your shoulders got to be up
},
{
    390.26,394.3
     You know they're lined up over the hips your ears are lined up with the shoulders
},
{
    394.3,398.66
     Yeah, so everything is a nice line there. Everything's lined up
},
{
    400.54,405.4
     Okay, all right we got the towel. Now there's two ways you can use this towel Bob
},
{
    405.64,411.4
     You show them your way and I'll show them my way. Mine I use the edge of the towel called the Selfage
},
{
    411.72,415.9
     Selfage, yeah, we usually have someone correct this on the comments
},
{
    416.08,418.62
     So and I go like this and I actually
},
{
    419.28,424.2
     Use that edge right underneath my ears or I can move up and down the spine as needed
},
{
    424.84,428.3
     With some people it might be more comfortable, I take a tongue, do the
},
{
    428.3,431.46
     corners and I roll it around like this and you get a little more padding this
},
{
    431.46,435.78
     way because sometimes that would get real specific, I would the self-edges too
},
{
    435.78,440.94
     aggressive and you'll know. But here it does work best to have a chair
},
{
    440.94,448.44
     that you can lean against like Bob have. You can do it without it but it's more comfortable with. In other words you can do it standing
},
{
    448.44,452.32
     or sitting but it is more comfortable sitting. Right, something to relax your
},
{
    452.32,457.76
     back. Go ahead Bob. So on this one the difference is I know I got it like
},
{
    457.76,462.08
     right below my ears as you can see lined up here I got the edge there I'm
},
{
    462.08,465.6
     gonna actually when I bring my neck back my hands go up with it
},
{
    465.6,470.96
     Right so a lot of times we say we even make little bunny ears we call it like this Brad
},
{
    470.96,475.52
     And then we follow the bunny ears or the bunny ears follow you
},
{
    475.52,480.28
     Right I never say that to my patients but Bob does I got a different one
},
{
    481.12,483.12
     I'm a lot more fun apparently
},
{
    483.84,485.72
     Okay Brad why don't you show your direction?
},
{
    485.72,491.52
     So with this a lot of times I'll have people just start here and you know if
},
{
    491.52,496.04
     they can go back like this and correct that curve and go back and relax and
},
{
    496.04,500.72
     this is for people that now you're pulling down. Yeah I'm pulling gently and
},
{
    500.72,506.3
     you can also go up with this as well and pulling up gently so I'm
},
{
    506.3,510.22
     pulling up towards the ceiling right now and whether you're doing either one
},
{
    510.22,515.18
     this should feel good like a good stretch on your neck it should not no pain no
},
{
    515.18,520.58
     gain this is you want to actually normally less pain right I mean if it
},
{
    520.58,524.38
     if it still hurts when you're doing this you might have to make adjustments like
},
{
    524.38,525.32
     if you're doing this one you might try make adjustments like if you're doing this one
},
{
    525.4,527.4
     You might try a little lower
},
{
    527.4,530.62
     Right and go down a little bit lower and give it a try
},
{
    531.96,533.96
     My neck just cracked a little bit right?
},
{
    533.96,540.56
     Right, a little cavitation for Christmas. Oh that's how I got my Christmas tie-in. It is a few days before Christmas
},
{
    540.56,544.32
     Yeah, yeah, they're singish. Maybe we should sing
},
{
    544.32,545.0
     No we should sing
},
{
    545.0,548.0
     That's pretty much a given
},
{
    548.0,551.0
     Anything else Brad, you want to show them?
},
{
    551.0,559.0
     No, well we can, if you do happen to have the strap, the nice thing about the strap is it has the loops
},
{
    559.0,569.12
     And that way if you have arthritic hands and you have a hard time grasping that towel You know you can get your hands in here and get your thumb in there or you can grab it like this
},
{
    569.76,571.76
     And here I'm gonna go down
},
{
    573.44,579.64
     Every six inches there's a loop so it makes it very versatile and then you can you can say I can start low
},
{
    580.2,586.32
     And go like this. That actually works out good because there's a lot of people that don't like the pain at C7
},
{
    586.32,591.28
     So this is actually a great way to really kind of get focused on that area where you can't really with a towel
},
{
    591.28,594.04
     And you wouldn't do it with a shirt and tie on like this
},
{
    594.04,598.98
     You got to have a t-shirt on where you get the because this canvas type material actually grips
},
{
    598.98,604.4
     Yeah, it kind of grips on the body. Yeah, it would like that. Wow. I just that's cool, Brad
},
{
    604.4,607.4
     I didn't even realize that. Well we learned something new every day.
},
{
    607.4,611.76
     Yeah. Oh my goodness. Can I try that one? Yeah, go ahead give it a whirl.
},
{
    611.76,616.02
     One thing that I found out by starting to use the stretch out strap which really did,
},
{
    616.02,618.78
     I know you always talked about you know if you have arthritic hands and stuff,
},
{
    618.78,623.68
     but even when I'm stretching my hamstrings, I put my hands in that loop and it's just relaxing.
},
{
    623.68,625.68
     I don't you know I'm not pulling, I'm just
},
{
    625.68,630.76
     playing there and kind of letting gravity do its thing, and that's the key to stretching is learning
},
{
    630.76,636.76
     how to relax and breathe and let your body stretch, don't force it. So this is a new discovery,
},
{
    636.76,642.72
     Brad, I think because it's really hard to get down to that lower spine, right in here, wow,
},
{
    642.72,647.62
     that is cool, now you can see that, it kind of grips in there. You better believe it's
},
{
    647.62,653.24
     gripping. Wow. So that's like if you're getting that kind of knots in that upper area there, you can use it for that too.
},
{
    653.24,661.64
     You get to the upper thrast a little bit. Wonderful. Okay, well once again we've discovered that. I'm thinking we're getting close to that one big discovery we're working on.
},
{
    661.64,671.12
     We can fix just about anything. Except for a broken heart. There you go. Is it right in here Bob? We work hard every day to do it. I don't know it's over here somewhere. Thanks for watching
},
