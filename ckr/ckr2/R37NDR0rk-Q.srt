     Hey everybody, it's Doctor Jo and today I'm going to talk about muscle soreness and ways
},
{
    4.12,5.12
     to relieve it.
},
{
    5.12,6.12
     So let's get started.
},
{
    6.12,11.68
     Disclaimer alert, disclaimer alert.
},
{
    11.68,15.08
     All of you have probably heard of muscle soreness in general.
},
{
    15.08,19.52
     The technical term is DOMS, which is a delayed onset of muscle soreness.
},
{
    19.52,24.02
     And so if you've ever overworked out, you really know what muscle soreness or that delayed
},
{
    24.02,29.48
     onset of muscle soreness is all about. A lot of times with doms you don't feel it until
},
{
    29.48,34.36
     the first 24 or 48 hours and a lot of times when you overdo it more it takes
},
{
    34.36,37.88
     a little bit longer to set in but you know what it feels like it's kind of
},
{
    37.88,42.08
     like oh my goodness I did way too much and the the tough part of that is
},
{
    42.08,50.72
     sometimes you don't feel like you're doing too much and then you feel it later. So that domes delay onset of muscle soreness is basically you're just doing
},
{
    50.72,55.44
     little micro tears in the muscle and this is actually a good thing this is how you build muscle
},
{
    55.44,61.6
     but sometimes if you do too much those microfiber tears are a little bit bigger and it just takes
},
{
    61.6,69.48
     longer to recover and it's really sore. So a great way to help get rid of muscle soreness is to use kind of a
},
{
    69.48,74.8
     massager or vibration kind of therapy and that really helps relax those muscles
},
{
    74.8,79.36
     and helps them recover. And so the folks at Massage Therapy Concepts sent me their
},
{
    79.36,84.48
     cordless handheld massager. And so this is a really really cool piece of
},
{
    84.48,85.88
     equipment because it
},
{
    85.88,91.44
     has a bunch of different knobs that you can use to get different settings and use it in
},
{
    91.44,96.12
     different places. The big thing when you get this is to make sure there's a little piece
},
{
    96.12,101.8
     right here where you charge it and take that out. Otherwise, this doesn't work. But it's
},
{
    101.8,105.32
     really cool. It's a nice solid equipment that you can use
},
{
    105.32,106.2
     and it's cordless.
},
{
    106.2,107.68
     So a lot of times, you know,
},
{
    107.68,110.24
     if things are cordless, they're not super powerful,
},
{
    110.24,112.72
     but this is a really good powerful massager.
},
{
    112.72,115.72
     And when you have that muscle soreness, that tightness,
},
{
    115.72,117.24
     cause everything's kind of tightened up
},
{
    117.24,119.96
     because it's hurting, doing massage on it
},
{
    119.96,123.2
     with the vibration type therapy is really, really helpful.
},
{
    123.2,127.08
     So it comes with seven different attachments
},
{
    127.08,130.0
     that you can use and it has a whole bunch of different ways
},
{
    130.0,130.84
     that you can use it.
},
{
    130.84,133.32
     So the first one is just the air cushion.
},
{
    133.32,138.04
     And this does a really good job of knee, wrist, ankles,
},
{
    138.04,139.28
     and the joint areas.
},
{
    139.28,141.36
     And so that's why it's kind of an air cushion.
},
{
    141.36,143.04
     So if you're going over a joint, sometimes
},
{
    143.04,144.48
     if you've ever used a massager over a joint,
},
{
    144.48,145.3
     it kind of bumps over. But the air cushion does a really good job of an air cushion. So if you're going over a joint, sometimes if you've ever used a massager over a joint, it kind of bumps over.
},
{
    145.5,148.8
     But the air cushion does a really good job of not doing that.
},
{
    148.8,150.7
     And so they just pop on really easily.
},
{
    150.7,153.1
     You can see that that is, it's easy to use.
},
{
    153.4,156.0
     The next one is the point attachment.
},
{
    156.0,159.7
     And this one's a little bit more for something like reflexology on the
},
{
    159.7,161.5
     foot or acupuncture type thing.
},
{
    161.5,165.2
     So if you've got like a trigger point in there, this does a really good
},
{
    165.2,172.48
     job of whoops getting to that spot and making it really kind of relaxed with that massage. Then you
},
{
    172.48,178.48
     also have the six head attachment which is basically kind of for the back, the thighs, a more general
},
{
    178.48,183.36
     area. And you can see these little knobs here. They've got some little pressure spots. And so it
},
{
    183.36,188.32
     does a really good job of just kind of relaxing those bigger areas and it does great.
},
{
    188.32,194.88
     And they also have a scalp attachment so if you have you know some kind of pain
},
{
    194.88,199.08
     some tension going on and you really want to get over like the head area you
},
{
    199.08,202.04
     can see these little pieces there they're kind of soft so it doesn't get
},
{
    202.04,205.52
     caught up in your hair and it's really nice and relaxing as well.
},
{
    205.52,211.3
     They also have just a general body one and this one, like you do it directly on the skin
},
{
    211.3,215.92
     and you put some gel on it to make it nice and smooth so it kind of gets the whole body.
},
{
    215.92,220.4
     And then there's also a facial one, same thing you'd want to use some facial cream or something
},
{
    220.4,224.56
     for this one but you know a lot of times just kind of getting in this area, maybe in the
},
{
    224.56,226.66
     jaw area and things when you have some tension this
},
{
    226.66,232.6
     helps relax it as well. And then the final one is their forehead attachment, not
},
{
    232.6,236.86
     forehead, foreheads. And what it is really great for is you can see there's a
},
{
    236.86,240.18
     little space in between so like the back going down the back so then it's not
},
{
    240.18,244.42
     right on your spine but it gets those muscles around the end. So it's really
},
{
    244.42,248.18
     nice because you have all these different options. They're really easy just to put
},
{
    248.18,251.8
     on and then take back off. So if you want to do different spots and then you can
},
{
    251.8,256.2
     see here where you can adjust it. So it does a really good job again of these
},
{
    256.2,261.2
     tight muscles. This muscle soreness getting those the doms out of there. And
},
{
    261.2,265.12
     so you can see here you just turn it on and you can start off
},
{
    265.12,270.92
     slow if I was just kind of going in here kind of working it around and then you can even
},
{
    270.92,276.72
     take it all the way up where it gets a little bit higher. And so it's you know almost like
},
{
    276.72,281.56
     somebody's giving you a massage so it's a nice way to be able to massage yourself and
},
{
    281.56,285.44
     then as you can see with a nice handle you can go you know
},
{
    285.44,289.6
     all the way around in your back and stuff you can kind of turn it this way
},
{
    289.6,294.2
     and get the area so it has a nice long handle where you can get a lot of
},
{
    294.2,298.0
     different areas of your body without having to reach really hard and move
},
{
    298.0,300.96
     your body and hurt it. So if you're interested in purchasing the cordless
},
{
    300.96,308.0
     handheld massager make sure and click on the link up there. So after you kind of massage everything out, get that good vibration to make those muscles
},
{
    308.0,309.28
     relax a little bit.
},
{
    309.28,311.36
     You want to do gentle stretches.
},
{
    311.36,315.04
     Sometimes it's tough because when those muscles are tight, it hurts a little bit.
},
{
    315.04,319.64
     A lot of times, especially the calves when they get really tight, it's really important
},
{
    319.64,321.08
     to gently stretch it out.
},
{
    321.08,328.54
     You're not trying to crank on the muscles But you want to stretch them out because once you get them to relax again with you know that massage therapy
},
{
    328.54,333.16
     You want to lengthen back out those muscles because with those little micro tears in there
},
{
    333.16,337.96
     If it stays tight and they heal in that position then it sometimes causes problems
},
{
    337.96,340.0
     So you want you don't want to force the stretch
},
{
    340.0,343.8
     But you want a nice gentle stretch to kind of lay back out those muscle fibers
},
{
    343.8,349.52
     So when they heal they're nice and flat and they're not up like that that causes problems. So just some gentle
},
{
    349.52,353.28
     stretches if you have a specific area make sure and check out some of my other videos because I've
},
{
    353.28,358.48
     got all the different body parts to be able to stretch those out. Also what's super important
},
{
    358.48,362.72
     is to drink plenty of water after you've got that muscle sorbitus. You know you want to keep your
},
{
    362.72,366.76
     body hydrated a lot of times all the fluid goes in
},
{
    366.76,368.02
     to kind of help protect the area,
},
{
    368.02,369.72
     so sometimes you feel very dehydrated.
},
{
    369.72,371.6
     So if you're drinking plenty of water,
},
{
    371.6,374.56
     throughout the day, not just gulping it down at one time,
},
{
    374.56,376.04
     but make sure you're spreading it out,
},
{
    376.04,378.44
     that really helps with that muscle soreness as well.
},
{
    378.44,382.16
     And then the final one is really just to get good sleep.
},
{
    382.16,383.24
     Get some plenty of sleep,
},
{
    383.24,385.78
     because our bodies truly heal
},
{
    385.78,389.74
     when we're sleeping. That's when all those little cells go in and take all the
},
{
    389.74,393.46
     bad cells out and then put all the new cells back in. So if you're getting a
},
{
    393.46,396.92
     good night's sleep, that's really going to help that healing process. So make
},
{
    396.92,400.9
     sure and follow all those steps. That that domes is sometimes really painful.
},
{
    400.9,404.9
     It's not the worst thing in the world, but you really need to do all those things
},
{
    404.9,407.44
     to help make sure that you're healing that muscle
},
{
    407.44,411.36
     how it's supposed to and it's just not gonna stay knotted up. So if you're
},
{
    411.36,414.72
