     This video we're going to chat about a couple things to do for sports hernia as far as rehab
},
{
    8.88,9.88
     exercises.
},
{
    9.88,11.72
     So, what is a sports hernia?
},
{
    11.72,15.64
     Basically, a sports hernia is generally not what you typically think of a hernia.
},
{
    15.64,20.76
     It's generally going to be a tear or rupture of a tissue or a strain.
},
{
    20.76,26.72
     So what we generally see sports hernias and our athletes are where the oblique tissue and the rectus abdominis tissue
},
{
    26.76,32.16
     They come down and insert into the pubic bone at that same areas where our big strong
},
{
    32.52,36.22
     Adductor muscles insert into that same bone. So they often get into this tugging war
},
{
    36.68,41.92
     Eventually one of those fails and we start to get a tear rupture or injury to that tissue
},
{
    42.38,44.38
     Resulting in a sports hernia. So
},
{
    44.08,49.72
     or rupture or injury to that tissue resulting in a sports hernia. So one thing we want to really focus on with our athletes or patients that are experiencing
},
{
    49.72,54.84
     a sports hernia is one, developing more pelvic stability because the more stable the pelvis
},
{
    54.84,59.52
     is, the less I'm having to rely on some of these accessory tissues for stabilization.
},
{
    59.52,65.38
     We're going to work on properly activating the hip flexor muscles and also a little bit
},
{
    65.38,67.08
     of core strengthening.
},
{
    67.08,70.32
     So first thing I'm going to have Mitch do is he's going to lay down on the ground here
},
{
    70.32,73.72
     for me.
},
{
    73.72,76.66
     We're going to get a band that we anchor to the wall.
},
{
    76.66,78.88
     So here I'm going to hook this around his foot.
},
{
    78.88,82.8
     It's going to keep the toes dorsiflexed or pointed back towards him.
},
{
    82.8,85.76
     The key for this exercise is to start to
},
{
    85.76,89.48
     properly engage the hip flexor muscles. So what he's going to do is he's going to
},
{
    89.48,94.52
     keep his back flat against the ground. So core is going to be engaged and that
},
{
    94.52,99.02
     will help isolate the psoas or one of our main hip flexors. So what he's going
},
{
    99.02,108.02
     to do is he's going to pull this band in towards him, good, and then slowly extend that leg. So ideally on this
},
{
    108.02,113.18
     exercise is early in the rehab phase, I want to move slower in the extension phase
},
{
    113.18,118.06
     than I do in the flexion phase. One key thing is he doesn't want to lose the
},
{
    118.06,121.54
     activation of here, so once he feels his low back start to arch, he's going to
},
{
    121.54,129.72
     take a rest. Again, initially starting out, these exercises maybe perform six to eight repetitions.
},
{
    129.72,132.64
     I want quality over quantity.
},
{
    132.64,135.36
     And then he may work up to start to build some endurance in the core and in the hip
},
{
    135.36,136.36
     flexor.
},
{
    136.36,140.2
     So he may work into that three to four sets of 10 to 12 range.
},
{
    140.2,143.72
     Good, and he can relax there.
},
{
    143.72,148.76
     I'm going to grab a physio ball, and we're going to work on, again, kind of building
},
{
    148.76,152.44
     pelvic stability, some core and hip flexor engagement.
},
{
    152.44,157.22
     So what he's going to do is come into a dead bug position, where he's going to have alternating
},
{
    157.22,160.96
     hands, and he's going to hold this position.
},
{
    160.96,166.0
     And so we're getting a cross activation of oblique tissue and hip flexor on the other side.
},
{
    166.0,169.0
     And so what we'll do here is, we'll perform repetitions.
},
{
    169.0,175.0
     So what it'll do is it'll alternate, so he'll bring opposite hand, opposite foot, and he'll lower the other.
},
{
    175.0,178.0
     Again, same theme of keeping his back flat against the ground.
},
{
    178.0,182.0
     So we want to keep those anterior abdominals engaged.
},
{
    182.0,186.0
     And we'll go back and forth alternating right and left.
},
{
    189.76,194.56
     So here again early in the rehab phase we're starting in those lower repetitions maybe that three
},
{
    194.56,198.96
     two to three sets of six to eight repetitions working into those higher rep counts building
},
{
    198.96,205.04
     endurance and stability in this position and you may work into those three to four sets of eight to ten to twelve repetitions.
},
{
    206.24,211.92
     That's good Mitch. And lastly he's going to still stay on his back. Knees are going to be bent.
},
{
    211.92,215.36
     And we're going to do an isometric contraction of those adductors. So we still want to start to
},
{
    215.36,220.56
     engage those adductor muscles where they attach into the pelvis. And what we're going to do is we're
},
{
    220.56,229.62
     going to have Mitch lift off the ground so his hips are going to come up, which if he needs to he can come on to his heels which is going to
},
{
    229.62,232.26
     further engage that glute tissue.
},
{
    232.26,236.26
     The goal here is to keep the hips nice and stable.
},
{
    236.26,238.14
     So again we're working on that pelvic stability.
},
{
    238.14,242.7
     So what he's going to do is he's going to extend his left knee.
},
{
    242.7,244.38
     Good.
},
{
    244.38,245.68
     And then come back knee. Good. And then come back down.
},
{
    245.68,246.36
     Good.
},
{
    246.36,249.12
     Key here is when he extends this left knee,
},
{
    249.12,250.84
     this right glute has to kick in.
},
{
    250.84,253.84
     And what I don't want to see is I don't want to see this left hip drop.
},
{
    253.84,254.84
     So again, he's going to lift.
},
{
    254.84,257.28
     See how it wants to drop a little bit?
},
{
    257.28,259.92
     That means he's not engaging his right glute enough.
},
{
    259.92,262.0
     So again, focusing on squeezing his right glute,
},
{
    262.0,263.8
     this is going to stay nice and stationary,
},
{
    263.8,264.6
     and that's much better.
},
{
    264.6,267.12
     So working on that good pelvic stabilization.
},
{
    267.12,268.12
     Good.
},
{
    268.12,270.12
     Again, come back down.
},
{
    270.12,274.72
     And we can still work through that same rep scheme of two to three sets of six-date repetitions,
},
{
    274.72,277.88
     working up to those three to four sets of probably 10 to 12.
},
{
    277.88,282.36
     And these can be done in those early stages after a sports rehab to start to get the pelvic
},
{
    282.36,285.68
     muscles and the abdominals to start to work together.
},
{
    285.68,291.52
     Basically we're creating an area of more stability so we're not creating excess strain at that
},
{
    291.52,296.16
     pubic bone or those tissues that are getting too much load creating breakdown of the tendons
},
{
    296.16,297.32
     and even possible tears.
},
