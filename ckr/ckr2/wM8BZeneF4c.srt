{
    0.0,10.52
     So we're going to be demonstrating the big three, which are the three exercises that
},
{
    10.52,17.28
     we usually start, usually within a week of having an ACL reconstructive surgery.
},
{
    17.28,19.24
     The weight bearing restrictions are different for everybody.
},
{
    19.24,22.08
     In your case, they're going to be full weight bearing.
},
{
    22.08,24.78
     The weight bearing restrictions are different for everybody.
},
{
    24.78,28.28
     So the three exercises we do, the first one is really maintaining
},
{
    28.28,31.14
     the knee and extension because you want to make sure that you have good knee
},
{
    31.14,34.84
     extension and all this is said and done. So one of the purposes of
},
{
    34.84,37.8
     having the brace is to make sure this knee is straight. So what you're going to
},
{
    37.8,41.66
     do about five to ten minutes two to three times a day is you're going to work
},
{
    41.66,45.12
     on making sure that the back of the knee can actually touch the table.
},
{
    45.12,46.12
     Okay.
},
{
    46.12,47.12
     Just like we're doing right here.
},
{
    47.12,50.68
     So you're going to slowly let the knee hang backwards, let the back of the knee touch
},
{
    50.68,53.12
     the table, and make sure that this is straight.
},
{
    53.12,58.28
     Okay, you've got that already, and the great thing about having a brace is with the brace
},
{
    58.28,59.92
     you usually get that already.
},
{
    59.92,61.08
     That's number one.
},
{
    61.08,62.72
     Number two is getting the muscle contraction.
},
{
    62.72,65.28
     You want to sit up here just for a second?
},
{
    65.28,68.48
     And what we typically will do is we'll use the other side
},
{
    68.48,69.6
     as a template.
},
{
    69.6,71.96
     So you're gonna put your right hand on your right thigh,
},
{
    71.96,73.32
     left hand on your left thigh.
},
{
    73.32,74.56
     And if you try to make a contraction,
},
{
    74.56,77.4
     you're gonna see that it's not gonna be working very well
},
{
    77.4,78.82
     because it's been turned off.
},
{
    78.82,80.52
     So you wanna turn it back on
},
{
    80.52,81.8
     because getting this muscle turned on
},
{
    81.8,83.92
     is gonna be very important for your recovery.
},
{
    83.92,88.64
     So what you do is you use a biofeedback method by contracting one side and trying to contract
},
{
    88.64,90.94
     the other one at the same time.
},
{
    90.94,95.76
     By doing both of them at the same time, contract, release, contract, release, again, 5 to 10
},
{
    95.76,96.92
     minutes, 2 to 3 times a day.
},
{
    96.92,99.56
     By doing that, it will also help to kind of get that engaged.
},
{
    99.56,100.56
     Okay.
},
{
    100.56,101.96
     All right, so that's exercise number 2.
},
{
    101.96,103.24
     Exercise number 3 is a little bit tricky.
},
{
    103.24,105.32
     And to understand exercise number three,
},
{
    105.32,108.36
     we have to realize that when you put an ACL in
},
{
    108.36,110.2
     and you can track this muscle here,
},
{
    110.2,112.62
     then you're going to compress this tibia bone
},
{
    112.62,113.68
     in the right way.
},
{
    113.68,115.24
     You're gonna compress it.
},
{
    115.24,118.68
     If the leg is hanging over the table
},
{
    118.68,121.4
     and you try to straighten out your leg,
},
{
    121.4,124.72
     then the muscle forces of that quad muscle here
},
{
    124.72,125.36
     are gonna actually pull on the ACL graft. straighten out your leg, then the muscle forces of that quad muscle here are going to actually
},
{
    125.36,134.16
     pull on the ACL graft. That's not good, so we don't want that. So the third exercise
},
{
    134.16,137.76
     in the Big Three is going to be getting the knee bent, because ultimately you're going
},
{
    137.76,142.04
     to want that at some point in time. So what we do here is, rather than just grabbing the
},
{
    142.04,149.24
     knee up, which will pull on the ACL a bit as well too, you're going to learn how to bring the opposite leg under.
},
{
    149.24,150.24
     Under the ankle.
},
{
    150.24,153.44
     So what you want to do is not do what you're just about to do.
},
{
    153.44,155.36
     Our ACL is sitting right in here.
},
{
    155.36,158.04
     And so what you don't want to do is put any forces behind the leg here.
},
{
    158.04,161.48
     So you want to make sure that you or a family member doesn't grab the leg like that underneath
},
{
    161.48,162.48
     the calf.
},
{
    162.48,163.48
     You want to grab it down towards the ankle.
},
{
    163.48,166.48
     So bring this foot down towards the ankle. Then you want to learn to very
},
{
    166.48,170.8
     gently bring it over the side of the table, slowly over the side of the table.
},
{
    171.92,180.4
     Now what you're going to do is come forward just a little bit. Okay, now you're going to
},
{
    180.4,187.1
     gradually let it relax. Now it's okay to make a muscle to pull this downward. So active bending is okay,
},
{
    187.1,189.08
     but you're gonna see when we bring it out the other way,
},
{
    189.08,191.9
     we don't wanna do any active extension
},
{
    191.9,193.04
     because of what I mentioned to you.
},
{
    193.04,195.32
     So as you're seeing, you're gonna slowly bend it
},
{
    195.32,198.54
     and our goals for ACL reconstruction are,
},
{
    198.54,201.72
     in week one, you wanna get about 30 degrees,
},
{
    201.72,202.88
     right about what you've gotten.
},
{
    202.88,205.76
     The purpose of going super slow with our program
},
{
    205.76,211.6
     is realizing that the graft is under a lot of biological chaos in the first couple of weeks.
},
{
    211.6,218.08
     And what we see is that if you move it very aggressively in the first few weeks, then you may
},
{
    218.08,223.28
     be changing the environment and you may be altering the biology of how the healing occurs. We don't
},
{
    223.28,229.6
     really know this, but I've found that if you go a little slower, you allow that biology to work and you don't lose
},
{
    229.6,234.24
     your motion by this program as well too. So you're supposed to be getting 30 degrees in the first week,
},
{
    234.8,239.28
     60 degrees by week two, and between weeks three and four you want to slowly get up to 90 degrees.
},
{
    239.28,243.2
     You're almost at the beginning of week two, so you can slowly and gradually bring that to 60.
},
{
    243.2,250.68
     So again, active flexion is okay as you're bending it. Active bending is okay. Active bending is okay because
},
{
    250.68,254.76
     that's actually pulling the leg backwards and it's protective of the ACL. And when you're
},
{
    254.76,258.08
     done with that, what you're going to find is instead of just kicking that out, which
},
{
    258.08,263.04
     again you don't want to do, in this position the muscles of the quad are attached to the
},
{
    263.04,266.58
     front of the tibia and they will actually tug on the ACL if you do that.
},
{
    266.58,272.9
     So you want to use this assisted device right here, your leg, behind the ankle and gradually
},
{
    272.9,274.26
     bring that exactly.
},
{
    274.26,275.26
     Perfect.
},
{
    275.26,277.76
     And then when you're done with that, so you do that again five to ten minutes, two, three
},
{
    277.76,278.76
     times a day.
},
{
    278.76,280.38
     That's that third part of the big three.
},
{
    280.38,281.82
     Come down again one more time.
},
{
    281.82,283.22
     Nice and easy.
},
{
    283.22,284.46
     Nice and easy.
},
{
    284.46,285.6
     Nice and easy. nice and slow.
},
{
    285.6,287.8
     You don't have to do these in a very aggressive way.
},
{
    287.8,289.8
     And that's almost about 40 degrees yourself.
},
{
    289.8,291.6
     That's perfect for the first week.
},
{
    291.6,293.1
     And bring that out a little bit.
},
{
    293.1,294.7
     And you're getting it really, really easily.
},
{
    294.7,298.1
     So again, we find that there are two different types of issues
},
{
    298.1,298.6
     that we see.
},
{
    298.6,300.1
     Now you can bring that over to the side.
},
{
    300.1,303.1
     One of the issues we see is that person who really gets the motion
},
{
    303.1,304.3
     super easy.
},
{
    304.3,308.0
     That may be someone who's actually taking a little bit of time to heal,
},
{
    308.0,310.0
     and that's a perfect reason why this program is there.
},
{
    310.0,312.0
     They go nice and slow to let the biology set up.
},
{
    312.0,315.0
     And there are those that are really, really stiff at the beginning.
},
{
    315.0,317.0
     Those people are probably forming a lot of scar.
},
{
    317.0,320.0
     When you're forming a lot of scar, you may be somebody we have to push a little bit faster.
},
{
    320.0,324.0
     If you can't get those motion criteria that we've just discussed,
},
{
    324.0,329.42
     we'll often start rehab at that time too. With the brace over here, this brace is going
},
{
    329.42,332.96
     to be on for a total of about four weeks and so we use the brace to assist
},
{
    332.96,337.86
     walking and depending on what your weight bearing restrictions are, in your
},
{
    337.86,341.94
     case we're gonna have you put about 50% of your body weight on it. But in
},
{
    341.94,345.06
     many cases and those that have had minutes because repairs will actually just do
},
{
    345.06,346.64
     what we call toe touch weight bearing.
},
{
    346.64,348.16
     So that's something we have to discuss in person,
},
{
    348.16,349.92
     but other than that, the brace stays on in extension
},
{
    349.92,352.32
     for about four weeks, and at the end of the four weeks,
},
{
    352.32,353.92
     we can progress from there.
},
