{
    0.0,10.0
     So we sound like we're friends.
},
{
    10.0,11.0
     Okay.
},
{
    11.0,17.0
     All right, so tell us how awesome you're doing now.
},
{
    17.0,21.0
     Well, I have no sciatic pain anymore.
},
{
    21.0,26.44
     I had burning in my legs, but it's all gone away and I'm able to
},
{
    26.44,30.64
     stand and walk more than I did before I started here.
},
{
    30.64,34.84
     And what when you started here you were carrying something and we don't see it
},
{
    34.84,39.68
     here today. I was walking with a cane. Yeah that's pretty cool huh? Yeah very cool.
},
{
    39.68,44.36
     So I'm gonna say what your symptoms were that I found was that you were getting
},
{
    44.36,45.38
     the burning in your quad. found was that you were getting the burning in your quad
},
{
    46.14,51.44
     She was getting you were getting left sacrilegia joint pain up here. Actually, how's that doing?
},
{
    55.08,57.42
     The right leg feels like a little cramp and
},
{
    58.24,63.1
     So past history so the what you were dealing with here is rheumatoid arthritis
},
{
    63.94,68.52
     Crohn's Parkinson's's, type 2 diabetes,
},
{
    68.52,70.52
     sleep apnea.
},
{
    70.52,75.36
     Now have any of those felt different?
},
{
    75.36,77.12
     I sleep better.
},
{
    77.12,78.12
     Sleeping better.
},
{
    78.12,81.28
     And that's actually a common thing is when you have this burning in your thigh and back
},
{
    81.28,84.28
     pain, it's very difficult to sleep.
},
{
    84.28,86.64
     So and it's only been two weeks.
},
{
    86.64,88.48
     Just wait, right?
},
{
    88.48,92.08
     So we're gonna show how we do the treatment on you.
},
{
    92.08,92.92
     Okay.
},
{
    92.92,94.52
     So let's have your glasses
},
{
    94.52,97.02
     and we'll put your glasses over here
},
{
    97.02,99.12
     and go ahead and lie down on your stomach.
},
{
    113.64,120.72
     Okay, so when I'm analyzing her spine, what I notice is one side hikes up a lot higher than the other, and then her spine does kind of a standard scoliotic curve of which it
},
{
    120.72,128.6
     goes this way, comes around over here on the left side, and that's pretty standard for the, I'm going to say, 9 out of 10 scoliosis.
},
{
    128.6,140.3
     So what I'm going to do is I'm going to first use a block to place underneath her pelvis, and that helps preset everything so when I do the adjustment.
},
{
    140.3,147.8
     And because of all her different conditions, we use an arthur stem because it's a lot more gentle and we've done this about six times already
},
{
    147.8,151.96
     So I know where I'm going with this. I'm going to go to the areas where we do the adjustments
},
{
    160.24,168.28
     And this is relatively pain-free right yes when I'm doing. Of course we have to say that it's on the video.
},
{
    168.28,169.04
     Right?
},
{
    169.04,170.0
     As you're gritting your teeth.
},
{
    174.0,175.48
     Well, it's painless for me anyway.
},
{
    184.16,192.6
     But that burning sensation that is no longer there indicates that the nerve is not being
},
{
    192.6,202.48
     bothered anymore when it comes out of your lower back.
},
{
    202.48,206.68
     And so the next phase that we're going to do with treatment for you is we want you to
},
{
    206.68,211.96
     do that swimming, it's called the twinges and the hinges for people that have rheumatoid
},
{
    211.96,215.16
     arthritis here in our community.
},
{
    215.16,220.64
     And they have a swim class where they can work out in a very warm pool.
},
{
    220.64,228.0
     And then I'm going to show you exercise to do that'll only take about five minutes or so per day.
},
{
    228.0,233.0
     And we'll start doing that pretty soon once this starts to derotate.
},
{
    235.0,238.0
     So it's fun to have success, right?
},
{
    238.0,240.0
     It's wonderful.
},
