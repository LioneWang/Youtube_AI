},
{
    61.16,62.72
     There you go.
},
{
    62.72,63.56
     Biceps.
},
{
    63.56,66.28
     We're gonna talk about that, you know, the muscle right there,
},
{
    66.28,68.56
     the ones that the guys are always trying to build up
},
{
    68.56,69.88
     for the girls, you know.
},
{
    69.88,72.2
     Yeah, but we never did, of course.
},
{
    72.2,73.92
     No, because we don't have them.
},
{
    73.92,75.32
     Yeah.
},
{
    75.32,77.04
     We already got good girls.
},
{
    77.04,81.76
     So anyways, that bicep muscle can be a source of a strain
},
{
    81.76,83.12
     and it can be the tendon.
},
{
    83.12,85.84
     And oftentimes it is the tendon that leads up
},
{
    85.84,86.96
     to the shoulder.
},
{
    86.96,89.24
     Now we're gonna talk about the anatomy of the bicep
},
{
    89.24,90.84
     because it's rather interesting.
},
{
    90.84,92.32
     Bytes to.
},
{
    92.32,93.16
     Sam muscles.
},
{
    93.16,95.56
     There's two muscles actually.
},
{
    95.56,97.6
     Now we don't actually, we're gonna use Sam.
},
{
    97.6,99.9
     Sam just has bones, no muscles.
},
{
    99.9,103.88
     But we can show you, this represents the tendon.
},
{
    103.88,107.32
     And right here, it connects to the radius,
},
{
    107.32,109.4
     just below the joint, the tendon does,
},
{
    109.4,113.4
     and then of course it goes to the bulgy mass of the bicep.
},
{
    113.4,118.04
     And then it splits, the muscle splits superior
},
{
    118.04,122.56
     or upwards of that major bulge of the muscle.
},
{
    122.56,126.84
     And there's a bicepital groove in the humerus right here.
},
{
    126.84,129.84
     And you can see how it fits right in there nicely.
},
{
    129.84,131.68
     Now that tendon, let's go this way,
},
{
    131.68,135.36
     that tendon actually connects to the top of the,
},
{
    137.44,138.36
     glenoid fossa.
},
{
    138.36,140.72
     The glenoid fossa or the cup of the,
},
{
    140.72,141.96
     where the humeral ball goes.
},
{
    141.96,143.6
     And it's right on the labrum there.
},
{
    143.6,145.04
     And you can see that there.
},
{
    145.04,147.74
     Now that's the long head of the bicep.
},
{
    147.74,150.0
     Now the short head comes,
},
{
    150.0,153.36
     and that tendon actually connects to the caracoid process,
},
{
    153.36,155.52
     this little bone that looks like a finger.
},
{
    155.52,158.28
     There's a few muscles attached to that.
},
{
    158.28,161.88
     So what happens is that can be a source
},
{
    161.88,164.2
     of the tendonitis up in this area.
},
{
    164.2,167.1
     You could have it on the tendon down below
},
{
    167.1,171.12
     or you could have a muscle strain in the muscle belly itself.
},
{
    171.12,173.52
     Either way, you can use this technique
},
{
    173.52,175.4
     to help heal it faster.
},
{
    175.4,178.04
     Yeah, one thing by showing that it attaches
},
{
    178.04,179.96
     way down in the forearm,
},
{
    179.96,182.28
     this muscle doesn't just do this.
},
{
    182.28,183.28
     Is it okay if I do this right?
},
{
    183.28,184.68
     Yeah, we're gonna talk about the mechanics.
},
{
    184.68,187.6
     Yeah, so it doesn't just do this. Is it okay if I do this right? Yeah, we're gonna talk about the mechanics. Yeah, so it doesn't just bend the elbow.
},
{
    187.6,192.6
     It also supernates, I'm sorry, pronates the forearm.
},
{
    192.6,194.2
     Supernates, supernates, yes.
},
{
    194.2,195.72
     Well, yeah, cause you can see when you supernate
},
{
    195.72,197.28
     the muscle go.
},
{
    197.28,201.0
     Right, so if you're doing curls,
},
{
    201.0,203.04
     you not only just wanna bend like this,
},
{
    203.04,205.08
     you also wanna super supinate the forearm.
},
{
    205.08,206.68
     Just turn it open.
},
{
    206.68,208.52
     Like Brad said, you used to remember,
},
{
    208.52,210.32
     the way to remember supination is
},
{
    210.32,211.88
     if you're going to get a couple of soups,
},
{
    211.88,212.72
     hold a couple of soups.
},
{
    212.72,214.0
     You can hold palms up.
},
{
    214.0,215.48
     Palms up like that.
},
{
    215.48,217.8
     So it's supinates and it flexes.
},
{
    217.8,222.52
     And it also flexes the shoulder a little bit.
},
{
    222.52,225.08
     Compensatory motion, but it's there.
},
{
    225.08,228.44
     So that's really critical to do this technique, right?
},
{
    228.44,229.88
     You have to know those motions.
},
{
    229.88,230.72
     All those motions.
},
{
    230.72,231.56
     Exactly.
},
{
    231.56,236.56
     So causes of biceps, tear, tendonitis, et cetera,
},
{
    236.78,237.62
     could be trauma.
},
{
    237.62,240.7
     You know, you're getting into accident, car accident.
},
{
    240.7,242.04
     It may be a sudden movement.
},
{
    242.04,246.08
     Like if you're playing volleyball and you hit really hard, could be an example.
},
{
    246.08,247.56
     Pulling a weed out of the ground.
},
{
    247.56,248.8
     Excessive force.
},
{
    248.8,250.08
     Yeah, excessive, right.
},
{
    250.08,253.08
     Grabbing too big of a dumbbell and just going into it
},
{
    253.08,255.0
     and really trying to build up too quick.
},
{
    255.0,257.28
     Quite often it is repetitive motions though,
},
{
    257.28,258.12
     isn't it Brad?
},
{
    258.12,262.16
     I mean, quite often life, things wear down over time.
},
{
    262.16,263.96
     And so if you're doing a repetitive motion
},
{
    263.96,268.22
     that involves the bicep, that's where often it occurs,
},
{
    268.22,269.78
     especially the tendonitis.
},
{
    269.78,270.86
     Can we get to the treatment?
},
{
    270.86,272.86
     Okay, you'll have to move.
},
{
    272.86,276.42
     Now it's best to do this laying down, lying down.
},
{
    276.42,277.26
     Laying down.
},
{
    277.26,278.46
     Oh, we're gonna lay down this time.
},
{
    278.46,279.3
     You're gonna lie down this time.
},
{
    279.3,280.14
     Okay.
},
{
    280.14,281.5
     I'm just gonna use one pillow,
},
{
    281.5,283.02
     we may need another pillow.
},
{
    283.02,286.48
     It's really important that you do this in a relaxed setting.
},
{
    286.48,288.6
     It's best by yourself.
},
{
    288.6,290.68
     You're gonna lay down and what we need to do
},
{
    290.68,295.0
     is get that bicep in a relaxed, shortened position.
},
{
    295.0,298.0
     So we're going to supinate,
},
{
    298.0,300.36
     we're gonna flex the elbow,
},
{
    300.36,302.72
     and we're gonna flex the shoulder
},
{
    302.72,305.6
     so we get way up into this position.
},
{
    305.6,308.84
     See now you see it's probably as short as it could be
},
{
    308.84,309.68
     in this position.
},
{
    309.68,310.64
     That's the goal.
},
{
    310.64,312.44
     You may need to, now,
},
{
    312.44,315.4
     because we have a small plinth here, there,
},
{
    315.4,317.84
     but on a bed or a floor,
},
{
    317.84,319.96
     you're gonna get a pillow here, here,
},
{
    319.96,321.44
     and at this point,
},
{
    321.44,324.64
     you may wanna move your elbow back and forth,
},
{
    324.64,326.92
     and what we're looking for is a position
},
{
    326.92,330.12
     of maximum comfort of where the injury is.
},
{
    330.12,332.76
     So once we shorten that muscle, again,
},
{
    332.76,337.24
     supinate, flex the elbow, flex the shoulder,
},
{
    337.24,340.48
     and then we find a position that's really comfortable
},
{
    340.48,342.0
     and then adjust the pillows
},
{
    342.0,345.32
     so you can completely relax that arm.
},
{
    345.32,348.16
     And let's say the pain when you're here
},
{
    348.16,349.64
     and you're moving it, you know,
},
{
    349.64,352.64
     you get to a six or seven pain on the painful area.
},
{
    352.64,355.68
     Wherever it is, when we shorten it up,
},
{
    355.68,357.24
     what we're looking for is a position,
},
{
    357.24,360.4
     a pain level of hopefully two or below.
},
{
    360.4,362.2
     One or zero is perfect.
},
{
    362.2,365.44
     And once you find it, then you get your timer out.
},
{
    365.44,367.84
     And it's critical that you're gonna hold this position
},
{
    367.84,370.56
     in a very relaxed, relaxed breathing.
},
{
    370.56,373.16
     Everything's relaxed for 90 seconds.
},
{
    373.16,374.64
     Not less than 90 seconds.
},
{
    374.64,376.68
     You can go longer, but not less.
},
{
    376.68,378.92
     So hit your timer and just hang out there
},
{
    378.92,380.56
     in a nice quiet breathe.
},
{
    380.56,382.24
     And you're gonna go for 90 seconds.
},
{
    382.24,384.92
     Now we're not gonna hold it for 90 seconds for the video.
},
{
    384.92,386.72
     Do that on your own, put it on hold.
},
{
    386.72,391.02
     And go ahead, you go up to 120 seconds.
},
{
    391.02,394.4
     And now it's critical when you're done with this
},
{
    394.4,396.66
     is that you just don't open up quickly.
},
{
    396.66,401.66
     You come up and let things extend and lengthen that bicep.
},
{
    402.28,404.68
     Slowly take your time, get up.
},
{
    404.68,406.76
     You're not gonna lift weights after this
},
{
    406.76,410.66
     or do any chores that extend or stress that bicep.
},
{
    410.66,413.7
     You can do a gentle massage on the muscle
},
{
    413.7,416.9
     to keep it loose or where the tendon is.
},
{
    416.9,420.6
     And then you're gonna do this three times per day.
},
{
    420.6,423.16
     And there's a good chance by the second day
},
{
    423.16,424.6
     it's feeling much better.
},
{
    424.6,428.48
     I did this exact same technique for a tennis ball.
},
{
    428.48,431.08
     I was amazed that I was doing some other techniques
},
{
    431.08,433.36
     that were helping, but this, by the next day
},
{
    433.36,434.2
     I forgot about it.
},
{
    434.2,435.04
     I was so impressed.
},
{
    435.04,438.34
     Isn't it amazing, you know, pain gets into these cycles
},
{
    438.34,441.56
     where it hurts so the muscle tightens up
},
{
    441.56,444.56
     and it's putting stress on it the entire day then.
},
{
    444.56,447.36
     And then that causes more pain,
},
{
    447.36,448.76
     which causes it to tighten up more.
},
{
    448.76,450.44
     It's the vicious cycle.
},
{
    450.44,452.28
     So this breaks up that cycle.
},
{
    452.28,455.08
     And that's why if you do it throughout the day,
},
{
    455.08,456.56
     three times or so,
},
{
    456.56,458.08
     you're breaking up the cycle during the day
},
{
    458.08,460.28
     and it lets that muscle relax and heal.
},
{
    460.28,463.0
     Get some blood flow to the area.
},
{
    463.0,464.24
     So, and this is nothing new.
},
{
    464.24,466.84
     This is a system called Contract Relax,
},
{
    466.84,469.16
     and it's been around for, I believe,
},
{
    469.16,470.32
     greater than 30 years.
},
{
    470.32,471.16
     Strain counter strain.
},
{
    471.16,473.28
     I'm sorry, strain counter strain.
},
{
    473.28,475.24
     Positional release is a new term.
},
{
    475.24,476.76
     Yeah, new term.
},
{
    476.76,477.92
     So anyways, it's a-
},
{
    477.92,481.32
     I look at it, Brad, it can be a tool in your toolbox.
},
{
    481.32,484.2
