{
    11.4,13.48
     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.
},
{
    13.48,14.32
     Brad Heineck, physical therapist.
},
{
    14.32,16.44
     Get the most famous physical therapists on the internet.
},
{
    16.44,17.88
     In our opinion, of course, Bob.
},
{
    17.88,19.88
     Today we're gonna go over five simple tricks, Brad,
},
{
    19.88,22.16
     for hand pain or finger pain.
},
{
    22.16,23.92
     These work out well for arthritis
},
{
    23.92,26.02
     or if you have a jammed finger
},
{
    26.02,28.94
     or if you just have hand pain overall, that's unexplained.
},
{
    28.94,30.02
     These are good for that.
},
{
    30.02,32.22
     Well, I actually smashed my finger
},
{
    32.22,35.54
     while I was doing a project with a 12-pound sledgehammer
},
{
    35.54,36.54
     a few weeks ago.
},
{
    36.54,37.58
     Self-inflicted.
},
{
    37.58,39.1
     Yeah, it was, yeah.
},
{
    39.1,40.18
     It sort of applies to this.
},
{
    40.18,41.66
     So we'll try it on yours today, Brad.
},
{
    41.66,43.26
     We'll see if we have any luck with it.

     We're gonna be doing giveaways all year,
},
{
    67.24,68.8
     but right now we're doing a giveaway
},
{
    68.8,70.76
     of the Sleepovation mattress.
},
{
    70.76,73.08
     Again, these are great mattresses,
},
{
    73.08,75.0
     and we're giving one away.
},
{
    75.0,76.76
     So these are top end.
},
{
    76.76,79.84
     Yeah, and if you're having trouble with comfort,
},
{
    79.84,81.64
     as far as like back pain or neck pain,
},
{
    81.64,84.28
     or shoulder, hip pain, that's your baby.
},
{
    84.28,85.78
     All right, let's talk about this first Brad.
},
{
    85.78,88.26
     The first thing you wanna do is you wanna make sure
},
{
    88.26,91.9
     that you're getting full range of motion in all the joints.
},
{
    91.9,94.06
     Especially a painful joint after a while,
},
{
    94.06,97.62
     it tends to tighten up and the more joint tightens up,
},
{
    97.62,99.3
     the more painful it becomes.
},
{
    99.3,100.74
     So it's kind of a bad cycle.
},
{
    100.74,102.18
     You wanna regain the motion
},
{
    102.18,104.94
     and a lot of times the pain levels go down.
},
{
    104.94,105.8
     So what I'm gonna do is,
},
{
    105.8,107.84
     we're gonna show you the motions to do,
},
{
    107.84,110.0
     and if you find out a particular joint
},
{
    110.0,112.84
     that bothers you while you're doing the motions,
},
{
    112.84,114.76
     we got some tricks for those
},
{
    114.76,117.56
     that we're gonna show you in the next three steps.
},
{
    117.56,120.76
     So try these, note which one's hurt,
},
{
    120.76,123.36
     and then we're gonna try these little tricks on those
},
{
    123.36,124.2
     after we do those.
},
{
    124.2,127.6
     So let's start off with number one, basically finger taps.
},
{
    127.6,129.24
     So you're taking the thumb and you're gonna tap it
},
{
    129.24,130.44
     to each finger.
},
{
    130.44,133.48
     So like this, and you're gonna open wide open
},
{
    133.48,134.6
     after you do it.
},
{
    134.6,138.28
     So we're making circles and then open up wide.
},
{
    138.28,139.96
     Good, and you can go reverse it,
},
{
    139.96,142.24
     come right back down the line.
},
{
    142.24,145.32
     Just a good warm up one, good stretch.
},
{
    145.32,147.6
     Okay, next one Brad, we're gonna go ahead
},
{
    147.6,149.24
     and we're gonna, this one's just working
},
{
    149.24,150.96
     kind of the base of the thumb.
},
{
    150.96,153.12
     So you're gonna take, and this is a problematic area
},
{
    153.12,154.96
     by the way, a lot of times in arthritis.
},
{
    154.96,156.72
     You're gonna take the thumb and you're gonna attach it
},
{
    156.72,159.6
     and take, take, touch over to the base of the fifth.
},
{
    159.6,160.44
     Can you get there?
},
{
    160.44,162.68
     No, my, my, can I get that far, Bob?
},
{
    162.68,165.0
     Yep, this is a stretch Brad should be doing.
},
{
    165.0,166.18
     Oh yeah.
},
{
    167.14,170.0
     Can you go to the base of this second figure right there?
},
{
    170.0,170.84
     Oh yes, yes.
},
{
    170.84,171.84
     Oh yes.
},
{
    171.84,173.6
     I can even do the Spock thing.
},
{
    173.6,175.08
     There we go, yep.
},
{
    175.08,177.56
     You can throw that one in there, that's the bonus one.
},
{
    177.56,180.16
     So as you can see right here,
},
{
    180.16,181.84
     Brad's just demonstrating on film,
},
{
    181.84,183.12
     it can be tight on people
},
{
    183.12,185.08
     and that's something you you can work on.
},
{
    185.08,186.44
     Give it a little stretch.
},
{
    186.44,189.6
     Yep, next one, we're gonna go ahead and do tabletop.
},
{
    190.64,193.96
     All right, you have a little trouble with that one too, Brad.
},
{
    193.96,196.72
     And then you can actually go from this one up to the claw
},
{
    196.72,199.2
     if you wanna do, you can throw two in a roll right here.
},
{
    199.2,202.68
     Well, you know, Bob, I'm sure I have some
},
{
    202.68,206.64
     early stage arthritis because my hands get real stiff in the morning,
},
{
    206.64,208.56
     particularly my right hand.
},
{
    208.56,212.44
     And so I do these in the morning to get warmed up.
},
{
    212.44,214.96
     Some something anyway, you do some range of motion.
},
{
    214.96,215.8
     Right, yeah.
},
{
    215.8,217.8
     And I don't do the table, well, we'll go on.
},
{
    217.8,218.64
     Cause these are good.
},
{
    218.64,219.48
     I just have some options.
},
{
    219.48,221.12
     You know, therapists make up their own stuff.
},
{
    221.12,221.96
     Sure.
},
{
    221.96,223.76
     And then you can go ahead and do full flexion.
},
{
    223.76,224.92
     This is where you're, you know,
},
{
    224.92,228.72
     you're flexing, fully flexing all the joints,
},
{
    228.72,230.04
     getting them all going.
},
{
    233.28,235.56
     Okay, so let's say in the instance,
},
{
    235.56,237.52
     you found one of your fingers bodied.
},
{
    237.52,239.04
     Let's say it's this joint here.
},
{
    239.04,240.92
     I'm gonna show it on the spine here first,
},
{
    240.92,243.0
     on Sam the skeleton.
},
{
    243.0,245.36
     So let's say we're looking at this joint right here.
},
{
    245.36,249.96
     So you have a bone above it, above it and below it.
},
{
    249.96,253.3
     And that forms the joint right there.
},
{
    253.3,256.96
     So the technique you're gonna try, it's a little tricky.
},
{
    256.96,261.28
     You're gonna push one of the bones this way,
},
{
    261.28,264.12
     and you're gonna push one of the bones this way.
},
{
    264.12,267.36
     This is a little advanced for the lay person, I think,
},
{
    267.36,268.2
     but we can get a try.
},
{
    268.2,269.28
     I think they can do it.
},
{
    269.28,270.12
     I think they can do it.
},
{
    270.12,270.96
     Let's give her a little try.
},
{
    270.96,274.0
     So let's say it's my joint right here.
},
{
    274.0,276.08
     I shouldn't use the middle finger, should I?
},
{
    276.08,278.36
     You can use, that would be the third digit.
},
{
    278.36,281.4
     All right, well, fourth, actually, in our lingo.
},
{
    281.4,283.28
     So I'm pushing with my thumb,
},
{
    283.28,285.6
     I'm pushing the bone this way, and with my finger, I'm pushing it this way. So I'm pushing with my thumb, I'm pushing the bone this way,
},
{
    285.6,287.52
     and with my finger I'm pushing it this way.
},
{
    287.52,289.16
     So I'm going opposite directions.
},
{
    289.16,290.28
     I'm pushing them,
},
{
    290.28,293.42
     and as I push them, I've been abetting the finger.
},
{
    293.42,296.94
     Now, if that hurts or hurts worse,
},
{
    296.94,298.2
     then you do the opposite.
},
{
    298.2,301.56
     You're gonna put your finger on top, right here,
},
{
    301.56,304.72
     and below here, and now I'm gonna push this way,
},
{
    304.72,306.56
     and I'm gonna go that way go all that feels better
},
{
    307.16,311.36
     So which figure you having trouble of red? Well, you can see the one that's got these scars
},
{
    311.36,316.08
     I'm still healing. Do you have trouble bending that one or not? It's getting much better, but I have
},
{
    316.8,321.4
     So you don't have pain when you're doing it. Well, if I last week this would have been a problem
},
{
    321.4,325.22
     Did you try this though? No, I didn't.
},
{
    327.26,329.98
     I worked similar to the claw and I'd use my other hand just to give it a little stretch.
},
{
    329.98,332.06
     Yeah, because it really wasn't in the joint so much
},
{
    332.06,334.42
     as when it kind of smushed the bone
},
{
    334.42,336.58
     and I think the tendon and the legament
},
{
    336.58,337.66
     where it was involved.
},
{
    337.66,339.62
     So it wasn't so much a joint itself,
},
{
    339.62,340.9
     it was a soft tissue between.
},
{
    340.9,342.18
     I had to get it stretched out
},
{
    342.18,344.02
     because it was starting to tighten.
},
{
    344.02,347.62
     So anyway, you can have somebody help you with this.
},
{
    347.62,349.66
     Somebody could actually push the bones for you.
},
{
    349.66,351.18
     But again, it works out,
},
{
    351.18,353.38
     I've done this before on jam fingers for me.
},
{
    353.38,355.46
     I pushed one this way and one this way.
},
{
    355.46,356.3
     It didn't work.
},
{
    356.3,358.14
     I reverse it and try it.
},
{
    358.14,361.96
     And one of them feels good, generally always for me.
},
{
    361.96,364.28
     If it doesn't, if it hurts both ways,
},
{
    364.28,365.12
     just stop doing it.
},
{
    365.12,366.44
     You don't do it.
},
{
    366.44,368.84
     The next thing you could try is a simple one.
},
{
    368.84,370.84
     You can try a little bit of traction.
},
{
    370.84,372.84
     Just do a little traction and even bend it
},
{
    372.84,374.6
     while you're doing a little traction.
},
{
    377.0,379.0
     How's that feel on your, Brad?
},
{
    379.0,380.84
     Yeah, I like the detraction one.
},
{
    380.84,383.32
     And actually, if you're relaxed,
},
{
    383.32,388.32
     I can actually feel my first MTP separate a little bit.
},
{
    388.76,391.36
     It's completely pain-free,
},
{
    391.36,393.92
     and it actually feels kinda good.
},
{
    393.92,395.28
     And then the last thing you could try
},
{
    395.28,398.08
     is actually, you could, what we call block the joint.
},
{
    398.08,400.8
     So let's say I'm working on this joint right here,
},
{
    400.8,402.32
     I can put my thumb right below it,
},
{
    402.32,406.36
     and I can block the movement from there.
},
{
    406.36,409.76
     So I'm working just right on that joint per se
},
{
    409.76,410.92
     and see if you can get that loose.
},
{
    410.92,413.08
     Now let's say I wanna work on this joint below.
},
{
    413.08,414.28
     I'm gonna go ahead and just go right,
},
{
    414.28,415.72
     I'm blocking right below.
},
{
    416.76,418.2
     I'm squeezing on both sides.
},
{
    418.2,421.6
     I'm holding the bone below on both sides.
},
{
    421.6,423.12
     I've done this with a lot of patients
},
{
    423.12,425.12
     after hand surgery or an injury,
},
{
    425.12,426.96
     and then I'll have them do it at home.
},
{
    426.96,429.2
     And I'll have them work individual joint
},
{
    429.2,432.4
     all the way down to the big knuckle.
},
{
    432.4,434.64
     And if these are all still hurting quite a bit
},
{
    434.64,436.18
     when you do these, I would recommend
},
{
    436.18,437.46
     you maybe try some modalities.
},
{
    437.46,439.92
     I'm gonna show you one that you'd have to purchase actually,
},
{
    439.92,441.72
     and then we're gonna show you one you can do at home
},
{
    441.72,443.38
     without having to purchase anything.
},
{
    443.38,445.32
     We like the Thermotex.
},
{
    445.32,447.0
     This is infrared heat.
},
{
    447.0,449.56
     The reason we like it is because normal heat
},
{
    449.56,452.48
     only penetrates a few millimeters.
},
{
    452.48,453.32
     Millimeters, yeah.
},
{
    453.32,454.96
     So I didn't even look at, do I have my,
},
{
    454.96,457.24
     no I looked for it before Bob.
},
{
    457.24,460.64
     Basically skin deep, it's not gonna get into the joint deep
},
{
    460.64,463.08
     where infrared is gonna do a nice job with that.
},
{
    463.08,466.5
     Well infrared will actually penetrate 2.36 inches.
},
{
    466.5,470.24
     And if you make it into a muff here basically,
},
{
    470.24,472.82
     it's actually gonna go 4.72 inches,
},
{
    472.82,473.7
     which in other words,
},
{
    473.7,476.48
     it's gonna go all the way through the finger joints.
},
{
    476.48,480.18
     And so, in addition to using this for anything else,
},
{
    480.18,484.5
     like you might have back pain or knee pain or hip pain,
},
{
    484.5,487.38
     Brad and I use it nightly on our backs.
},
{
    487.38,489.92
     It serves really well that you can sit and watch TV
},
{
    489.92,491.22
     and stick your hands in there
},
{
    491.22,492.68
     and kind of give yourself a treatment
},
{
    492.68,494.88
     and heat the whole joint up.
},
{
    494.88,497.24
     And then after that, or even while it's in there,
},
{
    497.24,499.08
     you could try to do some motion
},
{
    499.08,502.12
     or immediately after try to go ahead and get some motion.
},
{
    503.32,505.8
     So next thing is, if you don't want to spend the money
},
{
    505.8,508.84
     right now, you can try contrast baths.
},
{
    508.84,512.8
     So contrast baths meaning you're gonna use it for,
},
{
    512.8,515.56
     you gotta have two tubs, basically,
},
{
    515.56,517.6
     you can have two sinks and two tubs.
},
{
    517.6,520.72
     You're gonna fill one with basically water
},
{
    520.72,523.32
     that is as about as warm as you can tolerate.
},
{
    523.32,525.96
     Generally from like 100 to 110 degrees,
},
{
    525.96,527.48
     you can determine what it is you're talking.
},
{
    527.48,529.04
     It shouldn't be so uncomfortable.
},
{
    529.04,530.88
     It makes you wanna pull out and, you know.
},
{
    530.88,533.88
     It's all as tolerated without pain.
},
{
    533.88,536.36
     And then you have another tub with cold water.
},
{
    536.36,540.0
     And that should be as cold as you can tolerate without pain.
},
{
    540.0,542.8
     So 59 to 70 degrees somewhere in there.
},
{
    542.8,545.92
     So, you know, when you're heating up a joint,
},
{
    545.92,548.56
     you're gonna get increased oxygen circulation
},
{
    548.56,550.6
     and nutrients going into the joint.
},
{
    550.6,553.56
     And then when it cold, when it goes to the cold,
},
{
    553.56,555.74
     it's gonna close the blood vessels,
},
{
    555.74,558.52
     remove fluid and toxins and the waste and all that.
},
{
    558.52,561.52
     So it's kind of exercising the blood vessels.
},
{
    561.52,564.4
     It's things expands, things contract.
},
{
    564.4,567.62
     You got movement of the blood flow and lymph, whatnot.
},
{
    567.62,569.26
     So it's what we need.
},
{
    569.26,571.58
     Yeah, and what's nice, you can do your exercises.
},
{
    571.58,573.38
     So you have the two tubs of water.
},
{
    573.38,575.9
     You put your hand in the warm water first,
},
{
    575.9,577.54
     your hands in the warm water.
},
{
    577.54,579.5
     I've seen anywhere from up to five minutes,
},
{
    579.5,582.1
     but generally I recommend like three to four minutes.
},
{
    582.1,585.12
     Three to four minutes minutes and work your hands
},
{
    585.12,587.42
     and then go into the cold for just one minute.
},
{
    587.42,588.64
     So it's a, yeah.
},
{
    588.64,589.48
     It's not the same.
},
{
    589.48,590.84
     It's not the same ratio.
},
{
    590.84,593.92
     Back three to four, back to one.
},
{
    593.92,595.68
     Do this for like 20 to 30 minutes.
},
{
    595.68,597.84
     You're doing it, do your exercise in the water.
},
{
    597.84,602.2
     Just it works out as a great, what was that beeping noise?
},
{
    602.2,604.04
     Don't worry about that beeping Bob.
},
{
    604.04,605.64
     It just works as a great exercise
},
{
    605.64,607.0
     to try to help loosen up the joint,
},
{
    607.0,608.2
     get more blood flow to it.
},
{
    608.2,612.8
     You know, arthritic people really like the feel of it.
},
{
    612.8,614.36
     Bob, before we go any further,
},
{
    614.36,618.04
     I know almost 100% certain we're gonna have people ask,
},
{
    618.04,619.64
     Bob, what's going on with your finger?
},
{
    619.64,621.28
     Oh, I have dupertron's contraction.
},
{
    621.28,622.6
     Yeah, we have a lot of comments
},
{
    622.6,623.92
     that people are asking about that.
},
{
    623.92,627.56
     So we did a video on that particular diagnosis.
},
{
    627.56,630.24
     So if you happen to have that, you can look at our video.
},
{
    630.24,632.0
     So you know what's hilarious about this?
},
{
    632.0,634.4
     I swear to God, I had this for 10 years
},
{
    634.4,636.8
     and my wife did not know.
},
{
    636.8,638.48
     She did not know.
},
{
    638.48,640.12
     Until I pointed it out to her.
},
{
    640.12,641.44
     That's amazing.
},
{
    641.44,642.64
     That is amazing to me.
},
{
    642.64,644.56
     She's not attentive to your hand.
},
{
    644.56,645.48
     Apparently not. So. But it is amazing to me. She's not attentive to your hand. Apparently not.
},
{
    646.72,648.52
     But it doesn't bother me.
},
{
    648.52,649.96
     So I mean, I can golf and all that.
},
{
    649.96,652.08
     So that's why, the reason I don't get it corrected
},
{
    652.08,655.92
     because if you do like an injection, it'll work.
},
{
    655.92,657.4
     There's an injection you can do in surgery,
},
{
    657.4,658.92
     but it could come right back.
},
{
    658.92,659.76
     Sure.
},
{
    659.76,661.32
     So I'm like, yeah.
},
{
    661.32,662.84
     And it's not getting in the way.
},
{
    662.84,664.12
     His wife doesn't notice it.
},
{
    664.12,665.4
     My wife doesn't notice it. My wife doesn't notice it.
},
{
    665.4,667.28
     You know, people around me didn't notice it for years.
},
{
    667.28,669.08
     People on YouTube.
},
{
    669.08,671.44
     People, people, they'll YouTube care about me.
},
{
    671.44,673.48
     Yeah, they're very astute out there.
},
{
    673.48,676.16
     I'm telling you, we got high level people.
},
{
    676.16,678.28
     That's right, we got a lot of intelligence out there.
},
{
    678.28,679.12
     That's right.
},
{
    679.12,None
     Thanks for watching. Thank you.
