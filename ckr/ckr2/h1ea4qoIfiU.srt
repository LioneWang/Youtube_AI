     In a previous video we looked at about 15 different reasons why someone could be having
},
{
    5.84,7.72
     bad breath.
},
{
    7.72,13.64
     We learned that 85 to 90% of bad breath actually comes from the mouth or oral cavity.
},
{
    13.64,18.4
     We also learned that the tongue is a major source of bad breath.
},
{
    18.4,25.72
     In this video I am going to introduce you to a tool that I use to prevent bad breath and a tool I think every patient
},
{
    25.72,30.4
     and dental provider should have.
},
{
    53.84,56.08
     The tongue is an important muscle that helps us in digestion and contains small papilla that house our taste buds.
},
{
    56.08,60.8
     The roughened surface of the tongue contains so many small places for bacteria and debris
},
{
    60.8,62.72
     to accumulate.
},
{
    62.72,65.84
     Some people even have groovy or fissured tongues or have
},
{
    65.84,71.48
     a tongue that appears almost hairy due to the elongated papilla on the surface of the
},
{
    71.48,76.76
     tongue. As bacteria and debris accumulate on the tongue, it creates a tongue coating
},
{
    76.76,79.5
     that can contribute to bad breath.
},
{
    79.5,85.16
     So if the tongue is the primary contributor to bad breath. What can we do about it?
},
{
    85.16,91.04
     Well studies have shown that mechanical removal of the tongue coating results in a substantial
},
{
    91.04,93.88
     decrease in bad breath.
},
{
    93.88,98.48
     Tongue brushing, which is just brushing your tongue with your toothbrush, can actually reduce
},
{
    98.48,105.72
     over 70% of bad odors from the mouth compared to a 30% reduction of bad odors from tooth
},
{
    105.72,110.16
     brushing alone. So one solution is to simply brush your tongue with your
},
{
    110.16,115.44
     toothbrush every day. And that is a good option but I have another option that
},
{
    115.44,140.12
     works 10 times better. So this is the tongue cleaner.
},
{
    140.12,145.0
     Now I have personally tried many tongue cleaners on the market and no other product has came
},
{
    145.0,148.6
     close to comparing to this tongue cleaner.
},
{
    148.6,153.34
     This tongue cleaner is very sturdy and does a great job of removing the tongue coating
},
{
    153.34,156.6
     and just a couple of passes across the tongue.
},
{
    156.6,161.44
     I use the tongue cleaner twice a day after I brush my teeth and it is awesome.
},
{
    161.44,166.0
     You simply scrape this across the surface of your tongue and be warned.
},
{
    166.0,173.84
     The stuff that will be pulled off your tongue with this will be both disgusting and shocking.
},
{
    173.84,176.24
     Who knows, maybe it's just me.
},
{
    176.24,181.28
     This thing cleans way better than a toothbrush and you will notice a huge difference in your
},
{
    181.28,185.88
     breath in a very short amount of time after using this product.
},
{
    185.88,189.8
     Various studies on tongue cleaning have shown that not all methods available to clean the
},
{
    189.8,192.52
     tongue are equally effective.
},
{
    192.52,196.76
     For example, cleaning the tongue using a toothbrush has been shown to be less effective
},
{
    196.76,201.48
     than using a tongue cleaner designed specifically for this purpose.
},
{
    201.48,205.48
     I have not been able to find this product in stores as of recently.
},
{
    205.48,207.72
     I used to buy it at Walmart or Target,
},
{
    207.72,211.32
     but it doesn't appear that they carry it anymore.
},
{
    211.32,213.94
     Therefore, I order it on Amazon.
},
{
    213.94,216.04
     I'm gonna place a link in the description below
},
{
    216.04,217.32
     where you can go to Amazon
},
{
    217.32,219.68
     and purchase your very own tongue cleaner.
},
{
    219.68,221.68
     I've been using this product for years now
},
{
    221.68,223.1
     and in my personal opinion,
},
{
    223.1,228.34
     there is nothing that even compares to the results I get when I use this product.
},
{
    228.34,233.58
     I would recommend that you use this twice a day because aggressive overuse could cause
},
{
    233.58,235.38
     trauma to the tongue.
},
{
    235.38,240.3
     I would also warn you that if you gag easily, cleaning your tongue in general is going to
},
{
    240.3,242.42
     cause you to gag.
},
{
    242.42,246.76
     The tongue cleaner is actually faster to use than brushing the tongue with a toothbrush
},
{
    246.76,248.66
     and it is very effective.
},
{
    248.66,250.76
     Just use it fast and take breaks
},
{
    250.76,253.02
     if needed to minimize gagging.
},
{
    253.02,255.18
     I find that concentrating on my breathing
},
{
    255.18,259.0
     also helps minimize the gagging while I use this product.
},
{
    259.0,261.2
     All right, so that is gonna be all for this video.
},
{
    261.2,263.86
     I wanted to do a video just on the tongue cleaner
},
{
    263.86,266.0
     simply because of how awesome it is
},
{
    266.56,272.32
     and how it really helps to reduce bad breath. I hope you find this information useful and you
},
{
    272.32,276.96
     consider giving the tongue cleaner a try in the near future. In a future video we are going to look
},
{
    276.96,283.28
     at some other treatments for bad breath in case the tongue cleaner does not take care of all your
},
{
    283.28,286.56
     stinky breath. If you like this video, hit that like button,
