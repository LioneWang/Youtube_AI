     Rheumatoid arthritis or RA is an autoimmune disease where patients live with chronic pain.
},
{
    7.8,11.72
     It affects 1.3 million people and it's more common in women.
},
{
    11.72,13.98
     Here are five warning signs to look out for.
},
{
    13.98,19.82
     The pain that can happen in rheumatoid arthritis can affect multiple joints in the body.
},
{
    19.82,26.32
     So most patients with rheumatoid arthritis will have pain in their hands and wrists and that's
},
{
    26.32,30.52
     usually symmetric so it'll affect both hands and both wrists.
},
{
    30.52,33.16
     But it can affect other joints of the body too.
},
{
    33.16,41.52
     Other commonly involved areas are the knees, the ankles, the feet, the hips, elbows, shoulder,
},
{
    41.52,42.52
     and neck.
},
{
    42.52,46.68
     The stiffness is frequently worse in the morning and
},
{
    46.68,51.56
     patients will describe waking up and needing extra time to get ready for
},
{
    51.56,57.8
     their day and the stiffness can last from 30 minutes to upwards of two hours.
},
{
    57.8,62.92
     Usually that stiffness will get better with moving around and and getting
},
{
    62.92,67.92
     going. Sometimes a hot shower will help with stiffness,
},
{
    67.92,70.64
     and it can be an overall sense of stiffness,
},
{
    70.64,74.48
     or it can be localized to the hands or wrists.
},
{
    74.48,78.24
     Swelling can be seen in the hands and the wrists,
},
{
    78.24,81.2
     and the joints can really become enlarged,
},
{
    81.2,85.8
     and fluid can be present in the joint space itself.
},
{
    85.8,90.56
     You can also see fluid in the knees and the ankles.
},
{
    90.56,92.96
     You can have swelling in the feet as well.
},
{
    92.96,99.76
     The fatigue that some patients with rheumatoid arthritis can experience can really be overwhelming
},
{
    99.76,103.76
     and maybe the reason that they wind up going to a physician.
},
{
    103.76,105.78
     It can last all day, they can
},
{
    105.78,112.62
     sometimes have difficulty sleeping or sometimes they feel the need to sleep all the time.
},
{
    112.62,119.3
     Loss of function can occur for several different reasons. It can occur secondary to the pain
},
{
    119.3,125.64
     or stiffness in the joints or because of fatigue, patients may not exercise or do their
},
{
    125.64,133.32
     usual activities. Rheumatoid arthritis, if untreated, can lead to damage in the
},
{
    133.32,138.32
     joints and that damage that occurs in the joints can lead to loss of function
},
{
    138.32,143.4
     over time. When patients experience these different symptoms, they really
},
{
    143.4,149.08
     should be seen by their physician and referred to a rheumatologist. Those symptoms that we
},
{
    149.08,153.72
     listed for rheumatoid arthritis are not only seen in rheumatoid arthritis but
},
{
    153.72,158.78
     in other conditions as well and a rheumatologist would be in a good
},
{
    158.78,165.64
     position to help make that diagnosis. With everyday health, I'm Taryn Brill.
