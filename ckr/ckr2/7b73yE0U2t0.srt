{
    15.0,17.0
     I think your mic's working, Bob.
},
{
    17.0,18.0
     Enthusiasm, Bob.
},
{
    18.0,23.0
     Okay, today we're going to go over the best TMJ treatment you can do yourself.
},
{
    23.0,29.8
     Now, there's a lot of treatments that can be done, but this is the best one you can do yourself. TMJ, temporal mandibular or, well
},
{
    29.8,36.56
     actually you could call it TMJ, the mouth joint. No, temporal mandibular joint. Right.
},
{
    36.56,43.6
     And it's actually temporal mandibular disorders. Right. The joint is Alas, poor York, I knew
},
{
    43.6,46.68
     him Horatio. That's a little culture here Brad.
},
{
    46.68,47.68
     Let's get on with it.
},
{
    47.68,49.56
     All right Brad the joint is right here.
},
{
    49.56,51.56
     So right there.
},
{
    51.56,54.48
     Yeah you don't have your pointer today. Or do you?
},
{
    54.48,55.48
     Well yeah.
},
{
    55.48,60.64
     Okay well point right where it is and I'm going to actually pull this off.
},
{
    60.64,61.64
     Focus it in.
},
{
    61.64,63.4
     You can see the joint there. Got it Lonnie?
},
{
    63.4,65.0
     Dislocated and together.
},
{
    65.0,66.0
     Yep.
},
{
    66.0,71.0
     Alright, now when you're having TMJ problems, it's either that joint that's giving you trouble
},
{
    71.0,73.8
     or the muscles around the joint.
},
{
    73.8,74.8
     The ones that make it function.
},
{
    74.8,77.04
     Yep, the ones that close the jaw.
},
{
    77.04,80.12
     The one is the masseter, which is right here.
},
{
    80.12,81.32
     And the other one is the temporalis.
},
{
    81.32,82.72
     And this is actually a good picture.
},
{
    82.72,88.52
     You want to hold that together. So, Masider and Temporalis.
},
{
    88.52,90.44
     And you might even want to look at the fibers of that,
},
{
    90.44,92.04
     how the fibers are running.
},
{
    92.04,93.48
     Because we're going to be showing you
},
{
    93.48,95.64
     how to do your own massage to these.
},
{
    95.64,98.12
     And you want to go across the fibers at one point.
},
{
    98.12,100.72
     We're going to show you how to make circular massage
},
{
    100.72,101.84
     across the fibers.
},
{
    101.84,103.44
     Looks like one of those fans, you know?
},
{
    103.44,104.16
     Yeah, it does.
},
{
    104.16,105.6
     Looks like a little Japanese fan.
},
{
    105.6,111.28
     So, all right, let's go ahead and start Brad. Very good. You're going to go ahead and do the
},
{
    111.28,116.9
     massage. Yeah, so this is you're going to have pain here, maybe problems opening and closing your
},
{
    116.9,120.12
     jaws with the symptoms. Yeah, you have tension. A lot of times people are grinding their teeth at
},
{
    120.12,125.12
     night. Sure. Bruxism. You know, you wake up, you have little bits of teeth in your mouth. No.
},
{
    125.12,126.16
     OK.
},
{
    126.16,130.0
     All right, so a lot of times people get ear aches,
},
{
    130.0,132.48
     and they think that it's ear infection even.
},
{
    132.48,133.76
     So it's from the joint.
},
{
    133.76,137.72
     Popping joint, clicking, making noises, headaches.
},
{
    137.72,138.2
     Sure.
},
{
    138.2,140.52
     So all right, the first one we're going to start off with
},
{
    140.52,143.2
     is almost more of a myofascial technique, Brad.
},
{
    143.2,144.84
     So you're going to put your hands,
},
{
    144.84,149.84
     and your fingers should have enough oil on it that you don't really need to use any
},
{
    149.84,154.48
     oil. You're going to start on the bottom of the massager here. You're going to push in
},
{
    154.48,159.16
     and then while you're pushing in you're just going to let it roll up towards the top. So
},
{
    159.16,163.32
     it should be right on the muscle here. Right on the mandible here on the jaw and going
},
{
    163.32,165.68
     right up. Yeah, it feels good.
},
{
    165.68,170.0
     If you're eating chicken, you'll have plenty of grease on your fingers to do this.
},
{
    170.0,171.0
     All right.
},
{
    171.0,173.92
     And then now we're going to go up into the Temporalis.
},
{
    173.92,174.92
     Brad, yep.
},
{
    174.92,175.92
     The same thing.
},
{
    175.92,178.76
     You're just going to push in and push up.
},
{
    178.76,179.76
     Feels good.
},
{
    179.76,180.76
     Yep.
},
{
    180.76,181.76
     This isn't going to hurt for everybody even if you're having headaches.
},
{
    181.76,182.76
     It's good.
},
{
    182.76,183.76
     Yeah, it's going to be good for headaches.
},
{
    183.76,185.8
     Get those pain here for headaches.
},
{
    185.8,189.68
     This is one of those treatments that you really can't go wrong with.
},
{
    189.68,192.08
     If it doesn't help your pain here.
},
{
    192.08,194.08
     Right, there's nothing harmful here.
},
{
    194.08,196.32
     There's nothing good about this.
},
{
    196.32,199.92
     Alright, the next one Brad, just going to go ahead and using these three fingertips,
},
{
    199.92,202.76
     you're going to go right straight down like this.
},
{
    202.76,211.44
     And again, don't get into your cheek. We're back here. So we remember it's back. Yeah, the zygomatic arch wasn't that there you go
},
{
    211.44,213.28
     from your anatomy
},
{
    213.28,214.52
     So
},
{
    214.52,217.32
     Okay, the same with this one you're gonna. Just push up rad then
},
{
    218.76,224.48
     Okay, you can feel you know what to get used to the feeling underneath the skin where you're on the muscle
},
{
    224.56,226.96
     You know you should be able to do this.
},
{
    226.96,227.96
     Right.
},
{
    227.96,230.2
     Alright, the next one you're going to do Brad is you're actually going to do circles
},
{
    230.2,231.2
     now.
},
{
    231.2,233.16
     Now you can do it with the three fingertips, you can do it with your knuckles.
},
{
    233.16,234.16
     Okay.
},
{
    234.16,237.92
     And you're going to go like this, across the muscle like this.
},
{
    237.92,239.92
     Making circles, going across the muscle.
},
{
    239.92,242.48
     Remember, we're trying to go across those fibers.
},
{
    242.48,245.92
     You know, the fibers, we're going to cross them. And across the, we're going to go up those fibers. You know the fibers we're going to cross them across deep
},
{
    245.92,249.06
     We're gonna go up here and hit those up here cross the fibers
},
{
    251.24,253.24
     You seen any of this Lonnie I
},
{
    254.16,260.92
     Like this actually really relaxing very soon. All right the last set that you're gonna do Brad is you're actually gonna hold open
},
{
    260.92,273.56
     Hold open your jaw and then you can do the same massage. You can do the circle. I can't understand you Bob. So actually hold it open.
},
{
    273.56,277.76
     Is the jaw supposed to be loose then? Yeah. So you're trying to keep the muscles
},
{
    277.76,289.36
     relaxed. Yeah. Okay. That's different. Definitely different. And then you can also work it up in the temporalis.
},
{
    289.36,291.92
     I think you've got an idea.
},
{
    291.92,293.84
     So seriously this can actually help.
},
{
    293.84,297.36
     You can do 30 to 60 seconds each side.
},
{
    297.36,298.68
     You can do them together obviously.
},
{
    298.68,299.68
     Sure.
},
{
    299.68,302.96
     30 to 60 seconds on each muscle.
},
{
    302.96,305.36
     And you could even do this a couple times a day, Brad.
},
{
    305.36,308.0
     There's just really nothing negative about doing it.
},
{
    308.0,310.0
     Right, I think if you get positive results,
},
{
    310.0,311.16
     you can do it as needed.
},
{
    311.16,313.56
     Now, we're also gonna do another video
},
{
    313.56,315.76
     on the top three exercises you should do.
},
{
    315.76,317.92
     Now, these exercises are not gonna give you
},
{
    317.92,319.88
     immediate relief by any means.
},
{
    319.88,321.04
     They're for the long haul.
},
{
    321.04,322.84
     They're trying to prevent these muscles
},
{
    322.84,324.2
     from giving you trouble in the future.
},
{
    324.2,325.24
     There's a whole bunch of things about TMJ, They're for the long haul. They're trying to prevent these muscles from giving you trouble in the future. Sure.
},
{
    325.24,330.72
     There's a whole bunch of things about TMJ, posture that come into play and those exercises
},
{
    330.72,332.36
     are going to help you so.
},
{
    332.36,334.6
     When I get that one down, I'm going to link it to this one.
},
{
    334.6,335.6
     Okay.
},
{
    335.6,336.6
     Good idea.
},
{
    336.6,337.6
     So we'll see you at the end.
},
{
    337.6,338.6
     All right.
},

    338.6,339.6
     Thanks for watching.
},
