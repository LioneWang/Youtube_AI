     Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe here at SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. So if you're dealing with muscle
},
{
    15.44,20.24
     knots or muscle spasms in the lower back, the glutes, the buttocks, the hips, and need quick
},
{
    20.24,28.08
     relief, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss. All of these stretches and exercises are safe, effective, and it can be done at home.
},
{
    28.08,31.96
     You might find that they give you pain relief and muscle knot relief in as
},
{
    31.96,35.76
     little as 30 seconds. I'm going to be using two pieces of equipment. The first
},
{
    35.76,40.84
     being a lacrosse or a racquetball and the other a foam roller. Both of these can
},
{
    40.84,44.84
     be bought at a local sporting goods department. They're very inexpensive. You
},
{
    44.84,47.68
     can also get them online such as at Amazon. With all of these can be bought at a local sporting goods department. They're very inexpensive. You can also get them online, such as at Amazon.
},
{
    47.68,49.4
     With all of these exercises,
},
{
    49.4,51.12
     I'm going to show two different methods.
},
{
    51.12,53.32
     One that uses the racquetball,
},
{
    53.32,55.08
     the other one that uses the foam roller.
},
{
    55.08,57.6
     So go with the one that you feel offers you
},
{
    57.6,60.14
     the most amount of relief for getting rid of those muscle knots
},
{
    60.14,62.08
     into the lower back and hips.
},
{
    62.08,63.76
     So let's get started with them.
},
{
    63.76,67.5
     So let's first target muscle knots in the lower back and hips. So let's get started with them. So let's first target muscle knots in the lower back.
},
{
    67.5,70.88
     What I'm going to do is lay flat on a floor like this
},
{
    70.88,73.8
     and go next to a wall or a door.
},
{
    73.8,77.64
     Let's put the hips, the knees, and the ankles at 90 degrees.
},
{
    77.64,80.54
     I'm going to use my racquetball for this one.
},
{
    80.54,83.14
     So whatever side that you're having a muscle knot,
},
{
    83.14,85.2
     let's say it's on my right side in my
},
{
    85.2,90.72
     lower back, I'm going to take that lacrosse ball and put it right over that muscle knot
},
{
    90.72,92.24
     in the lower back.
},
{
    92.24,97.16
     What you want to do is just allow your body weight to sit upon it for about 10 seconds.
},
{
    97.16,102.44
     You're going to feel pressure building in there kind of like a self massage already starting.
},
{
    102.44,109.68
     What I'd like to do at that point is whatever side that I have that muscle knot, take that side's knee and do just a quick knee to
},
{
    109.68,114.78
     the chest. You're going to feel the lower back muscles start to tighten and build
},
{
    114.78,119.38
     more pressure over that muscle knot. It's going to make it more intense also, so
},
{
    119.38,122.86
     only go to your comfort level with this. If it feels like it's causing a lot of
},
{
    122.86,129.24
     discomfort, just please discontinue at that point. But we want to hold this one for 15 seconds. You're just
},
{
    129.24,135.64
     going to relax and then you're just going to repeat that up to five times. The next
},
{
    135.64,139.68
     part, and this one right here I think probably will work a little bit better. What I want
},
{
    139.68,146.16
     to do is take my hips and go into a circular motion with them. Almost think like you're doing a hula hoop motion.
},
{
    146.16,152.52
     So I just kind of rock my lower back in a nice circular motion with this one.
},
{
    152.52,157.04
     And you're just going to go in there and really self massage that muscle knot out.
},
{
    157.04,162.48
     Do this right here for about 15 seconds, take a little bit of a break, and then do it a
},
{
    162.48,164.32
     couple more times.
},
{
    164.32,169.68
     So when you do this, only go to the point where you feel that muscle not finally released.
},
{
    169.68,173.12
     But I like doing this one because you can use an iPad, you can use your phone, you could
},
{
    173.12,174.52
     read a book while doing it.
},
{
    174.52,179.04
     But once you're done, just put it over a different spot, switch to the other side and just target
},
{
    179.04,180.04
     those muscle knots.
},
{
    180.04,182.72
     It's a great way to be able to knock them out and fix it.
},
{
    182.72,187.16
     When it comes to lower back foam rolling, one of the biggest mistakes I see is taking
},
{
    187.16,190.62
     the foam roller and going directly over the lower back.
},
{
    190.62,196.72
     You don't want to do that because it can put the lumbar spine into hyper extension, jamming
},
{
    196.72,198.84
     it up and causing a lot of issues.
},
{
    198.84,204.6
     Instead, what you want to do is focus on the muscles to the sides of the spine.
},
{
    204.6,209.4
     So let's say that I have a lot of tightness and muscle knots on the right side of my lower
},
{
    209.4,210.4
     back.
},
{
    210.4,215.0
     What I'm going to do is just tilt my body towards that side and then I'm going to take
},
{
    215.0,220.28
     the foam roller, put it over there, lift my butt up and then at that point you can just
},
{
    220.28,225.88
     start to go over those muscles directly just like this, nice and slow,
},
{
    225.88,229.44
     all the way down to the top of the glutes or to the buttock.
},
{
    229.44,232.56
     And if you find a muscle knot that really is just bugging
},
{
    232.56,236.28
     you, at that point, just go over it very, very slowly.
},
{
    236.28,237.48
     But with this one right here,
},
{
    237.48,239.04
     you're foam rolling the muscles.
},
{
    239.04,242.64
     You're not going directly over the spine itself,
},
{
    242.64,245.32
     and you won't load and jam it up.
},
{
    245.32,248.96
     So this one right here, what I'd like to do is once I find a muscle knot, I go over it
},
{
    248.96,250.28
     very slowly.
},
{
    250.28,257.12
     Just slowly rock up and down for about 10 to 15 seconds, take a little bit of a breather,
},
{
    257.12,260.64
     and then you're just going to do that up to five times.
},
{
    260.64,264.48
     And you can repeat this process all the way up and down the lower back to the top of the
},
{
    264.48,265.58
     buttock or the glutes or
},
{
    266.0,268.46
     Just switch to the other side. So for the next part
},
{
    268.46,273.88
     We're going to focus on the very low low back and the top of the glutes or the buttocks
},
{
    273.88,277.44
     So let's say that you have a lot of muscle knots and a lot of muscle tightness right here
},
{
    277.56,279.68
     Kind of around the belt line maybe a little bit lower
},
{
    279.68,283.46
     I'm going to be positioning the ball up and down the glute right through here
},
{
    283.46,287.36
     So let's lay on the side that you're having that muscle knot.
},
{
    287.36,291.18
     You're just going to lay completely on your side just like this.
},
{
    291.18,296.28
     Position the ball right over that muscle knot and then roll upon it.
},
{
    296.28,302.32
     So my muscle knot right there on my left side is right about at the top of the glute or
},
{
    302.32,303.44
     the buttock.
},
{
    303.44,306.08
     Take the hand that's closest to the floor right here
},
{
    306.08,308.8
     and just stabilize yourself at the elbow at 90 degrees.
},
{
    308.8,313.4
     Put your arms out, your legs outstretched just like this.
},
{
    313.4,315.2
     The bottom leg, what I'm going to do is
},
{
    315.2,317.86
     I'm going to bring this one up towards the chest
},
{
    317.86,320.24
     while the other one goes straight just like that.
},
{
    320.24,322.12
     You're going to feel pressure being built
},
{
    322.12,325.6
     into the glute already over the ball itself. This is how we're going to feel pressure being built into the glute already over the ball itself.
},
{
    325.6,327.88
     This is how we're going to really target it.
},
{
    327.88,330.44
     I'm going to take my hand on the opposite side.
},
{
    330.44,335.68
     I'm going to grab below the knee and I'm going to bring that knee up like this.
},
{
    335.68,339.28
     I'm rotating my left knee towards my right side.
},
{
    339.28,343.64
     This right here really gets that glute to fire and tighten up.
},
{
    343.64,346.0
     You're able just to control how much pressure
},
{
    346.0,352.0
     you're going to be putting from the racquetball into that muscle. Hold this one for about 15 seconds,
},
{
    352.0,359.0
     relax and then repeat this one up to five times or until you feel that muscle knot start to release.
},
{
    359.0,368.0
     If you feel like you need a little bit more of an intense one, you can actually lift the leg up completely like this and allow the muscles to completely fire.
},
{
    368.0,370.52
     This one right here is a little bit more advanced.
},
{
    370.52,374.52
     So you just kind of lift it up straight up like this instead of trying to keep the heel
},
{
    374.52,375.98
     on the floor like that.
},
{
    375.98,377.48
     So give those ones a try.
},
{
    377.48,380.36
     Those ones work really well for glute muscle spasms.
},
{
    380.36,385.56
     So the foam roller method is also another good way to get rid of muscle knots over the
},
{
    385.56,389.28
     lower portion of the lower back and into the glutes or buttock.
},
{
    389.28,393.76
     Whatever side that I'm having a lot of muscle spasming or muscle tightness, what I want
},
{
    393.76,399.36
     to do is take that side's leg and put it over the other just like this.
},
{
    399.36,401.52
     Kind of like you're lounging almost.
},
{
    401.52,404.08
     This creates what is known as a figure four stretch.
},
{
    404.08,405.2
     It's really going to help
},
{
    405.2,410.56
     stretch the glute, also the piriformis. And it's another note, if you are dealing with piriformis
},
{
    410.56,416.64
     syndrome, I don't recommend this exercise because it can actually put more pressure into that muscle,
},
{
    416.64,422.0
     causing more irritation possibly onto the sciatic nerve. So if you start to get any symptoms going
},
{
    422.0,427.4
     down the leg that mimic piriformis syndrome, please discontinue this immediately.
},
{
    427.4,430.72
     So getting back to this exercise, what I'm going to do is I'm going to just put my arms
},
{
    430.72,438.34
     back just like this and I'm going to just put my weight onto that side's glued or buttock.
},
{
    438.34,446.24
     And then I'm just going to rock back and forth with the foam roller from the lower portion of the lower back all
},
{
    446.24,452.36
     the way down to the butt bone. And what I'm going to do is just go over those
},
{
    452.36,457.88
     muscle spots. Once I find the one that feels very tight I just simply rock on
},
{
    457.88,463.72
     it very slowly for up to 15 seconds. Just take a little bit of a breather and
},
{
    463.72,466.56
     then do that up to three to five times
},
{
    466.56,471.68
     or until you feel that muscle knot start to relax. And then you can just simply switch to the other
},
{
    471.68,476.88
     side or just go over different spots as needed. So for this next part we're going to focus more on
},
{
    476.88,486.96
     muscle knots and muscle spasms in the soft tissue around the hip joint. So let's start flat on our back with our knees bent just like this.
},
{
    486.96,492.56
     Let's take our racket ball and place it over the hip where you're having a lot of muscle
},
{
    492.56,493.56
     knots.
},
{
    493.56,497.64
     What I'm going to do then is I'm going to bring that side's knee up towards the chest
},
{
    497.64,504.6
     like this and then I'm going to then roll over the ball until my lower leg makes contact
},
{
    504.6,505.72
     completely with the floor.
},
{
    505.72,510.12
     Let's take the other leg and go completely flat with the foot like this
},
{
    510.12,515.2
     to help stabilize us during this exercise. The bottom arm is going to be
},
{
    515.2,519.72
     outreached just like this for more stabilization. So with this knee bent,
},
{
    519.72,524.52
     what I'm going to do is I'm going to then start to straighten it as much as I'm
},
{
    524.52,525.84
     able to go.
},
{
    525.84,529.9
     If you're having a lot of soreness due to those muscle knots in the hip, you're going
},
{
    529.9,531.64
     to really feel this.
},
{
    531.64,537.18
     So once that leg is completely straight, try to hold this for up to 10 seconds.
},
{
    537.18,543.34
     This is the second part that's going to make it even more intense for those muscle spasms.
},
{
    543.34,546.64
     While the leg is straight, just simply lift it up,
},
{
    546.64,551.76
     or I should say the leg up towards the ceiling as far as you're able to go. This should really
},
{
    551.76,556.24
     put a lot of pressure into that muscle knot and hopefully give you a very good self-release or
},
{
    556.24,561.84
     self-massage. Hold this one for 15 seconds. You're just going to relax. You're then going to bring
},
{
    561.84,569.4
     that side's knee up towards the chest into the starting position, take a little bit of a breather, and then just simply repeat this
},
{
    569.4,574.1
     as many times as needed, usually up to about five times before you feel that muscle knot
},
{
    574.1,575.72
     really start to relax.
},
{
    575.72,579.36
     And then you can just reposition it over a new spot or switch to the other side.
},
{
    579.36,584.52
     So this is how we're going to fix muscle knots and muscle spasms around the hip with a foam
},
{
    584.52,586.4
     roller. Go to the side that you are looking to target those muscle knots and muscle spasms around the hip with a foam roller. Go to the side that you
},
{
    586.4,592.16
     are looking to target those muscle knots. So what I'm going to do is place my foam roller
},
{
    592.16,597.44
     right over the muscle and soft tissue of the hip and then from there I'm kind of in a nice plank
},
{
    597.44,602.96
     position. So my arm right here has been at 90 degrees supporting my upper body while my feet are
},
{
    602.96,606.68
     together and my body is kind of in a nice straight line.
},
{
    606.68,611.08
     What I do is I just bend the top leg like this just for a little bit of stability while
},
{
    611.08,614.16
     the bottom leg stays straight.
},
{
    614.16,620.16
     Use your foot on the bottom leg and also the arm right here to just slowly roll up and
},
{
    620.16,623.94
     down the muscle and soft tissue around the hip.
},
{
    623.94,626.34
     You're going to find a spot that's just really, really
},
{
    626.34,628.14
     tender with that muscle spasm.
},
{
    628.14,630.18
     So that's the one that you really wanna focus on.
},
{
    630.18,633.06
     Just go up and down it very, very slowly
},
{
    633.06,635.38
     for about 15 seconds.
},
{
    635.38,637.66
     Take a little bit of a breather
},
{
    637.66,640.46
     and then do this up two, three to five times
},
{
    640.46,644.26
     or until you feel that muscle spasm really start to go away.
},
{
    644.26,647.88
     And then just reposition it or switch to the other side. It's a great way to really
},
{
    647.88,651.32
     target those muscle knots. So if you liked the video and got a lot of relief
