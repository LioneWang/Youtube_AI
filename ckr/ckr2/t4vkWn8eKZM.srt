{
    0.0,6.12
     Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, gosh, it might be a rotator cuff.
},
{
    6.12,7.8
     How do I know if that's what it is?
},
{
    7.8,8.8
     That's a good question.
},
{
    8.8,9.8
     Let's find out.
},
{
    9.8,13.84
     Dr. Craig here from the Prehab Guys.
},
{
    13.84,15.16
     I have a rush here.
},
{
    15.16,19.0
     We're going to be talking everything that you need to know about rotator cuffs.
},
{
    19.0,22.64
     So a rush, young strapping male in his late 20s.
},
{
    22.64,25.3
     He's coming to me and telling me that his shoulder hurts.
},
{
    25.3,27.06
     If we're talking about rotator cuffs,
},
{
    27.06,30.56
     we have to get an idea of what is the typical pattern
},
{
    30.56,34.62
     with rotator cuff issues, with rotator cuff issues.
},
{
    34.62,36.26
     Say that 10 times in a row.
},
{
    36.26,38.18
     So with the Rochebean in his late 20s,
},
{
    38.18,41.14
     I'm thinking he likely did too much too soon.
},
{
    41.14,43.62
     What would that be defined as if you saw a doctor
},
{
    43.62,44.54
     or you got an image?
},
{
    44.54,45.04
     Maybe that's
},
{
    45.04,51.92
     rotator cuff tendonitis. Too much too soon. Overwork the tendon. Maybe it's a little bit inflamed.
},
{
    51.92,57.36
     He'll do very well with rehab. Now, let's say that I meet a rush in 20 years. He's in his mid to
},
{
    57.36,63.76
     late 40s. He's been dealing with this for a while. There's no insidious issue with it. He wasn't just
},
{
    63.76,65.08
     doing deltoid raises and
},
{
    65.08,70.14
     hurt it. This has been going on for months on end. Now I'm thinking maybe this is tendon
},
{
    70.14,78.24
     gnosis or maybe on an MRI report you got degenerative changes in the tendon. This is just wear and
},
{
    78.24,86.36
     tear. There's changes to the tendon. It's been broken down. There's some disorganized and crappy tissue quality
},
{
    86.36,88.96
     with the connective tissue in the collagen.
},
{
    88.96,92.24
     And but now let's say that I met Arash 40 years later
},
{
    92.24,95.6
     and he is now in his mid-late 60s.
},
{
    95.6,98.96
     He was lifting an object and then he heard a snap
},
{
    98.96,100.88
     and now he can't move his arm as much.
},
{
    100.88,104.36
     I'm thinking maybe more like a rotator cuff tear
},
{
    104.36,105.66
     just because of the age
},
{
    105.66,110.84
     and the scenario. Those are all things to keep into account. If you are in your early
},
{
    110.84,115.24
     20s, you're more than likely you didn't have a rotator cuff tear if you're just doing
},
{
    115.24,120.2
     deltoid raises. Now let's get into it. How do you know what's going on? How do we roll
},
{
    120.2,124.36
     in the rotator cuff or is there something else going on? That's what we're going to
},
{
    124.36,125.16
     jump into.
},
{
    125.16,127.6
     So Arash, let's have you stand up.
},
{
    127.6,130.48
     I'm just going to look at range of motion to start.
},
{
    130.48,132.16
     So Arash is going to mirror me.
},
{
    132.16,135.92
     Arash, what I want you to do is just rotate your arms in and out.
},
{
    135.92,138.8
     We're looking at shoulder external rotation here.
},
{
    138.8,140.8
     He has full range of motion.
},
{
    140.8,144.24
     Say that Arash went, only got to here, and then only got to there.
},
{
    144.24,145.88
     I'm like, uh-oh, that's not good.
},
{
    145.88,146.88
     That could be a tear.
},
{
    146.88,148.56
     Then what I would do is a rush.
},
{
    148.56,150.24
     I'm going to take your arm all the way out here.
},
{
    150.24,151.68
     Can you hold it there?
},
{
    151.68,152.8
     Perfect.
},
{
    152.8,156.96
     Say that I did this, I took it out there and the arm just came back in thinking it could
},
{
    156.96,158.12
     be a big tear.
},
{
    158.12,160.68
     But again, a rush is age in the scenario.
},
{
    160.68,161.68
     We're not thinking that.
},
{
    161.68,163.8
     We're going to look at external rotation.
},
{
    163.8,168.24
     Now let's just look at shoulder flexion. So now with shoulder flexion, I'm looking
},
{
    168.24,172.72
     at his range of motion as well as the quality of the motion. So, Raj, do you have
},
{
    172.72,178.76
     any pain with this while you do it? No. No. Okay, well maybe what if he did? Say
},
{
    178.76,183.92
     that he had pain just within this arc of motion we call it. Sometimes if you ticked
},
{
    183.92,185.36
     off your rotator cuff,
},
{
    185.36,188.02
     it may hurt once he gets to about here,
},
{
    188.02,189.44
     or maybe up to here,
},
{
    189.44,191.24
     somewhere within this window,
},
{
    191.24,192.8
     but then it feels better.
},
{
    192.8,195.92
     Definitely thinking maybe his rotator cuff is involved.
},
{
    195.92,199.16
     Or what if he had pain all the way at the top?
},
{
    199.16,200.72
     Well, it could be the rotator cuff,
},
{
    200.72,205.0
     but it also could be subacromial impingement symptoms.
},
{
    205.0,211.0
     Symptoms, maybe something's getting pinched or something is irritated in this space called the subacromial space.
},
{
    211.0,214.0
     Last but not least, let's do abduction.
},
{
    214.0,218.0
     Same thing, all the same rules apply for what we're looking for reflection.
},
{
    218.0,222.0
     Is there a painful range? Is there pain at the end range?
},
{
    222.0,225.06
     This is all just giving me a little bit of information.
},
{
    225.06,227.96
     For a rush, maybe it hurt up at the top.
},
{
    227.96,230.16
     Maybe it hurt within some range.
},
{
    230.16,233.44
     We're thinking rotator cuff or maybe impingement stuff.
},
{
    233.44,235.8
     Now let's go into strength testing.
},
{
    235.8,240.24
     Not necessarily getting a really good gauge of how strong a rush is, but I'm looking for
},
{
    240.24,243.08
     is there any weakness or is there any symptoms?
},
{
    243.08,245.16
     Now, rush, hold real strong here.
},
{
    245.16,246.72
     This is good to do with a friend,
},
{
    246.72,248.24
     but if you don't have a friend,
},
{
    248.24,251.28
     you could always do this with a wall or with a rig.
},
{
    251.28,254.44
     So Arash, hold nice and strong, don't let me move you.
},
{
    254.44,256.16
     What I'm trying to do is let me move you.
},
{
    256.16,258.6
     I'm trying to push Arash's arms in.
},
{
    258.6,261.04
     Hold nice and strong, don't let me move you.
},
{
    261.04,263.96
     We're testing his shoulder external rotators.
},
{
    263.96,267.44
     So the rotator cuff is going to be your infraspinatus,
},
{
    267.44,273.52
     teres minor, super spinatus, and then subscapularis. The external rotators are going to be your
},
{
    273.52,278.72
     infraspinatus and teres minor. Also, super spinatus may help with that a little bit as
},
{
    278.72,282.72
     well. That's what we're testing with this one. Now we're just going to do the opposite
},
{
    282.72,287.92
     motion. Don't let me move you. Now we're looking at internal rotation. Any issue with either
},
{
    287.92,291.88
     of those? Cool. Now we're going to do a little bit of this chicken wing here. Hold
},
{
    291.88,296.64
     nice and strong. Don't let me move you. I'm trying to push them down. Say that this
},
{
    296.64,300.04
     was bothering him. We could mess around and do a little bit of different angles.
},
{
    300.04,304.36
     We could do here. We could do up here. Yes, we're hitting the deltoid with this,
},
{
    304.36,307.4
     but also we're hitting some of that super spinatus as well.
},
{
    307.92,315.56
     So that's just giving me more info. A test that is a little bit more specific to the simple super spinatus is going to be our open can test.
},
{
    316.0,319.56
     So we're thinking 30 degrees away from the
},
{
    319.92,325.52
     braid ahead, 30 degrees out, thumbs up, arms externally rotated.
},
{
    325.52,328.16
     Hold nice and strong, don't let me move you.
},
{
    328.16,329.92
     I'm going to lower my body weight into it.
},
{
    329.92,331.12
     Rosh, any issue with that?
},
{
    331.12,331.62
     Good.
},
{
    331.62,334.96
     That's a little bit more specific to the super spinatus.
},
{
    334.96,339.36
     Now, last but not least, let's get your arms set up here.
},
{
    339.36,342.24
     Hold nice and strong, don't let me move you.
},
{
    342.24,344.16
     Hold, hold, hold.
},
{
    344.16,344.6
     Good.
},
{
    344.6,346.68
     And then can you get your arm here? Hold nice and strong, don't let me move you. Hold, hold, hold. Good, and then can you get your arm here?
},
{
    346.68,349.48
     Hold nice and strong, don't let me move you.
},
{
    349.48,353.6
     With this test, what we're looking at is Terry's minor
},
{
    353.6,354.8
     and her first spinatus again.
},
{
    354.8,357.0
     It's just a different angle, especially if you're a weight
},
{
    357.0,358.24
     lifter, you're doing shoulder press,
},
{
    358.24,359.48
     you have issues with that.
},
{
    359.48,361.28
     This is another good one to look at.
},
{
    361.28,362.44
     Can you even get here?
},
{
    362.44,365.04
     You know, if I brought his arm back but it flopped forward
},
{
    365.04,370.32
     or even if I lifted his arm, can he hold it there? Those are signs. Those are tests for like big
},
{
    370.32,376.8
     tears. If I brought it here and it just dropped, I'd be like, uh-oh, not so good. Okay, so those are
},
{
    376.8,381.36
     the big tests that you can do. Last but not least, maybe if you see a physical therapist,
},
{
    381.36,391.28
     they may do tests like this. They may have the thumb down, pushing up like this, this is looking at impingement stuff. So are we actually
},
{
    391.28,397.16
     able to recreate symptoms due to maybe something in that subacromial space or
},
{
    397.16,401.76
     is there internal pinchment? Are things getting pinched inside the shoulder joint?
},
{
    401.76,405.5
     I would say keep that to a professional to get those things checked out.
},
{
    405.5,409.04
     Just because they're not the greatest test standalone,
},
{
    409.04,410.64
     like I spoke about earlier.
},
{
    410.64,412.48
     And then if you're just trying to do a party trick
},
{
    412.48,415.0
     with friends, we're not gonna recommend this stuff.
},
{
    415.0,418.28
     Okay, now how do we really roll in the tendon?
},
{
    418.28,420.8
     So we just did all the strength testing, right?
},
{
    420.8,423.84
     Arash, what I'm going to assume,
},
{
    423.84,427.08
     if it's truly a rotator cuff thing, if it's the tendon,
},
{
    427.08,430.88
     he's going to be strong, but maybe it's a little bit painful.
},
{
    430.88,432.84
     Arash, guess what?
},
{
    432.84,434.56
     This hurts, right?
},
{
    434.56,435.56
     It hurts.
},
{
    435.56,436.56
     It hurts.
},
{
    436.56,437.56
     It hurts.
},
{
    437.56,438.56
     But he's still strong.
},
{
    438.56,440.24
     It's not weaker side to side.
},
{
    440.24,443.24
     So what we're going to do is we're going to come over here.
},
{
    443.24,448.8
     Arash, we're just going to do an isometric and isometric exercises.
},
{
    449.12,453.08
     The tendon isn't lengthening or it's not getting any shorter, but all the muscles
},
{
    453.08,457.16
     are working. And if you hold it long enough, and if we do enough rounds of it,
},
{
    457.46,459.44
     it gives you this analgesic effect.
},
{
    459.68,462.16
     We don't really understand why that happens,
},
{
    462.32,467.68
     but it's going to make your shoulder feel better if it's truly a tendon issue. So thank you so much for getting into the
},
{
    467.68,472.16
     perfect position knowing how to do this. But as you can see, a rush is just
},
{
    472.16,476.94
     holding this position. He's doing isometric external rotation. He's not
},
{
    476.94,481.66
     letting me pull this in. Stay where you are, but he's not letting this motion
},
{
    481.66,490.16
     happen. Bring the camera around this way. I'm going to show you something that's really important. Something that you need to be mindful of, Rosh, as you do this,
},
{
    490.16,495.92
     sit up nice and tall. This shoulder blade needs to be pulled back. If he's doing this,
},
{
    495.92,502.0
     but his shoulder blade is winging up or his shoulder blade is moving, the rotator cuff is
},
{
    502.0,507.3
     just getting pulled from a different position. He's anchoring there, but it's getting stretched this way.
},
{
    507.3,510.78
     So you've got to have a stable shoulder blade when you do this stuff.
},
{
    510.78,515.66
     So now Arash would do five rounds of this for 45 second holds.
},
{
    515.66,517.98
     And then time elapsed.
},
{
    517.98,519.18
     It's 10 minutes later.
},
{
    519.18,521.82
     Arash felt a really good burn all back here.
},
{
    521.82,525.36
     It's also another sign to know if you're doing it right or not.
},
{
    525.36,527.92
     Come back to this, hold nice and strong.
},
{
    527.92,529.16
     Don't let me move you.
},
{
    529.16,531.24
     Hold, hold, hold.
},
{
    531.24,532.2
     How does it feel?
},
{
    532.2,533.04
     Good.
},
{
    533.04,533.96
     It feels better, right?
},
{
    533.96,534.8
     Yeah, better.
},
{
    534.8,535.64
     Awesome.
},
{
    535.64,536.48
     If that's the case,
},
{
    536.48,539.38
     I'm thinking his tendon is likely involved.
},
{
    539.38,540.72
     So now what do you do?
},
{
    540.72,541.56
     Well, guess what?
},
{
    541.56,544.32
     He just showed you the exercises that you're gonna do.
},
{
    544.32,547.0
     You're gonna do isometrics to start.
},
{
    547.0,549.36
     Say that going in bothered him.
},
{
    549.36,551.48
     You're just going to do it going in.
},
{
    551.48,553.48
     Say that this hurt.
},
{
    553.48,558.24
     What you can do is a rush or even let's say that the open can hurt.
},
{
    558.24,560.6
     That's not unfamiliar to be bothersome.
},
{
    560.6,562.88
     Let's just do an isometric open can.
},
{
    562.88,565.92
     So just go up out to the side and then hold it there.
},
{
    565.92,569.52
     Again, nice and strong, stack through a shoulder blade,
},
{
    569.52,573.52
     or he can even do an isometric lateral raise.
},
{
    573.52,577.0
     The takeaway is, if you're still strong,
},
{
    577.0,579.64
     but it hurts testing some of that stuff,
},
