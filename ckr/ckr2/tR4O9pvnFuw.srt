     Hello, my name is Rich Hawkins.
},
{
    19.84,23.4
     I'm an orthopedic surgeon with the Stedman Hawkins Clinic in the Carolinas, in Greenville,
},
{
    23.4,26.24
     South Carolina working with the Greenville Hospital System.
},
{
    26.24,29.6
     This is a teaching video to help those of you who are interested in the care of the
},
{
    29.6,34.16
     head and neck injured athlete on the field and transport off the field to the nearest
},
{
    34.16,35.72
     hospital facility.
},
{
    35.72,39.76
     It's extremely important that we manage these people carefully so that we do not worsen their
},
{
    39.76,43.64
     injuries in any way, particularly if they have a neurological deficit.
},
{
    43.64,48.72
     This video will demonstrate the technique of immobilization, how to handle a face mask
},
{
    48.72,52.96
     and remove it carefully, leaving the helmet and chin strapped in place, and then carefully
},
{
    52.96,58.0
     log rolling the patient onto a backboard, immobilizing them and they're carefully transporting
},
{
    58.0,59.8
     them to the nearest hospital.
},
{
    59.8,65.24
     These injuries occur with usually contact on the top of the head and axial neck injury
},
{
    65.24,70.64
     resulting sometimes in unconsciousness and or neck injury.
},
{
    70.64,74.6
     Breathing must be controlled and that's why we have to remove that face mask to be sure
},
{
    74.6,76.6
     we have access to the airway.
},
{
    76.6,81.12
     And then immobilization of the neck if it is a neck injury so that the injury is not
},
{
    81.12,82.92
     worsened any further.
},
{
    82.92,85.96
     Our concern of course with head injuries that we always have to assume
},
{
    85.96,88.04
     there is an associated neck injury.
},
{
    88.04,90.16
     So with that we'll pass this on to the trainers
},
{
    90.16,91.36
     in the Greenville system
},
{
    91.36,93.84
     to teach us how to manage these specifically
},
{
    93.84,94.92
     on the field of play.
},
{
    96.36,98.04
     The log roll technique is appropriate
},
{
    98.04,101.04
     if the athlete is found in a prone position
},
{
    101.04,102.76
     and not breathing.
},
{
    102.76,104.84
     Position the athlete's arm to the side
},
{
    104.84,105.4
     of the athlete before arm to the side of the athlete
},
{
    105.4,109.0
     before attempting to log roll.
},
{
    116.88,122.84
     The first medical personnel on the scene is the leader. This person should issue
},
{
    122.84,131.0
     all commands. Can you hear me? You okay? There's no response. I want you to go get me some help. Call 911.
},
{
    131.0,137.0
     The leader should take control of the injured person's head. The leader holds the head with both hands,
},
{
    137.0,142.0
     stabilizing it by holding firmly and allowing no emotion.
},
{
    142.0,145.0
     We're going to have to roll him supine.
},
{
    145.0,147.0
     I'm going to need one person at the shoulders,
},
{
    147.0,149.0
     one at the hips and one at the feet.
},
{
    149.0,153.0
     Direct all rescuers to reach across the injured person
},
{
    153.0,157.0
     and grab a hold of the upper arm and shoulder,
},
{
    157.0,160.0
     the pelvis and the legs.
},
{
    160.0,162.0
     Make sure to grab the body part
},
{
    162.0,165.0
     and not pull on the article of clothing.
},
{
    165.0,168.0
     Roll the interperson towards you upon the leader's call.
},
{
    168.0,169.0
     Roll on three.
},
{
    169.0,171.0
     One, two, three.
},
{
    174.0,176.0
     Roll the person down on the leader's call.
},
{
    176.0,178.0
     Down on three.
},
{
    178.0,180.0
     One, two, three.
},
{
    196.2,198.96
     If a spine board is available, logroll the athlete onto the spine board. The first medical personnel on the scene is the leader.
},
{
    198.96,200.92
     This person should issue all commands.
},
{
    200.92,203.44
     We need one person at the shoulder.
},
{
    203.44,207.0
     The leader should take control of the injured person's head.
},
{
    207.0,211.8
     The leader holds the head with both hands stabilizing it by holding firmly and
},
{
    211.8,216.88
     allowing no motion. Position the other rescuers on one side of the injured
},
{
    216.88,225.16
     person, one of the chest, one of the pelvis, and one at the legs.
},
{
    225.16,230.88
     Place the spine board along the other side of the injured person as close to him or her
},
{
    230.88,234.2
     as possible.
},
{
    234.2,238.24
     Direct all rescuers to reach across the injured person and grab a hold of the upper arm and
},
{
    238.24,243.56
     shoulder, the pelvis and the leg.
},
{
    243.56,250.6
     Roll the injured person upon the leader's call. Roll on three. Ready? One, two, three.
},
{
    250.6,265.0
     Direct the one remaining rescuer to place the spawn board to where the injured person was just Where are the person down? Only leaders call. Down on three.
},
{
    265.0,267.0
     One, two, three.
},
{
    274.0,276.0
     Slide down on three.
},
{
    278.0,280.0
     Justin, come over here.
},
{
    280.0,282.0
     Kelly, come over here.
},
{
    282.0,284.0
     Koya, slide down.
},
{
    286.0,288.0
     Slide down on three.
},
{
    288.0,290.0
     One, two, three.
},
{
    292.0,293.0
     Slide up on three.
},
{
    293.0,295.0
     One, two, three.
},
{
    310.48,311.64
     Removing the face mask allows rescue personnel to examine the airway and vital areas of the face.
},
{
    311.64,316.92
     It also allows them to administer pre-hospital care without removing the helmet.
},
{
    316.92,322.16
     The face mask should be removed in a timely manner without moving the head or neck.
},
{
    322.16,327.84
     Pruners, FM extractors, PVC pipe cutters, trainers, angels and screw drivers
},
{
    327.84,334.66
     can be used to remove the face mask, although screw drivers can be unreliable due to rusty
},
{
    334.66,340.84
     T-bolts and screws. If needed, a bag mask valve can be inserted under the face mask to provide
},
{
    340.84,346.14
     ventilation while the face mask is being removed.
},
{
    346.14,351.76
     If a physician or EMS personnel is available, a more definitive airway can be secured if
},
{
    351.76,355.58
     such intervention is necessary.
},
{
    355.58,360.26
     If the situation is not as urgent, a cervical collar can be placed on the athlete who then
},
{
    360.26,365.92
     is placed on a rigid spine board to ensure mobilization of all segmental levels.
},
{
    365.92,369.08
     This should only occur with athletes who are not wearing
},
{
    369.08,370.82
     helmets and shoulder pads.
},
{
    374.16,376.2
     Once the face mask has been removed,
},
{
    376.2,378.64
     the athlete must be prepared for transport.
},
{
    380.26,383.56
     Any injured athlete who may have a cervical spine injury
},
{
    383.56,386.0
     should be immobilized on a full body splint.
},
{
    387.0,396.0
     Techniques for spinal immobilization and the determination of whether inline stabilization is required for transport should be left to local protocols
},
{
    396.0,401.0
     or the clinical judgment and training of the individuals who are on site.
},
{
    402.0,407.0
     Positioning the head into a spine neutral position should be assessed on an individual
},
{
    407.16,413.76
     basis. The equipment used in splinting athletes with head and neck injuries will depend on
},
{
    413.76,419.92
     the appliances available as well as the training and knowledge of EMS personnel. Typical equipment
},
{
    419.92,425.0
     used includes the vacuum mattress and the rigid spine board.
},
{
    433.0,439.0
     The following are different techniques used for spine boarding and athlete with a cervical spine injury.
},
{
    443.0,445.6
     The lift technique.
},
{
    445.6,450.44
     A 6 plus person lift is recommended for all lifts.
},
{
    450.44,458.0
     There should be enough ATCs, MDs and EMS personnel to effectively administer a 6 plus person
},
{
    458.0,461.4
     lift.
},
{
    461.4,467.72
     You may need a 10 plus person lift for heavier individuals.
},
{
    467.72,472.12
     You can also use a 4 plus person lift for smaller athletes.
},
{
    472.12,481.2
     Lifting with fewer than 4 people is not recommended.
},
{
    481.2,488.0
     This step is omitted if you place the athlete on the spine board in the beginning.
},
{
    488.0,490.8
     The first medical personnel on the scene is the leader.
},
{
    490.8,494.62
     This person should issue all commands.
},
{
    494.62,497.68
     The leader should take control of the injured person's head.
},
{
    497.68,502.84
     The leader holds the head, with both hands stabilizing it, by holding firmly and allowing
},
{
    502.84,504.48
     no motion.
},
{
    504.48,508.36
     Position the other rescuers on one side of the injured person,
},
{
    508.36,513.9
     one of the chest, one of the pelvis, and one of the legs.
},
{
    513.9,516.24
     Place the spine board along the other side of the injured
},
{
    516.24,520.56
     person as close to him or her as possible.
},
{
    520.56,523.64
     Direct all rescuers to reach across the injured person
},
{
    523.64,529.0
     and grab a hold of the upper arm and shoulder, pelvis and leg.
},
{
    529.0,532.0
     One, two, three.
},
{
    535.0,538.0
     Down on one, two, three.
},
{
    542.0,546.6
     Once the athlete is on the spawn board, you can prepare the chest for early defibrillation
},
{
    546.6,550.48
     if needed.
},
{
    550.48,555.12
     With the helmet and shoulder pads in place, towels or other padding are sufficient to
},
{
    555.12,556.48
     fill the voids.
},
{
    556.48,560.42
     Once the athlete is secured to the long spawn board, the person at the head relinquishes
},
{
    560.42,565.6
     his or her control and the athlete is ready to be transported to an emergency medical
},
{
    565.6,569.32
     facility.
},
{
    569.32,573.12
     Neither the football pads nor the helmet should be removed before transportation unless the
},
{
    573.12,575.92
     football helmet does not fit snugly.
},
{
    575.92,580.88
     A properly fitted football helmet holds the head in a position of neutral spine alignment
},
{
    580.88,585.94
     when the athlete is wearing shoulder pads. Athletes who are vomiting
},
{
    585.94,589.84
     or bleeding from the oral cavity must be kept in prone or placed on their sides
},
{
    589.84,594.94
     to prevent aspirations of blood or vomit into the airway. This can be performed
},
{
    594.94,598.6
     after the athlete is mobilized.
},
{
    600.64,609.0
     Guidelines for helmet removal. Face mask cannot be removed to gain access to the airway.
},
{
    609.0,614.0
     Airway cannot be controlled or ventilation cannot be provided.
},
{
    614.0,618.0
     Mobilization of the helmet does not immobilize the head.
},
{
    618.0,623.0
     Helmet prevents mobilization for transport such as a bicycle helmet.
},
{
    623.0,628.0
     If the helmet is removed, spinal mobilization and alignment must be maintained
},
{
    628.0,634.0
     because any additional motion could cause further damage to the athlete with a cervical spine injury.
},
{
    635.0,642.0
     Helmet removal should never be attempted without thorough communication among all parties involved.
},
{
    643.0,645.76
     Any athlete suspected of having a spine injury
},
{
    645.76,647.96
     is to be transported by trained professionals
},
{
    647.96,649.68
     in an ambulance.
},
{
    649.68,651.44
     Transportation in a private vehicle
},
{
    651.44,653.56
     is never to be attempted.
},
{
    653.56,654.82
     In certain settings,
},
{
    654.82,656.6
     air transportation may be preferred
},
{
    656.6,658.14
     to ground transportation.
},
{
    659.08,663.12
     A trauma center should be the first choice destination
},
{
    663.12,665.04
     for spine injured athletes.
},
{
    665.04,668.92
     MDs, ATCs, and EMS personnel should be familiar
},
{
    668.92,671.3
     with local trauma networks and protocols.
},
{
    672.48,674.24
     In remote areas where it's quite a distance
},
{
    674.24,676.36
     to a trauma center, the physician may choose
},
{
    676.36,679.08
     to accompany the athlete to the hospital
},
{
    679.08,680.76
     and participate in the treatment.
},
{
    681.68,686.2
     When possible, the ATC should also accompany the athlete and assist in the
},
{
    686.2,690.52
     removal of protective athletic equipment.
},
{
    690.52,693.6
     Hopefully this video has been helpful for you in the management of the head, neck, and
},
{
    693.6,698.96
     your patient on the field of play. There are some new revolutionary treatments that we adopt
},
{
    698.96,703.24
     in these patients. You've heard of recent athletes receiving cold treatments into the
},
{
    703.24,706.12
     vascular system. You heard the use of
},
{
    706.12,711.88
     cortisone and sort of reducing the inflammation, hopefully lessening any head injury, swelling
},
{
    711.88,716.08
     and or neurological injury in the spine. And these are techniques that are applied in the
},
{
    716.08,720.96
     medical field. This video has gone over these various steps. I think probably it's very
},
{
    720.96,724.48
     important for any of you who are involved in the care of athletes to very carefully
},
{
    724.48,727.5
     understand the principles that we've here taught.
},
{
    727.5,730.3
     So good luck to you and take care of your athletes on the field of play.
