     Welcome back guys, I'm Nick from Active Chiropractic and I want to show you a squat exercise that
},
{
    9.36,11.72
     you can do almost anywhere and everywhere.
},
{
    11.72,15.22
     Now this exercise will definitely help you with your ankle mobility, knee mobility, hip
},
{
    15.22,19.82
     mobility and your lower back and strengthen these joints up and prevent back pain.
},
{
    19.82,23.44
     It will also preserve joint health.
},
{
    23.44,25.16
     Now this exercise will definitely help you
},
{
    25.16,26.4
     with the other sports as well,
},
{
    26.4,28.56
     so power lifting and weight lifting,
},
{
    28.56,30.08
     and also gymnastics.
},
{
    30.08,32.32
     If you're already doing Pilates or yoga,
},
{
    32.32,34.62
     this exercise might be too easy for you,
},
{
    34.62,37.96
     but it's also still a bit challenging for some people.
},
{
    37.96,41.08
     Now all you need to do is basically assume the position
},
{
    41.08,43.68
     of having your feet a bit wider than your shoulder
},
{
    43.68,50.1
     and sit back into it. And if you find it too easy and you're going a bit off balance, put your arms forward.
},
{
    50.1,52.8
     Rest them on your knees so you use it as a counterbalance.
},
{
    52.8,58.1
     If you're still finding this quite hard, use a heel lift so you can put a board under your heel.
},
{
    58.1,63.1
     What I'll use is basically a nice thick towel and I'll just sit on it.
},
{
    63.1,68.8
     What's so? If you're finding this exercise a bit too hard it's because your calf muscles are a bit
},
{
    68.8,72.24
     too tight so I do recommend you do some calf stretches.
},
{
    72.24,75.48
     There's dozens of types of calf stretches out there so you can look them up on YouTube
},
{
    75.48,76.48
     or Google.
},
{
    76.48,80.24
     Now, I recommend doing this exercise with your shoes off.
},
{
    80.24,84.24
     That way you can actually feel the ground and use a bit of proprioception and train your
},
{
    84.24,87.8
     body to feel where your body is.
},
{
    87.8,90.28
     Just another tip for you guys to open up the joints.
},
{
    90.28,94.72
     So put this arm, thread it through the inner part of your knee, put it towards the outside
},
{
    94.72,99.72
     of your foot, put your foot down, press your elbow into your knee and open up your chest.
},
{
    99.72,103.2
     Try to sit upright and it will open up your hips a lot more.
},
{
    103.2,109.16
     Just another thing I want you guys to do as well is actually leaning different angles in this position. So what I want you to do
},
{
    109.16,114.16
     is actually lean to side to side so let's say I'm leaning to 45 degrees all the way
},
{
    114.16,120.08
     there for about 10 to 30 seconds and then go to the other side as well. And then go
},
{
    120.08,126.48
     to more on a horizontal plane and hold there for about 20 or 30 seconds as well.
},
{
    126.48,128.2
     And then it goes to the other side.
},
{
    128.2,132.8
     Now that way it will open up a lot of your joints and stretch a lot of the muscles that
},
{
    132.8,136.84
     don't really get stressed in weight bearing.
},
{
    136.84,139.76
     Now another reason why this squat is very important.
},
{
    139.76,142.28
     So we were actually made to squat.
},
{
    142.28,146.48
     So for centuries, for example, especially in non-western societies
},
{
    146.92,153.72
     You would look around everyone's actually squatting and resting in that position and doing a lot of things on the floor in a
},
{
    153.72,159.82
     Squatting position even having a smoke in a squatting position eating a squatting position. It's seen almost everywhere
},
{
    159.82,163.1
     We were actually made to squat now in Western societies as well
},
{
    163.1,169.16
     If you look at little toddlers starting to walk and they actually sit in a squat position, we
},
{
    169.16,172.72
     were actually made to squat. So even them doing like number twos or poop-oos,
},
{
    172.72,179.2
     they actually do this in a squat position. So it's unfortunate that what we do as
},
{
    179.2,183.64
     for work, we tend to sit around the desk and we don't actually have this
},
{
    183.64,185.28
     mobility in our joints anymore
},
{
    185.28,187.84
     and we actually made ourselves immobile.
},
{
    187.84,189.92
     So it's very important to do this.
},
{
    189.92,196.0
     Now some studies do suggest that the squat actually prevents a lot of low back pain as
},
{
    196.0,197.0
     well.
},
{
    197.0,202.2
     I don't actually have the research papers handy but I'm definitely sure anecdotally
},
{
    202.2,203.36
     it's out there.
},
{
    203.36,206.52
     Now even for me, I see a lot of my relatives
},
{
    206.52,207.68
     that are over here now,
},
{
    207.68,209.8
     are starting to have a low back pain,
},
{
    209.8,213.2
     but my relatives overseas, obviously because I'm Asian,
},
{
    213.2,214.4
     they do a lot of squatting
},
{
    214.4,216.72
     and they don't seem to have much joint pain
},
{
    216.72,218.44
     or low back pain at all.
},
{
    218.44,219.28
