{
    22.0,25.8
     Now we're talking about shoulder and arm pain coming from the neck.
},
{
    25.8,28.68
     Right, exactly Bob, which is not unusual.
},
{
    28.68,30.48
     Right, not unusual, a lot of times you do get
},
{
    30.48,31.44
     the symptoms all the way down.

     There you go.
},
{
    68.24,69.08
     Okay.
},
{
    69.08,73.96
     All right, so symptoms in the shoulder and on the arm
},
{
    73.96,77.76
     can often be a result of a pinched nerve in the neck.
},
{
    77.76,80.6
     And those are the cases that we're talking about
},
{
    80.6,83.92
     where you can get some immediate relief.
},
{
    83.92,84.76
     We could do the right thing.
},
{
    84.76,86.6
     Right, we've got three options. That doesn't mean you're going get some immediate relief. We've got three options.
},
{
    86.6,89.2
     That doesn't mean you're going to get immediate relief
},
{
    89.2,90.64
     with one of these three, but it can.
},
{
    90.64,93.08
     And as a therapist, when this happens,
},
{
    93.08,95.32
     the patients absolutely love you.
},
{
    95.32,97.12
     And they say, how did you do that?
},
{
    97.12,98.72
     That's a good day.
},
{
    98.72,100.72
     Right, so we're gonna show you some secrets
},
{
    100.72,102.96
     that therapists know to help with these things.
},
{
    102.96,104.0
     It's a miracle in the clinic.
},
{
    104.0,105.16
     Yes, it is.
},
{
    105.16,108.92
     So the first one, okay, should we talk with just a little bit?
},
{
    108.92,110.24
     Why don't you sit down, Bob?
},
{
    110.24,111.08
     Sure.
},
{
    112.12,113.76
     Look at that, I just said why don't you sit down
},
{
    113.76,115.48
     and you immediately did it.
},
{
    115.48,117.24
     Do you act like that for your wife too, I bet.
},
{
    117.24,119.12
     Oh, I do, I listen to everybody.
},
{
    119.12,120.84
     So let's turn you this way.
},
{
    120.84,121.68
     Sure.
},
{
    121.68,127.26
     So the lower part of the neck is where some nerves come out and they go down through the
},
{
    127.26,129.46
     shoulders, down the arm, all the way to the hand.
},
{
    129.46,136.14
     And this is the area where if a nerve can get pinched, you'll get pain, numbness, tingling,
},
{
    136.14,140.1
     symptoms down in the shoulder, all the way down into the hand.
},
{
    140.1,145.76
     And this is one of the things, as I'm doing my screening, I'll check the cervical area,
},
{
    145.76,148.4
     and the first thing I'll do is I'll put
},
{
    148.4,151.44
     a real gentle pressure down on the head.
},
{
    151.44,154.96
     If they say, oh, that doesn't make anything feel any better,
},
{
    154.96,156.32
     I quit doing it immediately.
},
{
    156.32,157.52
     I don't push hard.
},
{
    157.52,158.68
     It might even make it worse.
},
{
    158.68,159.52
     Right.
},
{
    159.52,161.08
     Because you're squishing everything together,
},
{
    161.08,162.32
     and if the nerve's getting pinched,
},
{
    162.32,164.0
     it could be getting pinched even worse.
},
{
    164.0,165.6
     Pinched worse. Right.
},
{
    165.6,166.96
     So I'll have the person sit up tall.
},
{
    166.96,172.32
     I'll take my hand like this, go underneath the jaw, say Bob can you put your teeth together
},
{
    172.32,176.4
     gently so that we have a good solid mandible foundation.
},
{
    176.4,180.56
     This hand's going to go under the axoput, the bump right here and I'm just going to
},
{
    180.56,183.6
     gently pull up, up, up.
},
{
    183.6,185.18
     I'll hold it for a few seconds.
},
{
    185.18,187.9
     I'm gonna go down, ask what the results are.
},
{
    187.9,190.58
     Now this is where when the pressure is going on,
},
{
    190.58,192.58
     they'll say, patient will say,
},
{
    192.58,194.22
     boy, when the pressure is on,
},
{
    194.22,195.74
     my arms start feeling better.
},
{
    195.74,197.82
     It'll happen just like that.
},
{
    197.82,199.46
     Not always, but when it does,
},
{
    199.46,200.74
     then you know you're on to something.
},
{
    200.74,202.7
     Your traction is probably gonna be
},
{
    202.7,204.62
     a great option for treatment.
},
{
    204.62,208.68
     So then we've got another one laying down and also there's some other options.
},
{
    208.68,213.2
     But I'm going to go to what I'll do next.
},
{
    213.2,214.56
     Cervical extension?
},
{
    214.56,219.12
     Cervical extension is a McKenzie technique, Rob and the McKenzie therapist who's really
},
{
    219.12,228.64
     done a lot with therapy and this is one of his techniques. I'll take a towel roll and put it there for support.
},
{
    230.76,233.96
     And Bob, you wanna lean back up against the chair
},
{
    233.96,236.32
     and we may do a gentle chin tuck
},
{
    236.32,238.48
     and I'll say, support in your neck.
},
{
    238.48,240.92
     See how far back you can look.
},
{
    240.92,242.4
     So I'm gonna pull down a little bit.
},
{
    242.4,244.36
     Yup, give a little support there.
},
{
    244.36,246.08
     And I'm gonna start to work my way back.
},
{
    246.08,247.72
     Now I may only get so far.
},
{
    247.72,248.56
     Right.
},
{
    248.56,250.52
     And it might start making the pain worse.
},
{
    250.52,251.36
     That's fine.
},
{
    251.36,252.2
     Right.
},
{
    252.2,254.52
     You know, work in the area that allows you to work.
},
{
    254.52,257.96
     If it lets you go this far, do repeated ones
},
{
    257.96,259.9
     just in this range.
},
{
    259.9,262.28
     And this might be the first day, that's all you can do.
},
{
    262.28,263.12
     Sure.
},
{
    264.08,265.96
     And then eventually hopefully you can start going
},
{
    265.96,266.96
     further and further.
},
{
    266.96,270.08
     You wanna be able to get as far back as you can.
},
{
    270.08,272.32
     That's generally when the magic happens,
},
{
    272.32,273.6
     as McKenzie says.
},
{
    273.6,276.68
     But I have had it on the first day, the first session,
},
{
    276.68,278.88
     I'll have the person go like this,
},
{
    278.88,280.52
     and the first time it kinda hurts,
},
{
    280.52,283.08
     and they'll repeat it three or four times,
},
{
    283.08,285.8
     and all of a sudden they see my arms starting to feel better. If that's the case, then I say, let's repeat it more and they'll repeat it three or four times and all of a sudden they see my arms starting to feel better.
},
{
    285.8,287.52
     If that's the case, then I say,
},
{
    287.52,289.08
     let's repeat it more and more.
},
{
    289.08,292.08
     We may do up to 10 or 15 repetitions
},
{
    292.08,294.0
     and if the neck starts to go back farther,
},
{
    294.0,297.76
     like Bob is showing and the arm is clearly getting better
},
{
    297.76,299.72
     and if you say the patient will say,
},
{
    299.72,301.48
     boy, my fingers feel good now.
},
{
    301.48,305.92
     All the way up into my elbow, then that's the really-
},
{
    305.92,307.68
     One thing I tend to do Brad is,
},
{
    307.68,310.32
     because let's say this is the bad arm,
},
{
    310.32,314.36
     I'll grab with just one arm, one arm, the towel too.
},
{
    314.36,316.36
     So this one's not having to do the work.
},
{
    316.36,319.6
     Yeah, because I can kind of mask the symptoms a little bit.
},
{
    319.6,321.36
     So I'll do this.
},
{
    321.36,324.8
     Sometimes I'll even do this.
},
{
    324.8,326.4
     I'll pull up like this and go,
},
{
    326.4,328.4
     that's gonna throw my mic off.
},
{
    328.4,331.44
     As a therapist sometimes, if things are going really well
},
{
    331.44,334.28
     and they say, I say, well, maybe it'll work better
},
{
    334.28,336.32
     if I'm holding onto this event.
},
{
    336.32,337.16
     I've done that too.
},
{
    337.16,338.32
     And I'll do this.
},
{
    338.32,340.52
     I don't recommend anybody at home doing that.
},
{
    340.52,342.64
     That's just something that you need to be trained,
},
{
    342.64,344.12
     you need some experience.
},
{
    344.12,345.44
     However,
},
{
    350.72,351.36
     and then the next one, if I'm going to go, I went back to this before, if the cervical traction
},
{
    356.48,359.28
     shows some immediate relief in the arm, then I might have the person lay down on the table
},
{
    366.04,370.52
     and sometimes just changing position like this, getting the weight of the head going through the neck, the arm will feel better just from the position change.
},
{
    370.52,373.04
     And it may or may not.
},
{
    373.04,376.16
     What I'm gonna do now is same thing as before.
},
{
    376.16,379.12
     Seated cervical traction, I'm gonna do supine
},
{
    379.12,381.48
     or laying on your back cervical traction.
},
{
    381.48,387.94
     And I'm gonna do that by putting my hand right here Again under that accident that's the big bone right above your neck
},
{
    387.94,393.76
     And then Bob is gonna close his teeth gently and I'm gonna come here and very gently
},
{
    394.48,398.84
     Pull some traction and what I say is because it's hard to talk when I'm doing this
},
{
    399.16,405.54
     Bob if you have any problems and things are painful, just wave your hand or kind of say,
},
{
    405.54,409.56
     hmm, yeah, thumbs are up if things are going good.
},
{
    409.56,412.92
     So if I do this and I hold it for five or 10 seconds
},
{
    412.92,416.44
     and thumbs are up, then I'm gonna hold it up to 30 seconds
},
{
    416.44,418.48
     as long as thumb stays up.
},
{
    418.48,420.36
     And then I'm gonna take it off
},
{
    420.36,424.16
     and I'm only gonna do that again if thumb stays up
},
{
    424.16,426.72
     and I'll say, Bob, how does your arm feel now?
},
{
    426.72,427.64
     It feels better.
},
{
    427.64,429.16
     And then I'll wait a couple of minutes.
},
{
    429.16,430.22
     Does it still feel better?
},
{
    430.22,433.28
     If it still feels better, then I may repeat that.
},
{
    433.28,436.92
     Only doing it if it's clearly making the arm feel better.
},
{
    436.92,439.78
     Again, sometimes that happens just like that.
},
{
    439.78,441.32
     Other times there are some other options
},
{
    441.32,443.24
     that the therapist has to work with.
},
{
    443.24,445.08
     And when I do this, Brad,
},
{
    445.08,448.56
     my idea here is eventually we want to get to the extension.
},
{
    448.56,449.4
     Right.
},
{
    449.4,453.12
     I mean, I do this, especially maybe if the extension
},
{
    453.12,455.44
     is not working, right away to start off.
},
{
    455.44,456.4
     I'll do a little bit of this,
},
{
    456.4,458.16
     and then I'll go back to the extension
},
{
    458.16,459.96
     and see if we can do it now.
},
{
    459.96,462.16
     Because the end goal, to me,
},
{
    462.16,465.2
     the end goal to make this go away is to do the extensions.
},
{
    465.2,470.4
     Right. I mean, typically when the arm gets better, the extension, the range of motion improves.
},
{
    470.96,476.4
     So again, this can be one of those things that works out very well, very quickly. Other times
},
{
    476.4,481.6
     you have to work into a little bit. And oftentimes some of these things, you need a therapist,
},
{
    481.6,486.36
     an experienced therapist to do it. But. Yeah, this will give you the option
},
{
    486.36,488.84
     of maybe seeking out a therapist
},
{
    488.84,490.4
     that's trained in the McKenzie Method.
},
{
    490.4,491.24
     Right.
},
{
    491.24,492.08
     And we actually have a video on that
},
{
    492.08,495.2
     on how to find a McKenzie therapist.
},
{
    495.2,496.44
     Right, because they're throughout the world.
},
{
    496.44,497.68
     It's a worldwide system.
},
{
    497.68,499.84
     Yeah, 36 countries, I think they're in.
},
{
    499.84,502.08
     I think it's up to 38 miles, couldn't be more.
},
{
    502.08,503.96
     But you just, you type in where you live
},
{
    503.96,505.92
     and it'll pop up where these therapists are for you more. But you just, you type in where you live and they all, you know, it'll pop up
},
{
    505.92,507.84
     where these therapists are for you to.
},
{
    507.84,509.56
     So yeah, if you type in Bob and Brad
},
{
    509.56,510.8
     and type in Mackenzie.
},
{
    510.8,511.64
     Yep.
},
{
    511.64,513.96
     M-C-K-E-N-Z-I-E.
},
{
    513.96,515.12
     I believe you're exactly right.
},
{
    515.12,516.64
     Your spelling is getting better, Bob.
