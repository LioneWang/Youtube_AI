     Hi guys, it's Dr. Shayla here. Today we're going to be talking about the second time around,
},
{
    6.0,11.44
     or it might be your third pregnancy, or your fourth, or your fifth. Either way, when it comes to
},
{
    11.44,15.76
     subsequent pregnancies, what I tend to hear from my patients is that they're kind of feeling
},
{
    15.76,20.56
     similar things, but they happen a little bit earlier than they did the last time, and that does tend
},
{
    20.56,25.12
     to happen with subsequent pregnancies. One of the more pressing concerns that my patients have
},
{
    25.12,26.94
     is with round ligament pain.
},
{
    26.94,29.72
     I'm gonna show you a way today to massage
},
{
    29.72,31.42
     and treat this ligament at home.
},
{
    31.42,33.24
     You can do this both preventatively,
},
{
    33.24,36.3
     as well as reactively if it is irritating you.
},
{
    36.3,38.48
     First things first, we gotta find our round ligaments.
},
{
    38.48,40.6
     So where are they?
},
{
    40.6,43.0
     The thing about the round ligament is that it moves
},
{
    43.0,45.6
     and changes orientation as your pregnancy advances.
},
{
    45.6,50.4
     So it's not going to be in the same position in your first trimester as it is in your second trimester.
},
{
    50.4,54.4
     So for the purposes of this video, I'm going to show you a way to map it out on your body
},
{
    54.4,57.2
     and you're going to find the round ligament somewhere in that area.
},
{
    57.2,59.2
     So first let's map out this triangle.
},
{
    60.2,66.36
     You're going to find your pubic bone, your belly button, and this sharp point in your
},
{
    66.36,68.26
     hip or your hip pointer.
},
{
    68.26,71.62
     Your round ligament will be in this triangle.
},
{
    71.62,76.28
     The best way to massage this area is lying flat on your back with your feet on the floor
},
{
    76.28,78.68
     and your knees bent up.
},
{
    78.68,82.68
     Best time to do it is first thing in the morning before you even roll out of bed.
},
{
    82.68,90.56
     You're going to want to put a little bit of oil on your fingers to do this. You're going to find your triangle and start with I like to do
},
{
    90.56,96.32
     little circular motions through this triangle. You may find a more tender point. When you find that
},
{
    96.32,100.4
     point you can concentrate and spend a little bit more time there. You can also do some downward
},
{
    100.4,105.32
     sweeping motions if you find a spot that's more tender too.
},
{
    109.16,109.4
     You want to spend about two to three minutes per side working on this area.
},
{
    113.64,113.66
     Best case scenario every morning before you get out of bed. As always,
},
{
    116.32,116.48
