     Bob and Brad, the two most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    10.2,15.5
     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist, Brad Heineck physical therapist, we're the most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    15.5,17.56
     In our opinion of course, I'm like superheroes
},
{
    17.64,19.38
     Yeah
},
{
    19.38,25.4
     Today we're gonna talk about immediate relief and self-treatment of the sacroiliac joint or the SI joint
},
{
    25.4,30.56
     We're gonna show you where it is and we're gonna show you some things to try because
},
{
    31.0,37.42
     We're not gonna have you try to diagnose what you have specifically going on with it because it's too difficult for you to do that
},
{
    37.58,40.64
     But we can show you things to try and if it takes away your pain
},
{
    41.36,46.02
     Hey, say it'll be, say it'll be. And these treatments, they're gonna, when they work, they work right now
},
{
    46.02,50.88
     And you're gonna feel that pain come down. If they don't, they don't or sometimes it irritates a little bit
},
{
    50.88,55.0
     Then you're gonna stop those, we'll clarify that and so make sure you wait for that
},
{
    55.0,58.84
     But Bob has something to mention to everyone. Yeah, in case you are new to our channel
},
{
    58.84,63.48
     Please take a second to subscribe to us. We provide videos on how to stay healthy, fit, pain-free and we upload every day
},
{
    63.88,65.92
     Also Brad's gonna do his job here
},
{
    66.32,69.68
     Go over to the Facebook and like us because Brad and I as children
},
{
    70.4,75.82
     It's sad, you're cheering up a little bit. We're not liked and now we're trying to turn things around so you go to Bob and Brad
},
{
    75.82,78.88
     There you go Bob and Brad and now SI information
},
{
    79.6,87.0
     Sacred Iliac Bob, that's a big term and it really I think is kind of throws people up because I've heard some people
},
{
    87.16,91.4
     Think that their back pain is sacroiliac just because it sounds like well
},
{
    91.4,96.76
     I'm having sacroiliac pain, it's really their back, but it is often in that same region
},
{
    97.04,101.4
     Sure, that's why people it could be, should we use Sam to help?
},
{
    101.4,107.6
     So the SI joint, sacroiliac, the word comes from here's the sacrum and here's the
},
{
    107.6,113.44
     ileum the sacrum is a triangle shaped bone big solid one there right at your buttocks
},
{
    113.44,116.64
     two pelvis is kind of on each side of it so that's the ileum
},
{
    116.64,121.92
     you're right and so the joint is right here it's where the two bones connect it's not a joint that
},
{
    121.92,126.32
     moves very much at all and that's controversial in the medical field
},
{
    126.32,130.52
     We're not gonna get into that. There's a lot of big heavy ligaments that are holding it in place
},
{
    130.52,137.28
     Right, so it's if you see an anatomical picture of it you'd see why it doesn't move much
},
{
    137.56,142.82
     We think there is some movement. Okay, so that's the SI joint
},
{
    142.82,149.68
     Now this is gonna be something new for Liz, we're gonna, can you zoom in right in here?
},
{
    149.92,156.72
     So here if you can see Bob, can you hold the sacrum? Sometimes Liz we have to be at a certain distance from you, does this work out okay?
},
{
    156.72,162.9
     We're gonna ignore the nerves and get that out of the way, so here's the sacrum and here is the elium now the joint
},
{
    162.96,164.96
     Now this is what can happen
},
{
    164.44,165.1
     And here is the helium now the joint now. This is what can happen
},
{
    170.0,174.84
     There can be slight movement in there and actually I would actually show that from the side too Brad Good idea. This can see how that rotates so it can be rotated back
},
{
    175.56,179.58
     That's a posterior. It kind of stuck that way or rotated forward and kind of stuck that way
},
{
    179.58,184.24
     So we're gonna try getting some movement in there to see if that relieves your pain, right?
},
{
    184.36,185.5
     So that's what these
},
{
    185.5,190.52
     exercises are gonna do specifically and if you get it to move the right direction the pain is
},
{
    190.52,194.56
     gonna drop right down you're gonna feel it. So I think the other thing we should mention while
},
{
    194.56,199.56
     we're here Brad is what are some of the causes of this? Good real good point. It's like if you're
},
{
    199.56,210.92
     walking and you will back up again. Inadvertently step off of a curve and you come down real hard and it puts a jolt through that that can take that joint and rotate it
},
{
    210.92,215.86
     So if you as a matter of habit are always sitting like let's say
},
{
    216.04,219.94
     You sit with you even your legs crossed and you're always putting weight on one side
},
{
    219.94,224.76
     Yep, you know year after year after year you're actually putting stress on the you know
},
{
    224.76,228.56
     The iliums different in a different way and it can actually cause a little bit of rotation
},
{
    229.28,234.48
     If you're a car accident and you get the that your knee goes into the dashboard if you had a
},
{
    235.0,240.96
     That kind of force into that that can shift the SI joint if you have one leg longer than the other
},
{
    241.0,245.12
     There you go that that can actually often I see that quite often in people that are
},
{
    245.64,249.58
     That have you know, especially if it's like more than a half inch. Sure
},
{
    249.58,254.72
     It can really make a difference. Or you get a total knee and maybe they didn't quite get them right and all of a sudden
},
{
    254.72,257.72
     You have a sudden change and you got a shorter leg after surgery
},
{
    257.72,262.84
     And one of the more common ones which Liz our camera woman can attest to is when you're pregnant
},
{
    262.84,266.14
     Right. There's those chemicals that help loosen up the ligaments, right?
},
{
    266.14,270.18
     And it makes them easier to rotate and cause you problems.
},
{
    270.18,271.18
     Chemicals?
},
{
    271.18,273.18
     No, body chemicals.
},
{
    273.18,275.18
     They call hormones.
},
{
    275.18,278.68
     Yeah, well, that just, you know what I'm saying.
},
{
    278.68,280.18
     You're a chemical, aren't you?
},
{
    280.18,281.18
     I would imagine that.
},
{
    281.18,284.18
     It just sounds better to be hormones.
},
{
    284.18,289.3
     Now let's say, as a matter of fact, this just happened me two weeks ago in the clinic and it works so well
},
{
    289.3,291.94
     It's like man, we got to get this out to our viewers
},
{
    292.64,298.56
     She had back pain typically if it's SI it's when you walk or put weight through it is when it's worse
},
{
    298.8,302.16
     When you sit down typically feels better or laying down
},
{
    302.56,308.48
     So this feels worse, stairs are worse, right that weight bearing putting force making that SI
},
{
    308.48,315.74
     Get pushed and painful pain is typically here. It can go down the leg usually not below the knee
},
{
    316.32,321.2
     I've seen it referring to the groin too Brad. Sure wrap around there. Yeah. Yeah, so
},
{
    321.6,322.88
     So
},
{
    322.88,324.56
     With that in mind
},
{
    324.56,327.52
     This is what you're gonna do if your symptoms sound like that
},
{
    328.36,332.4
     You may to have an incident of the causes that we mentioned
},
{
    332.4,337.0
     This is what your first thing you're gonna do is I wish I had a chair Bob here
},
{
    339.16,342.4
     We're really prepared here today. Well, it's not far away Bob
},
{
    342.4,347.04
     Okay, if you're in a nice firm chair, you don't want to do this on a couch or some
},
{
    347.88,356.18
     soft chair like that, good firm chair with good posture. If you take your knee up and lift it and say this is a painful side
},
{
    356.18,358.98
     This is called a muscle energy technique in the therapy world
},
{
    358.98,365.52
     I'm gonna push down and hold it and actually do a nice symmetric and this patient that I had just a couple weeks ago
},
{
    366.08,372.32
     she did this immediately, she's a boy that feels good, I mean it was very clear, so her home exercise
},
{
    372.32,378.16
     program was to do this hold it for about five seconds and relax. So how often were you having to
},
{
    378.16,382.32
     do that Brad? I told her to do it every one to two hours, sure you know and that's the thing is you
},
{
    382.32,386.26
     don't just do it once a day You're doing this constantly to try to help
},
{
    386.82,390.8
     Gradually adjust that so that it stays back in place and feels better
},
{
    390.84,397.94
     So you know she came back and it was working but it kind of plateaued it got about 50% better so then
},
{
    399.2,402.96
     The next thing you can do and if that one doesn't work you could go to this and
},
{
    405.2,407.2
     You go to the side of the bed
},
{
    407.52,414.28
     Don't fall off. Yeah, don't fall off you take the painful side and you gently let it down on the side of the bed and
},
{
    414.8,416.8
     Then we're stretching
},
{
    417.0,421.8
     Technically we're trying to get a posterior tilt into an anterior tilt with both of these techniques
},
{
    421.8,425.48
     Don't worry about that if you do this and this is her situation
},
{
    425.72,430.56
     This just felt good. She just said oh that's good. You'd probably want to lock it in place
},
{
    430.56,433.22
     Yeah, that's a good point
},
{
    433.22,438.68
     Yeah, you want to hold on to that knee and let this one hang down and that's gonna help again
},
{
    439.2,445.68
     Adjust that SI right it's something you try and see if it feels better and if it doesn't if it hurts
},
{
    445.68,448.24
     You don't do it, you just scratch it, especially if it makes it worse
},
{
    448.24,452.88
     Right, we've got two other ones that you're gonna try, both of those don't give you that immediate relief
},
{
    452.96,454.96
     Then you go ahead and go to this one
},
{
    455.04,461.16
     Actually, you can stay laying in the bed, to me sometimes Brad is that if this actually makes it worse
},
{
    461.6,465.68
     I'm sometimes happy about that because that means maybe if I go to the other side
},
{
    465.68,468.16
     It's gonna make it better. Precisely. Yeah
},
{
    469.04,473.0
     So this I'm still on the same leg. That's a painful side those two
},
{
    473.48,478.36
     Techniques didn't work. I'm gonna take this knee bring it up to my shoulder and
},
{
    479.12,483.36
     Then I'm gonna hold it and I'm gonna take my knee and push it that direction
},
{
    484.0,489.52
     While I hold it. So we're actually doing an isometric another muscle energy technique hold and push
},
{
    490.24,495.88
     And if that feels like good pressure feels good, I've got an SI problem on my right side
},
{
    495.88,502.76
     That's feeling good right now, and I do these two on myself on a regular basis
},
{
    502.76,508.32
     I actually like to go around like this because you're a little more stable and then push like that
},
{
    508.32,510.32
     But it doesn't matter whatever makes you feel better
},
{
    510.48,513.08
     You can take this leg and put it down or here
},
{
    513.08,518.28
     Which ever works better gives you better results and again you're gonna hold it three to five seconds
},
{
    518.28,521.08
     So again if he wasn't holding that knee would come right down, right
},
{
    522.4,526.8
     So I'm gonna do that three times and then you're gonna repeat that throughout the day
},
{
    526.8,532.64
     again once every one to two hours until you reach a plateau with your progress and hopefully it'll
},
{
    532.64,541.52
     be gone. There is one other one that's similar to that. Is that the stool one Brad? You can do
},
{
    541.52,546.24
     this on steps because it's a different height and if you got a rail to grab on
},
{
    546.24,549.44
     It can help she even do it better
},
{
    549.44,552.52
     This is a little high for me, but it gives you the right idea
},
{
    552.68,555.72
     So you're gonna go up there and if you do it on a stairwell
},
{
    555.72,559.68
     You're gonna hold on to the rail and then you just lean into it and once again
},
{
    559.68,561.68
     It should feel like oh, this is a good stretch
},
{
    562.0,569.56
     It's making that pain feel better and then when you're done you walk around it also should feel better then you know
},
{
    569.56,574.2
     you're right on so there you got four different options for SI joint pain that
},
{
    574.2,578.92
     are gonna immediately cause relief if it's the right one so and then you can
},
{
    578.92,584.8
     also try basically if you want to try a belt an SI belt you can give that a go
},
{
    584.8,589.7
     just happen to have one Bob and basically what you're trying to do is you're trying to hold the pelvis together
},
{
    589.7,594.72
     And this is again in those cases where the hormones are taking place and
},
{
    596.08,601.86
     You're pregnant now Liz, she's had a couple children and she has one that she has to watch in addition to that
},
{
    602.5,605.6
     Alex I always like that joke. Yeah, that's her husband by the way
},
{
    605.92,609.08
     But she tried it and you had good success with it, right Liz?
},
{
    609.08,613.68
     You didn't have this one, but she had one that was made for a pregnant woman, right
},
{
    613.88,619.4
     So it puts force around here and stabilizes those joints
},
{
    619.54,629.12
     So the way I determined whether or not it might help someone is I actually go up to the person No, Brad, and yeah, and I actually push on their pelvis and I have them walk
},
{
    629.36,631.36
     And I know this is kind of a goofy thing to do
},
{
    631.36,636.88
     But you walk behind someone and and if that gives them relief then there's a good shot that the the belt's gonna help
},
{
    636.88,639.52
     All right, so you get one of these SI belts
},
{
    640.24,645.54
     And you put it on here and it has to be on the pelvis not too high in the waistline
},
{
    645.54,647.54
     The pelvis is right here
},
{
    647.54,650.56
     It starts right here, so it's below the pelvis
},
{
    650.56,654.06
     And you can tighten it up from both sides you get it nice and snug
},
{
    654.46,659.94
     Should feel good and then you wear it throughout the day and a lot of times you know once you get it calm down
},
{
    659.94,662.9
     It stays calm down, you know, that's the whole idea
},
{
    662.9,668.0
     You know when things get inflamed it can be very difficult to get that inflammation to come down
},
{
    668.0,673.64
     So that's why this can help. So a lot of different options and once again Bob
},
{
    673.64,679.32
     I really like to tell everyone here we can fix just about anything throughout the body except for a broken heart
},
{
    679.32,686.8
     There you go, but we're working on it. We can give you advice too on if you're a loved and you're having trouble finding it. Well, we could it might not be good advice.
},
{
    686.8,690.36
     It's not good advice, but we can give advice. So thanks for watching.
},
