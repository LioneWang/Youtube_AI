     Hi, I'm captain Joe Bruni and what I'm going to go over and discuss is how to stop severe bleeding
},
{
    10.02,15.38
     When an injury occurs severe bleeding can cause a great deal of excitement
},
{
    15.38,20.54
     Not only for the victim but for the bystanders who are going to perform first aid
},
{
    21.32,26.76
     The key is to take some type of sterile dressing found in a first aid kit
},
{
    26.76,33.76
     or very clean cloth material and place over the injured site and apply pressure. Pressure
},
{
    34.54,41.38
     in that area will help to stop the bleeding from occurring. With a significant amount
},
{
    41.38,48.0
     of pressure, if that does not stop the bleeding, then the next step would be to raise
},
{
    48.0,53.0
     the injured limb above the person's heart or head
},
{
    53.0,58.0
     and possibly applying pressure to an artery
},
{
    58.0,60.0
     located in the general vicinity
},
{
    60.0,71.0
     to help slow down the blood flow to that injured site. Constant pressure in that area should help to reduce and stop bleeding.
},
{
    71.0,80.0
     Also, some type of cling or wrap can be used to wrap the pressure bandage in place
},
{
    80.0,87.8
     and hold it while continued pressure is applied. After the cling, you may even
},
{
    87.8,93.9
     want to consider some type of elastic or pressure bandage while continuing to hold pressure
},
{
    93.9,100.76
     in that area until the individual can be taken to an emergency department to receive sutures
},
{
    100.76,108.0
     to stop bleeding and to begin the process of healing. Severe bleeding can cause a great deal of excitement,
},
{
    108.0,111.0
     not only for the victim, but for the rescuer themselves.
},
{
    111.0,114.0
     I'm Captain Joe Bruni. Stay safe and we'll see you next time.
