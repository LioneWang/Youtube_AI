     In this video, I'm going to show how to get rid of neck pain from sleeping wrong using just a
},
{
    5.2,11.6
     simple dish towel. So if you just woke up with a kink of the neck, a lot of pinching pain going on,
},
{
    11.6,18.48
     dullness, achiness, you name it, this is a really great way to be able to relieve it very quickly.
},
{
    18.48,29.96
     It's a self-mobilization technique that is going to focus on all of the motions of the neck. That is rotation or twisting the head to look over your shoulder, bending kind of like
},
{
    29.96,35.48
     taking your ear to your shoulder, and then forward flexion and extension. And
},
{
    35.48,39.56
     I'm going to break it down into three phases that will target each of those
},
{
    39.56,44.16
     motions of the neck. So with the first part we're going to focus on rotation.
},
{
    44.16,48.46
     We're going to take our towel, roll it up and just place it on the shoulders for now. Find the
},
{
    48.46,53.58
     spot that really is achy and causing a lot of pain. What you're going to do is
},
{
    53.58,57.86
     take the towel and place it over the level of that spot and just put a little
},
{
    57.86,62.78
     bit of pull in there. Whatever side that it's on is the side that you're going to
},
{
    62.78,65.28
     then lower and lock that down towards
},
{
    65.28,66.4
     the chest.
},
{
    66.4,70.52
     The opposite side, so in this case my left side's hurting, my right hand is what's going
},
{
    70.52,71.96
     to do all the work.
},
{
    71.96,77.28
     I'm going to just slowly try to rotate or twist the head towards the left until I feel
},
{
    77.28,79.44
     a very good stretch.
},
{
    79.44,80.8
     Don't force this one.
},
{
    80.8,83.52
     Just go to the point where you feel a good stretch.
},
{
    83.52,89.0
     Hold that for about 10 to 15 seconds. come back and then just keep repeating it. Go a little bit further
},
{
    89.0,93.16
     each time you do until you feel like you have a lot more motion in there and the
},
{
    93.16,97.96
     neck is starting to have a lot more mobility into it. So if you are having a
},
{
    97.96,101.96
     lot of pinching pain going on, we can take this stretch to the next level by
},
{
    101.96,109.56
     doing a self-traction in there. This one we're going to cross the arms. Whatever arm is on top you're going to
},
{
    109.56,113.88
     then go up diagonally so almost towards your eyes. You want to lock the bottom
},
{
    113.88,120.8
     hand and then take this hand upwards with it almost towards the eyes. Again hold
},
{
    120.8,124.84
     this one for 10 to 15 seconds in a spot you feel comfortable and just keep
},
{
    124.84,125.82
     repeating it.
},
{
    125.82,130.98
     You should almost feel an upward traction into the neck and that will help relieve a pinch
},
{
    130.98,131.98
     nerve.
},
{
    131.98,132.98
     Give it a try.
},
{
    132.98,135.36
     So for phase two, we're going to focus on lateral bending.
},
{
    135.36,137.16
     That is taking the ear to the shoulder.
},
{
    137.16,138.24
     I'm going to take my towel.
},
{
    138.24,142.76
     I'm just going to then throw it completely over that left shoulder, assuming that I'm
},
{
    142.76,144.04
     having left-sided pain.
},
{
    144.04,148.52
     So whatever side pain you're having, just throw that towel on that side. Next I'm going to reach
},
{
    148.52,153.48
     backwards. I'm going to grab the end of that towel and then I'm going to take the
},
{
    153.48,157.88
     other end and go diagonally with it. So I want to go across my chest towards the
},
{
    157.88,163.16
     right side. I try to line it up with the spot in the neck that is really feeling
},
{
    163.16,169.22
     a lot of discomfort. So I'm going to go right over that spot, pull it over towards the right, and from here,
},
{
    169.22,174.6
     what I'm going to do next is then bend away while putting pressure into that towel.
},
{
    174.6,177.76
     And this is a really good, intense stretch.
},
{
    177.76,180.44
     I hold that one for about 10 to 15 seconds.
},
{
    180.44,185.36
     I come back up and then just keep repeating it and try to go a little bit further each time.
},
{
    185.36,188.96
     Just keep repeating it until you feel that spot finally release and
},
{
    189.72,196.08
     then you can kind of just keep moving up or down as needed to hit any other spots that you might have. With phase 3
},
{
    196.08,200.08
     we're going to focus on forward bending and backwards extension.
},
{
    200.16,206.44
     So take the towel and then just pull it tight across the back of the neck right here.
},
{
    206.44,211.36
     And what you're going to do is just slowly lean the head back into extension to your
},
{
    211.36,212.68
     comfort level.
},
{
    212.68,218.56
     And just hold that for about 5 to 10 seconds, come back up and then go into a chin tuck.
},
{
    218.56,225.12
     And then continually do that until you feel like that motion starts to improve.
},
{
    225.12,229.56
     You can also move the towel up and down to your comfort levels to target different spots.
},
{
    229.56,232.84
