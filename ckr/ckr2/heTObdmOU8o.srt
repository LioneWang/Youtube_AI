     Bone densitometry, or dual x-ray absorptiometry, is a radiological technique using low-intensity X-rays.
},

    26.6,33.72
     It measures the bone mineral content in grams per surface area unit in square centimeters.

     Bone mineral density increases from birth until the age of 20 to 25, then remains stable

     until the age of 35 to 40, and then progressively diminishes. Osteoporosis is a skeletal disease characterized by low bone mineral density and progressive

     deterioration of the bone tissue's micro-architecture, with an increasing fracture risk.
},
{
    57.32,62.76
     Therefore, it is important to both measure bone mineral density as well as to determine

     Osteoporosis develops silently until one day a fracture may occur,

     We usually scan three different areas of the body,
