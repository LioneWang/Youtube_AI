     Hi, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.
},
{
    3.72,4.72
     Brad Heineck, physical therapist.
},
{
    4.72,7.36
     Together we are the most famous physical therapists on the internet.
},
{
    7.36,8.76
     In our opinion, of course, Bob.
},
{
    8.76,12.0
     Brad, I can't believe we haven't done this video yet, but we need to do a video on an
},
{
    12.0,15.76
     effective self-treatment for golfer's elbow.
},
{
    15.76,16.76
     Golfer's elbow.
},
{
    16.76,18.76
     Or medial epicondylitis for the non-later.
},
{
    18.76,22.16
     All right, basically you're going to have pain on your inner elbow.
},
{
    22.16,23.16
     Okay.
},
{
    23.16,26.48
     That's what you're gonna have pain on your inner elbow, okay? You're gonna have it quite often this could be from doing the forearms
},
{
    26.9,31.76
     Forehead smack forehand forehand smash in tennis sure forehead and
},
{
    32.48,35.34
     Or you could obviously get it from golf sure
},
{
    35.88,38.84
     You could get actually get tennis elbow and golfers elbow in
},
{
    39.6,43.1
     Golf sure I believe it. Yeah. Well the way you swing
},
{
    44.04,46.0
     I Sure, I believe it. Well, do a U-swing. I actually got this.
},
{
    46.0,51.0
     I was working on a project when we could use our cordless drill and a lot of hand, you know,
},
{
    51.0,53.0
     and I don't do a lot of hand work during the week,
},
{
    53.0,56.0
     and so I did so much, it's like, oh, and it's very tender.
},
{
    56.0,57.0
     That's a very good example.
},
{
    57.0,64.0
     A lot of gripping exercise we'll do it because the muscle wall there actually does control that gripping.
},
{
    64.0,65.32
     Right.
},
{
    65.32,67.7
     So a lot of times you're going to have, let's say it's my right arm, you're going to have
},
{
    67.7,71.92
     pain when you bring your wrist down like this and if I give resistance or if you go
},
{
    71.92,72.92
     this way.
},
{
    72.92,73.92
     Right.
},
{
    73.92,77.36
     So anyway, the pain, this is going to show you one treatment you can do and this is all
},
{
    77.36,79.52
     the most effective treatment you can do.
},
{
    79.52,81.2
     We actually put a dot here.
},
{
    81.2,83.88
     So quite often the pain is right in through here.
},
{
    83.88,91.68
     You might feel it coming down even. And you're going to do cross fiber friction massage, cross fiber meaning across the fibers
},
{
    91.68,92.68
     of the muscle.
},
{
    92.68,97.68
     Right so the muscles go from here and actually the muscle belly is here and then it goes
},
{
    97.68,101.24
     back to the tendon here and of course the tendons go through your carpal tunnel and
},
{
    101.24,106.68
     then the rest can provide the motion of your hand and wrist.
},
{
    106.68,110.88
     So what you're going to do is you can put one finger on top of another or you can just
},
{
    110.88,116.82
     put two next to each other but what you're looking for is you want to look for a boning
},
{
    116.82,117.82
     landmark.
},
{
    117.82,121.98
     This is right on the bone here and you might have to rub on the bone itself or a little
},
{
    121.98,123.64
     bit down further from it.
},
{
    123.64,126.16
     You're just going to find which spot
},
{
    126.16,132.12
     is really tender. And so here I got the bone right here so I'm rubbing, I'm going to rub a little
},
{
    132.12,139.16
     bit below it so I can put one finger on top of the other. Now I'm rubbing quite hard here. And my
},
{
    139.16,145.4
     guess is this is going to hurt. Now the thing is though it should get worse and worse and worse
},
{
    145.4,150.62
     eventually I'd like to see that it kind of plateaus out or even gets better or
},
{
    150.62,155.36
     numb over a period of a minute so if you're start rubbing on it it hurts the
},
{
    155.36,160.68
     first 10-15 seconds it starts getting worse worse worse yeah after 30 seconds
},
{
    160.68,169.92
     it's still getting worse stop and then I probably just put some ice on it ice it for a couple days and then try it again sure yeah the thing that is going
},
{
    169.92,174.28
     on here and why this is so helpful is quite often when you've heard the
},
{
    174.28,179.0
     tendons or the muscle you've laid down some scar tissue and that scar tissue
},
{
    179.0,187.56
     gets laid down in like a web and that web is not very strong so as soon as you start using the
},
{
    187.56,191.32
     arm again that web breaks open and so a lot of times it'll start getting better
},
{
    191.32,194.36
     you go oh it feels better I start doing something and all of a sudden it gets
},
{
    194.36,199.12
     worse again so you need to do the cross fiber friction massage over the muscle
},
{
    199.12,204.12
     and the tendons so that that web becomes more interlocked like this and
},
{
    204.12,205.0
     becomes stronger
},
{
    205.0,208.0
     and actually get more blood flowing through the area too.
},
{
    208.0,215.0
     So you're going to actually break up the scar tissue is what you're going to do so that it'll heal strong.
},
{
    215.0,221.0
     So now how long can you do this? You really can do it for 5 to 10 minutes to be honest with you.
},
{
    221.0,224.0
     Your fingers will wear out.
},
{
    224.0,228.72
     Your fingers will wear out before you can stop here and you
},
{
    228.72,234.16
     can do it every day or every other day depending on your tolerance. If the skin starts to break down
},
{
    234.16,239.28
     we'll be there you gotta get it. I've seen that happen you gotta give yourself a rest but this is
},
{
    239.28,244.32
     a real simple one to do Brad. I mean you can be at your desk I want your elbow straight you know a
},
{
    244.32,245.06
     pillow on here works really good and you can see at your desk, I want your elbow straight, a pillow on here
},
{
    245.06,250.12
     works really good, and you can see the dot here, so I'm rubbing right on that spot across
},
{
    250.12,256.8
     the fibers, very deep, breaking up the scar tissue, and for some people they can even
},
{
    256.8,258.3
     rub it down in here a little bit too.
},
{
    258.3,261.4
     Well that can help loosen up those muscles, if they happen to be tight because they're
},
{
    261.4,265.58
     protecting the injured area, a tight muscle is not going to be helpful at all
},
{
    265.58,271.24
     So get that loosened up. This is very common in people 40 to 60 years of age when I've seen it obviously younger
},
{
    271.24,275.98
     But you know how many sessions it's going to take it can vary a lot
},
{
    275.98,281.08
     I've seen people get better in a couple weeks and sometimes it can take six to 12 sessions even
},
{
    281.8,284.3
     But it often does get better if you know
},
{
    285.0,289.0
     12 sessions even, but it often doesn't get better if you have it. It's one of those things that you've had because these will last for months.
},
{
    289.0,294.0
     I mean I didn't do this but it wasn't bad and I could live but it just
},
{
    294.0,299.0
     continued to ache for quite a while. The reason it keeps lasting for months is because there's scar tissue
},
{
    299.0,304.0
     and the scar tissue keeps breaking open then it has to re-heal and then it breaks open again
},
{
    304.0,309.6
     and then it re-heal and it just keeps going in this cycle where you want to break up the cycle and break up the scar tissue.
},
{
    309.6,315.88
     So yeah if you want to get strong like bull and have strong papayas and be able to hit the
},
{
    315.88,321.0
     ball 300 yards you're gonna have to get that pain counter control so make sure you subscribe
},
{
    321.0,323.16
     if you haven't already. You too. Thanks.
