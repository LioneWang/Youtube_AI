},
{
    6.0,15.0
     Helping a person breathe by doing rescue breaths and chest compressions is important to keep the brain alive during an overdose.
},
{
    15.0,23.0
     These steps may also be taken if you have given naloxone to a person who is overdosed and are waiting for the medication to take effect.
},
{
    23.0,25.0
     These are the signs you should look for
},
{
    25.0,29.0
     before beginning rescue breathing and chest compressions.
},
{
    31.0,34.0
     The person is unconscious and not waking up.
},
{
    34.0,37.0
     They don't respond to shouting or rubbing knuckles on the breast bone
},
{
    37.0,40.0
     or between their upper lip and nose.
},
{
    40.0,42.0
     They are not breathing normally.
},
{
    42.0,48.28
     To begin rescue breathing, if the person is not breathing, follow these instructions.
},
{
    48.28,52.98
     Open the person's airway by placing one hand on the forehead and the other hand on the bony
},
{
    52.98,54.68
     part of their chin.
},
{
    54.68,60.2
     Gently tilt the head backward, slightly lift the chin.
},
{
    60.2,62.72
     Make sure their airway is clear.
},
{
    62.72,66.68
     Pinch the person's nose shut and cover their mouth with yours.
},
{
    66.68,69.28
     Take a regular, not a deep breath.
},
{
    70.24,73.12
     Give one rescue breath for one second.
},
{
    73.96,76.68
     Give a second rescue breath for one second.
},
{
    78.48,80.36
     You will know you have given enough air
},
{
    80.36,82.72
     when you see the person's chest begin to rise
},
{
    82.72,84.72
     with the breath you give.
},
{
    84.72,88.0
     As soon as you see chest movement, stop that breath.
},
{
    88.0,92.0
     Be careful not to give too much air.
},
{
    92.0,96.0
     If the person's chest doesn't rise on the first breath,
},
{
    96.0,100.0
     try repositioning the head or the airway and trying another breath.
},
{
    100.0,104.0
     To give chest compressions, follow these instructions.
},
{
    104.0,109.0
     Once you have given two rescue breaths, do 30 chest compressions.
},
{
    109.0,115.0
     Here's how. Place the heel of one hand on the center of the person's chest.
},
{
    115.0,117.0
     This is the lower half of the sternum.
},
{
    117.0,124.0
     Place the heel of the other hand on top of the first hand so that the hands are overlapped and parallel.
},
{
    124.0,126.96
     Push hard and fast, two inches
},
{
    126.96,133.04
     deep for anyone over the age of one. Allow the chest to fully return to normal position after each
},
{
    133.04,149.26
     compression. For every two rescue breaths, give 30 chest compressions. Within the space of a minute, you should give between 100 and 120 compressions.
},
{
    149.26,157.56
     For guidance, try to imagine giving compressions to a normal beat of row, row, row your boat.
},
{
    157.56,160.68
     Keep doing rescue breathing and chest compressions.
},
{
    160.68,164.6
     Stop if the person begins to breathe normally on their own.
},
{
    164.6,167.0
     They regain consciousness or wake up.
},
{
    167.0,170.0
     You are exhausted and can't continue.
},
{
    170.0,175.0
     EMS, police or other trained first responders arrive and take over care.
},
{
    175.0,181.0
     Although the risk is low, mouth-to-mouth rescue can transmit infectious diseases.
},
{
    181.0,184.0
     Consider your own safety before providing assistance.
},
{
    184.0,189.0
     Devices such as a pocket mask or face shield are designed to protect you while you deliver

{
    189.0,196.0
     rescue breathing and should be used according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
},
{
    196.0,201.0
     The Good Samaritan Law provides some legal protections to anyone who gives naloxone

{
    201.0,205.0
