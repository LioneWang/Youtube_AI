     You know at some point in time we're all going to incur injuries throughout life.

     Hi, I'm Captain Joe Bruni and what I'm going to discuss and go over is how to
},
{
    10.0,15.0
     splint a fractured hand. A fractured hand can be a pretty painful experience.
},
{
    15.0,24.0
     First evaluate the area to determine if there's discoloration or deformity to the hand region.
},
{
    24.0,27.0
     Some type of splinting material will be necessary.
},
{
    27.0,32.0
     Splinting material like this one found in a commercial first aid kit
},
{
    32.0,35.0
     is ideal for splinting the fractured hand.
},
{
    35.0,39.0
     If commercial splinting material is not available,
},
{
    39.0,43.0
     rolled up newspapers or other rigid material
},
{
    43.0,47.0
     may be used as a temporary splinting device.
},
{
    47.0,55.0
     The goal is to try and form the splinting material that will not only fit the arm,
},
{
    55.0,65.4
     but form an upward region that the person can grasp with the hand as the splinting material is applied.
},
{
    65.4,71.84
     Once applied, some type of pressure, bandage, or gauze
},
{
    71.84,75.72
     can be used to wrap around the region
},
{
    75.72,79.08
     and keep the rigidity of the splint in place.
},
{
    81.92,84.42
     Once the rigidity of the splint and the application
},
{
    84.42,87.0
     of a pressure bandage or gauze is in place,
},
{
    87.3,93.82
     some type of cold compress or ice can be used to help reduce swelling and pain. Do not apply
},
{
    93.82,100.72
     the ice or cold compress to the bare skin as this may cause a cold injury. Some type
},
{
    100.72,105.72
     of cloth between the cold application of ice or the compress
},
{
    110.08,110.6
     can be laid on top of some type of cloth material
},
{
    113.48,114.12
     insulating the skin from direct contact of the cold.
},
{
    118.44,119.48
     Cold will constrict the vascular system and
},
{
    123.76,125.7
     reduce blood flow, reducing swelling and pain to the region.
},
{
    125.7,130.98
     Any type of fracture can be a pretty painful event, but with proper first aid measures
},
{
    130.98,136.02
     and the proper steps taken, pain and swelling can be reduced, helping to speed the healing
},
{
    136.02,137.02
     process.
},
{
    137.02,139.58
     I'm Captain Joe Bruni, stay safe and we'll see you next time.
