     When dealing with an open fracture, please refer to your local protocols.
},
{
    4.0,9.0
     In this case, we're going to be looking at a lower leg fracture that's open.
},
{
    11.0,14.0
     Your first consideration is to control the bleeding.
},
{
    14.0,19.0
     I have 5x9 dressing that I'll place over the fracture site,
},
{
    19.0,22.0
     and I'll apply direct pressure.
},
{
    23.0,28.18
     Once the bleeding has been controlled,
},
{
    28.18,32.5
     you can wrap a cling right around the site.
},
{
    32.5,35.38
     You don't want to wrap this too tight so that you cut off circulation.
},
{
    43.74,47.92
     If the bleeding has not been controlled at this point, don't take the dressing off.
},
{
    47.92,61.76
     Just reapply another dressing and more pressure and keep adding onto it.
},
{
    61.76,63.68
     Once this is done, you're going to want to apply the splint.
},
{
    63.68,66.08
     This is going to help control bleeding a little bit more.
},
{
    69.08,71.24
     And also make it more comfortable for the patient.
},
{
    71.96,75.48
     When using a splint, use a rigid splint with a soft side.
},
{
    75.48,79.52
     You're going to put the soft side against the patient.
},
{
    79.52,82.9
     And you're going to want to find an appropriate size splint
},
{
    83.62,85.4
     that uses the joint above the
},
{
    85.4,91.12
     break and also the joint below the break.
},
{
    91.12,94.64
     If available, use one splint on either side.
},
{
    94.64,99.0
     There's many ways you can place a splint on the patient.
},
{
    99.0,101.48
     I'm going to use triangular bandages.
},
{
    101.48,108.86
     You can use tape. When using triangular bandages, make sure that the
},
{
    108.86,113.68
     knot goes actually on the splint itself and not against the patient's skin.
},
{
    113.68,119.68
     You're simply going to use an overhand knot and I like to double it up because
},
{
    119.68,128.48
     it keeps it from moving once it's been tightened. And then I like to use a square knot.
},
{
    132.44,139.66
     Make sure you place the first one above the joint, the next one above the break
},
{
    139.66,182.0
     itself. and one below the brake.
},
{
    182.0,186.56
     It's also imperative that before and after you splint a break that you check for pulse
},
{
    186.56,188.28
     motor and sensory.
},
{
    188.28,191.48
     That can be done by checking the pulse here.
},
{
    191.48,193.16
     Can you feel me touching you?
},
{
    193.16,194.68
     And can you please move your toes?
},
