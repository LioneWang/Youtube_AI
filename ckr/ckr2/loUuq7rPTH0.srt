     Hey everybody, it's Doctor Jo and today I'm going to show you some stretches and exercises for peripheral neuropathy. Let's get started.
},
{
    13.8,20.32
     So basically peripheral neuropathy is when your hands and your feet start feeling numb,
},
{
    20.72,21.9
     tingly,
},
{
    21.9,25.84
     almost feels like they're falling asleep. And the reason for that is because those
},
{
    25.84,31.28
     nerves, those peripheral nerves kind of start dying a little bit and then you don't get that
},
{
    31.28,37.12
     sensation down your feet, sometimes to your hands. It's more common in your feet, things like
},
{
    37.12,43.68
     diabetes caused this and just other things in general, bad circulation. So a good way to get that
},
{
    44.48,47.04
     circulation in there and get that feeling back
},
{
    47.04,52.24
     is to exercise and stretch the areas. We're going to focus on the feet today just because that's the
},
{
    52.24,57.28
     most common one. So getting them stretched out is really good. Let's start off with a calf stretch.
},
{
    57.28,61.04
     There's a bunch of different ways you can stretch your calves, but I'm just going to show you with
},
{
    61.04,70.04
     a strap. So you can use a stretch strap if you have one. If you don't, you can use a dog leash or you can just use a big beach towel, even a
},
{
    70.04,74.2
     belt. But you want it to be something solid, not one of those resistive bands. So
},
{
    74.2,79.48
     just wrap it kind of around the ball of your foot. You want to relax your foot so
},
{
    79.48,84.36
     you're not actively moving it. You're using the strap or the belt to actually
},
{
    84.36,85.16
     pull your foot.
},
{
    85.16,91.04
     So just relax it and then give it a nice pull until you feel a stretch in your calf areas.
},
{
    91.04,94.56
     You want your knee to be straight, so some people might bend it a little bit, but that's
},
{
    94.56,96.36
     not getting that stretch in your calf.
},
{
    96.36,101.24
     So keep the leg nice and straight, feel that stretch there, and hold that stretch for about
},
{
    101.24,102.94
     30 seconds.
},
{
    102.94,106.56
     Take a little break in between and then do three of those.
},
{
    106.56,108.96
     So just really getting that stretch,
},
{
    108.96,112.28
     getting that flexibility in the feet is really important
},
{
    112.28,114.96
     because a lot of times when you have that neuropathy
},
{
    114.96,119.32
     in your feet, you tend to not feel where your feet are
},
{
    119.32,121.72
     and sometimes you stumble, trip and fall
},
{
    121.72,123.68
     and so having good flexibility and strength
},
{
    123.68,127.0
     helps that out as well.
},
{
    127.0,134.4
     The next set of exercises, you want to have your heel free moving so if you've got a foam
},
{
    134.4,138.54
     roll or if you want to sit on the edge of something and let your foot hang off, you
},
{
    138.54,142.96
     want to be able to move that heel so if you're flat on the floor or something you won't have
},
{
    142.96,144.52
     quite as much movement.
},
{
    144.52,147.4
     But this time what you're going to do is just an ankle pump.
},
{
    147.4,151.44
     So pulling your foot up and then pushing it down.
},
{
    151.44,155.12
     So really just getting some good movement in the ankle.
},
{
    155.12,157.04
     So you don't have to go fast.
},
{
    157.04,161.8
     Make sure you get a good push at the end, good pull at the top, and just start off with
},
{
    161.8,162.8
     about 10 of those.
},
{
    162.8,165.12
     So you don't have to do a whole lot.
},
{
    166.14,169.44
     Then the next thing is gonna be ankle circles.
},
{
    169.44,173.24
     So now you're just making a circle at your ankle.
},
{
    173.24,174.44
     It's not your whole leg.
},
{
    174.44,176.64
     Sometimes people wanna kinda move the whole leg.
},
{
    176.64,179.48
     Try and keep the leg staying still
},
{
    179.48,182.36
     and get most of that movement at the ankle.
},
{
    182.36,186.06
     So do about 10 one way and then reverse it
},
{
    186.06,193.66
     and do it the other way. So just do ten of about each of those. So the next set of
},
{
    193.66,197.34
     exercises are going to be lying down.
},
{
    199.62,204.7
     You're just going to do a straight leg raise. So you want to keep the leg nice
},
{
    204.7,206.4
     and straight and locked out.
},
{
    206.4,211.2
     To keep it straight, if you pull up your toes, that helps keep it locked out and keep that
},
{
    211.2,212.88
     knee straight as well.
},
{
    212.88,217.0
     With a straight leg raise, you just want to lift it to about the height of the other side.
},
{
    217.0,219.4
     So you don't have to kick it super high.
},
{
    219.4,224.76
     You just have to get about that much motion in there and then slowly come back down.
},
{
    224.76,225.08
     You're really trying to control this movement. So you're not, you know, using momentum just and then slowly come back down. You're really
},
{
    225.08,228.92
     trying to control this movement so you're not you know using momentum just to
},
{
    228.92,233.2
     kick it up and down. You really want to control that, work those muscles, get
},
{
    233.2,237.28
     everything nice and strong in there. So just start off with about 10 then you
},
{
    237.28,242.08
     can do a couple sets of 10 and then work your way up from there. So you do both
},
{
    242.08,247.12
     sides and then you're gonna to do what we call hip
},
{
    247.12,253.52
     abduction or kicking your leg out to the side. The leg on the bottom can be kind of bent,
},
{
    253.52,258.8
     but you want your whole body to be in a straight line. A lot of times people, if they kick
},
{
    258.8,265.32
     up, they'll kick kind of forward, but that's not really working those hip abductor muscles. So pull your
},
{
    265.32,271.12
     toes tight again and almost lead with your heel slightly back behind you so
},
{
    271.12,275.6
     you're kicking back that way. So a lot of people want to do that but again that's
},
{
    275.6,279.8
     not getting those abductor muscles. So make sure you're leading with that heel
},
{
    279.8,285.52
     and going back just a little bit. So again just start off with about 10 and then
},
{
    285.52,289.72
     you can work your sets up to two or three and then just kind of work your way up
},
{
    289.72,294.12
     with your reps from there. Alright the next exercises are going to be standing
},
{
    294.12,299.12
     up. The next exercise is going to be a heel-toe raise and again this is just to
},
{
    299.12,302.52
     kind of strengthen those ankle muscles and get that that increased
},
{
    302.52,306.04
     circulation. So hold on to something sturdy, a sturdy chair,
},
{
    306.04,308.72
     or a countertop if you have it for some extra balance.
},
{
    308.72,309.96
     Cause again, a lot of times when you don't have
},
{
    309.96,311.92
     that feeling down there, your balance is off
},
{
    311.92,312.88
     just a little bit.
},
{
    312.88,316.0
     So go up nice and slow and come down
},
{
    316.0,317.46
     with a controlled motion.
},
{
    317.46,319.84
     So it's not just going up and down,
},
{
    319.84,322.24
     but really controlling that movement,
},
{
    322.24,323.76
     making those muscles work,
},
{
    323.76,328.44
     and then pull your toes up when you come back down. So you're just going to go all the way up with
},
{
    328.44,335.04
     the heels, slowly come down, and then pull the toes up. So just start off again
},
{
    335.04,340.12
     with about 10 of these, and then you can work your way up to 15 to 20. If those
},
{
    340.12,346.96
     become easy, then you can go just to one foot and still coming up nice and
},
{
    346.96,354.96
     slow down and then pull your toes up. So just going back and forth. And then the
},
{
    354.96,359.28
     last exercise is for balance because again that's one of those things that
},
{
    359.28,362.44
     you lose when you don't have that feeling down there or you always have that
},
{
    362.44,369.48
     tingling pins and needles feeling or some numbness in there. So just a simple stand on one foot,
},
{
    369.48,373.92
     again have something nice and sturdy. You might have to start off with two hands,
},
{
    373.92,379.52
     that's okay. Try and get to at least 10 seconds, work your way up to 30 seconds
},
{
    379.52,386.12
     or even a minute. If that becomes easy then you can go to one hand and then you can even
},
{
    386.12,391.2
     go to no hands. If all of that becomes easy and you're switching back and
},
{
    391.2,394.6
     forth a couple times and there's no problems with that then if you really
},
{
    394.6,399.4
     want to challenge yourself you can try closing your eyes. And again you can see
},
{
    399.4,404.2
     down at my ankle with my eyes closed it's moving a lot and that's pretty
},
{
    404.2,408.16
     normal that's just those muscles trying to find the balance,
},
{
    408.16,409.68
     especially when you don't have that feeling
},
{
    409.68,411.4
     to help you find that balance.
},
{
    411.4,412.32
     So there you have it.
