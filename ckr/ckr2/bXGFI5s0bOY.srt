    12.04,13.84
     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.
},
{
    13.84,14.96
     Brad Heineck, physical therapist.
},
{
    14.96,16.36
     Together we're the most famous physical therapists
},
{
    16.36,17.2

},
{
    17.2,18.28
     In our opinion, of course, Bob.
},
{
    18.28,20.76
     Today we're gonna talk about how to heal trigger finger
},
{
    20.76,23.24
     with four exercises that work.
},
{
    23.24,25.76
     We should really put at the end of that real patient, Brad.
},
{
    25.76,26.6
     Real patient.
},
{
    26.6,27.96
     Because we have a real patient, right?
},
{
    27.96,30.24
     Well, some people would consider me real.
},
{
    30.24,31.28
     Okay.
},
{
    31.28,32.36
     Not everyone.
},
{
    32.36,35.24
     One way or another, these exercises are real nice
},
{
    35.24,36.92
     and I'm excited to talk about this.
},

     Yeah, my wife said we should smile more.
},
{
    75.72,76.76
     Yeah, that's right.
},
{
    76.76,78.72
     Anyways, trigger finger,
},
{
    78.72,80.96
     I think most, not everyone knows what it is,
},
{
    80.96,82.84
     but if you have it, you probably do.
},
{
    82.84,85.96
     It's when, it's usually one of the fingers,
},
{
    85.96,88.44
     the thumb doesn't get it too often.
},
{
    88.44,90.64
     It's when you bend your finger down
},
{
    90.64,93.36
     and you feel a click and it gets stuck down there.
},
{
    93.36,94.88
     And then to get it on it,
},
{
    94.88,97.12
     it's usually pain is associated with it
},
{
    97.12,99.72
     and it clicks open and then it's there.
},
{
    99.72,102.12
     It's typically worse in the morning, getting out of bed.
},
{
    102.12,103.08
     It's more painful.
},
{
    103.08,105.48
     I've experienced this over the last month or so.
},
{
    105.48,107.16
     You're saying you have trigger finger, Brad.
},
{
    107.16,108.88
     Right, it's getting much better now.
},
{
    108.88,111.32
     As a matter of fact, I was hoping I could-
},
{
    111.32,112.16
     Make a click?
},
{
    112.16,113.48
     Yeah.
},
{
    113.48,115.16
     But you're curing it.
},
{
    115.16,118.08
     Thursday, it was doing this and I just hit it really hard
},
{
    118.08,120.12
     because I wanted to make sure what I said worked
},
{
    120.12,120.92
     and it's working.
},
{
    120.92,122.92
     I mean, it's almost gone.
},
{
    122.92,124.12
     Anyways, you know what?
},
{
    124.12,126.32
     If you have that trigger finger,
},
{
    126.32,128.52
     causes of trigger finger,
},
{
    128.52,130.7
     they really don't understand it fully,
},
{
    130.7,131.8
     but it's typically,
},
{
    131.8,134.32
     it happens a lot with people with rheumatoid arthritis.
},
{
    134.32,135.16
     Definitely I've seen with rheumatoid arthritis.
},
{
    135.16,137.16
     Just osteoarthritis.
},
{
    137.16,138.88
     People have a lot of repetitive motion
},
{
    138.88,141.8
     with their daily job or at home.
},
{
    141.8,142.64
     But again.
},
{
    142.64,144.2
     You're like trimming the bushes, you know,
},
{
    144.2,145.96
     or something. Sure, right.
},
{
    145.96,146.8
     Yep.
},
{
    146.8,148.0
     And it's not an electric one,
},
{
    148.0,149.4
     you're doing the squeeze on it.
},
{
    149.4,151.64
     Right, or if you do a lot of gripping at work,
},
{
    151.64,153.96
     the job I used to work before, I had a lot of that.
},
{
    153.96,155.0
     Sure.
},
{
    155.0,157.28
     Which may indicate why you have it now.
},
{
    157.28,158.64
     Well, that was 20 years ago.
},
{
    158.64,159.64
     Yeah, you know.
},
{
    160.64,161.72
     Delayed onset.
},
{
    161.72,162.56
     Right.
},
{
    162.56,164.32
     Anyways, we'll go on to that.
},
{
    164.32,167.28
     They talk about the reason it happens is
},
{
    167.28,171.12
     the muscle is down in here, your flexor muscles,
},
{
    171.12,172.76
     that flex your fingers are here
},
{
    172.76,175.32
     and the tendon's run up to your carpal tunnel
},
{
    175.32,176.56
     and into each finger.
},
{
    176.56,178.04
     And if you do this with your thumb
},
{
    178.04,180.76
     and you just relax your hand and you push on there,
},
{
    180.76,183.16
     your fingers will flex because you're tightening
},
{
    183.16,190.16
     those tendons and the tendons go through each finger has what they call a pulley and that tendon goes
},
{
    190.16,193.74
     through that pulley and that's where it gets hung up on which is at the base of
},
{
    193.74,197.22
     the finger. So I got a little demonstration here that would be fun to show people.
},
{
    197.22,200.72
     I think it's worthwhile showing this because it's gonna help you when you
},
{
    200.72,204.56
     treat it. Right. You know understanding why you're doing what you're doing. So
},
{
    204.56,206.96
     when we do this on a normal hand,
},
{
    206.96,209.96
     the tendon is going through the pulley like this.
},
{
    209.96,213.04
     Nice and smooth, no problems.
},
{
    213.04,215.6
     Now, when you get some scar tissue,
},
{
    215.6,219.2
     or whatever it is that makes that tendon not go through,
},
{
    219.2,221.0
     it's like this knot right here.
},
{
    221.0,223.1
     And it gets hung up in there,
},
{
    223.1,224.36
     and you get it to go through,
},
{
    224.36,225.52
     and then when you try to open it, it gets hung up in there and you get it to go through and then we try to
},
{
    225.52,230.72
     open it, it gets hung up typically a little more and you pull it and it pops through and
},
{
    230.72,236.2
     then it's smooth here but when you get to that one point every time that knot or that scar
},
{
    236.2,241.12
     tissue gets to that point, it hangs up. So what we want to do is eliminate that scar tissue.
},
{
    241.12,245.06
     Yeah, we want to break that scar tissue up so you have a smooth sailing all the way through.
},
{
    245.06,247.56
     There you go, and that's what we're gonna show you.
},
{
    248.86,250.38
     All right, Bob, should we show them?
},
{
    250.38,251.22
     Let's show them.
},
{
    251.22,252.06
     Okay, four steps.
},
{
    252.06,254.94
     First one is just working that hand
},
{
    254.94,257.26
     and getting it moving throughout the day
},
{
    257.26,258.14
     is gonna be helpful.
},
{
    258.14,259.22
     Typically in the morning,
},
{
    259.22,262.1
     it's gonna be more painful, do what you can.
},
{
    262.1,264.82
     If you can pop through that painful spot
},
{
    264.82,266.2
     and it'll put up and pop through it,
},
{
    266.2,268.18
     you can do that if it's too painful.
},
{
    268.18,271.04
     Just do range of motion in the pain-free range.
},
{
    271.04,272.2
     Yeah, don't get it fired up.
},
{
    272.2,273.04
     Right.
},
{
    273.04,275.32
     I mean, but you wanna mention, Brad,
},
{
    275.32,278.76
     that sometimes you'll find the tender spot down here
},
{
    278.76,280.24
     and you can actually hold onto that
},
{
    280.24,281.08
     while you're doing range.
},
{
    281.08,282.72
     I was gonna tell him that later.
},
{
    282.72,284.08
     Oh, okay, sorry, I jumped in.
},
{
    284.08,285.4
     We're gonna get back to that.
},
{
    285.4,287.56
     So active range of motion first and do that,
},
{
    287.56,291.34
     you know, 10, 20 repetitions in the pain-free range.
},
{
    291.34,295.4
     And then also range the finger out to the end range.
},
{
    295.4,298.88
     Okay, so mine was my middle finger or the third digit.
},
{
    298.88,302.42
     So when you open it up, push just that finger,
},
{
    302.42,303.72
     that's the end range.
},
{
    303.72,307.84
     Stretch it that way, five to 10 repetitions.
},
{
    307.84,309.04
     And then go the other way.
},
{
    309.04,311.64
     You're gonna have to go through the trigger part
},
{
    311.64,313.4
     and then push it down.
},
{
    313.4,315.8
     This way is a more painful side.
},
{
    315.8,318.4
     If it's really flared up, a week ago I wouldn't be able
},
{
    318.4,320.8
     to do this without saying bad words.
},
{
    320.8,322.92
     I can do it now and it's comfortable.
},
{
    322.92,324.88
     But I have been doing this as well.
},
{
    324.88,326.98
     And you can do that two to three times per day.
},
{
    326.98,329.22
     You're not gonna wanna do that all the time.
},
{
    329.22,331.2
     Because it's just too aggressive.
},
{
    331.2,333.76
     Now I think this is the real.
},
{
    333.76,335.48
     This is the one that's gonna make the big difference.
},
{
    335.48,336.32
     Right.
},
{
    336.32,338.0
     And this is, I'll show you what I've done
},
{
    338.0,340.32
     and then you can show that bonus one.
},
{
    340.32,343.14
     Is you're gonna find where that pulley is
},
{
    343.14,344.74
     and it's gonna be the tender spot
},
{
    344.74,346.56
     right at the base of the finger.
},
{
    346.56,348.68
     So is that the base of the finger?
},
{
    348.68,349.64
     Yeah, I'm doing it this way
},
{
    349.64,351.6
     because it's actually the finger that I've worked on.
},
{
    351.6,353.8
     And what I did is I used my thumb here
},
{
    353.8,356.76
     and I take my hand and hold on the back
},
{
    356.76,358.8
     and then I would use this thumb and then I would,
},
{
    358.8,360.28
     I actually, instead of,
},
{
    360.28,362.52
     we talked about cross friction going across,
},
{
    362.52,363.56
     I did all directions.
},
{
    363.56,365.48
     Yeah, and that's what I would recommend too.
},
{
    365.48,367.56
     Go absolutely in all directions.
},
{
    367.56,368.76
     This is really incredible
},
{
    368.76,370.96
     because I'm pushing pretty hard with all much pain.
},
{
    370.96,373.76
     And just three or four days ago when I started this,
},
{
    373.76,375.16
     this was not comfortable.
},
{
    375.16,377.56
     Yeah, you wanna find the tender spot basically.
},
{
    377.56,382.44
     And you start off, initially, you have to do it lightly.
},
{
    382.44,384.4
     And then over time, you can work into
},
{
    384.4,385.38
     being more aggressive.
},
{
    385.38,386.66
     Right.
},
{
    386.66,389.34
     If your trigger finger is really flared up the beginning
},
{
    389.34,392.18
     with and this really hurts, just don't do it.
},
{
    392.18,395.42
     You may want to put a cold pack on it,
},
{
    395.42,397.96
     maybe do some ibuprofen if that works for you.
},
{
    398.84,402.18
     But as this improves, I am just happy or happy
},
{
    402.18,405.1
     that I can work this and it's wonderful, Bob.
},
{
    405.1,407.08
     Yeah, so what I was mentioning before is
},
{
    407.08,410.08
     that you can actually find that tender spot sometimes
},
{
    410.08,413.72
     and then do range and it just seems like it helps
},
{
    413.72,416.78
     guide that pulley through the system there.
},
{
    416.78,419.32
     So if you do this and it triggers and it clicks,
},
{
    419.32,423.0
     if you push on it and then as a result of that pressure,
},
{
    423.0,424.84
     you can go through the range of motion.
},
{
    424.84,426.84
     See if you can, see if it makes it better.
},
{
    426.84,428.72
     If it doesn't, it's not worthwhile doing.
},
{
    428.72,429.66
     But if it does.
},
{
    429.66,431.16
     It does, that's the way to do it.
},
{
    431.16,432.96
     Yep, work that as well.
},
{
    432.96,434.76
     Remember, get that knot out of there
},
{
    434.76,436.0
     and get it smooth again.
},
{
    436.86,437.96
     Oh, the next thing,
},
{
    437.96,439.68
     and this is probably not as important,
},
{
    439.68,440.68
     but it is nice.
},
{
    440.68,442.68
     You want to do with the green one?
},
{
    442.68,443.8
     You got a rubber band.
},
{
    443.8,446.0
     You could just pull out a rubber band out of your
},
{
    446.0,447.44
     junk drawer at home if you have one
},
{
    447.44,449.16
     and you simply open up
},
{
    449.16,452.24
     and that's going to strengthen the opposite muscle group
},
{
    452.24,455.36
     which can get weak because you're not using that finger
},
{
    456.52,458.28
     and helps range out the hand
},
{
    458.28,461.48
     and do 10 to 15 of these once or twice a day.
},
{
    461.48,464.84
     So Brad, aren't you going to mention the apple cider
},
{
    464.84,465.68
     or not?
},
{
    465.68,468.2
     Well, I wasn't going to on this one, but we could.
},
{
    468.2,470.96
     I think it had, you know, it seems like it had
},
{
    470.96,474.24
     an anti-inflammatory effect on your finger.
},
{
    474.24,475.52
     There's a little longer story to this.
},
{
    475.52,477.84
     My both hands were very tight in the morning,
},
{
    477.84,479.48
     painful, arthritic tight.
},
{
    479.48,480.88
     Ow, especially this hand,
},
{
    480.88,483.68
     and this finger was by far the worst.
},
{
    483.68,484.88
     In about three and a half weeks,
},
{
    484.88,488.2
     so I started drinking two tablespoons of apple cider,
},
{
    488.2,489.76
     because we did some research on it.
},
{
    489.76,490.88
     Apple cider vinegar.
},
{
    490.88,492.16
     There we go, with the mother.
},
{
    492.16,493.16
     With the mother, right.
},
{
    493.16,494.84
     We've got a video on it.
},
{
    494.84,498.72
     Every day, I drink it, mix it with water, drink it.
},
{
    498.72,502.2
     And now I get up, my hands aren't tight anymore.
},
{
    502.2,504.64
     And how long had your fingers been that way?
},
{
    504.64,505.46
     Two years. Two years.
},
{
    505.46,506.3
     Two years.
},
{
    506.3,508.74
     And so this is the only thing you changed
},
{
    508.74,511.06
     is you started drinking apple cider vinegar
},
{
    511.06,512.26
     and all of a sudden it went away.
},
{
    512.26,513.18
     Right.
},
{
    513.18,515.74
     And it's actually, I'd say 90%
},
{
    515.74,517.02
     90% better.
},
{
    517.02,520.38
     It's not 100, but this finger was by far the worst,
},
{
    520.38,521.6
     the trigger finger one.
},
{
    521.6,524.86
     And now that one was 50% a week ago.
},
{
    524.86,526.88
     Since I've been doing this, I would say that's what-
},
{
    526.88,528.12
     It's gonna be brand new.
},
{
    528.12,529.82
     Yeah, which is really important to me
},
{
    529.82,532.16
     because I really enjoy my off time.
},
{
    532.16,535.32
     I really like to do things that I work with my hands.
},
{
    535.32,537.92
     Exactly, it really limits you in life.
},
{
    537.92,539.84
     Yeah, it was gonna change my whole life.
},
{
    539.84,541.4
     I was getting kind of depressed about it.
},
{
    541.4,543.0
     Now I'm starting to feel pretty good about it.
},
{
    543.0,543.92
     Life is good.
},
{
    543.92,546.8
     Apple cider vinegar, I wouldn't take it if you have reflux.
},
{
    546.8,547.64
     Oh yeah.
},
{
    547.64,549.68
     That's gonna make things worse, let me tell you.
},
{
    549.68,552.16
     If you've got any medications you're taking,
},
{
    552.16,554.08
     any things like that, you better check it with your doctor.
},
{
    554.08,554.92
     Yes, for sure.
},
{
    554.92,556.6
     So, by the way, if you're,
},
{
    556.6,557.68
     oh yes.
},
{
    557.68,558.84
     We can fix just about anything.
},
{
    558.84,560.28
     Except for a broken heart.
},
{
    560.28,561.24
     There you go.
},
{
    561.24,562.18
     But we'll work on it.
},
{
    562.18,563.02
     Yep, overtime.
},
{
    563.02,565.32
     We're gonna put overtime this week on it.
},
{
    565.32,566.16
     I'm not gonna.
},
{
    566.16,567.0
     I am.
},
{
    567.0,567.84
     I'm taking a break.
},
{
    567.84,568.84
     All right, thanks for watching.
},
