     Hi, my name is Angela Hammett. I'm the Perinatal Education Coordinator at Woman's Hospital
},
{
    19.88,26.64
     and I'm going to teach you how to use a bulb syringe on your baby. Occasionally your baby may have some,
},
{
    26.64,30.02
     may spit up and need to have their mouth suction.
},
{
    30.02,31.4
     Sometimes babies will also,
},
{
    31.4,32.84
     when they get their first little cold,
},
{
    32.84,35.12
     need to have their nose suctioned as well
},
{
    35.12,37.6
     to help them be able to breathe better.
},
{
    37.6,40.16
     This is the bulb that we use at Woman's Hospital
},
{
    40.16,42.88
     and we encourage you to take this bulb home with you.
},
{
    42.88,44.62
     And if you care for it properly,
},
{
    44.62,47.08
     it can be used throughout your baby's first year or
},
{
    47.08,48.88
     two.
},
{
    48.88,54.48
     When you go to use the bulb syringe, I always teach my patients to make a peace sign and
},
{
    54.48,57.56
     then drop it in and then use their thumb.
},
{
    57.56,61.72
     That way you have complete control over the bulb syringe.
},
{
    61.72,65.32
     What you're going to want to do is squeeze out all of the air before you
},
{
    65.32,71.9
     approach your baby. If you need to suction out both the baby's mouth and nose, we recommend
},
{
    71.9,77.88
     that you do the mouth first. So what you'll do is you'll insert the bulb syringe into
},
{
    77.88,87.88
     the side of the baby's cheek and go ahead and suction. And then you'll have a towel nearby that you can get all the excess out.
},
{
    87.88,91.44
     And then we'll suction the baby's other side of the cheek
},
{
    91.44,92.88
     and get that out.
},
{
    92.88,95.44
     When it's time to suction your baby's nose,
},
{
    95.44,98.2
     you can occlude one nostril
},
{
    98.2,101.8
     while you put the bulb syringe in the other nostril.
},
{
    101.8,103.9
     You don't have to push it up very far at all,
},
{
    103.9,109.06
     just right inside the tip of the nostril. And then we'll get whatever's out and we'll
},
{
    109.06,116.58
     repeat on the other side. Once you have finished using your bulb syringe, it's
},
{
    116.58,120.58
     very important that you take care of it and that you clean it after every use.
},
{
    120.58,126.5
     We recommend that you clean it with warm soapy water. So what you'll do is you'll
},
{
    126.5,135.3
     suck up the warm soapy water and then push it out and repeat that a couple of times. When you go
},
{
    135.3,141.58
     to dry the bulb syringe, it's very important that you not store it face up because we want all of
},
{
    141.58,145.36
     the water to drip out. So I would recommend that you store it
},
{
    145.36,150.96
     on the edge of the sink face down. For more information or to watch any more of our videos,
