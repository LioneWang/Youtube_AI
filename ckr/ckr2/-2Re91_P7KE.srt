     Hey, I'm Clay Louder with Colonial Family Practice.

     It's summertime here in South Carolina and we are seeing a lot of summertime injuries.
},
{
    10.88,14.96
     One of the main ones that we see is a fish hook injury.
},
{
    14.96,20.72
     And I have an unusual way that I like to treat that and I wanted to show it to you today.
},
{
    20.72,23.36
     Now there are three ways to remove a fish hook.
},
{
    23.36,28.42
     One way is to go to the doctor, get some local anesthetic put into it, and get the hook
},
{
    28.42,29.86
     removed that way.
},
{
    29.86,34.14
     The second way is the pull through method where you take the hook and you actually push
},
{
    34.14,39.9
     it through, cut off the barb with something heavy, and then remove the fish hook.
},
{
    39.9,41.38
     Both those to me are boring.
},
{
    41.38,47.16
     The best way to take a fish hook out that I think is called the string jerk method.
},
{
    47.16,50.86
     I didn't learn this in medical school or in residency, but I learned it from my uncle
},
{
    50.86,53.56
     Steve Lauder who's a professional fisherman.
},
{
    53.56,57.0
     And so I'd like to show you today the way that I jerk hook out.
},
{
    57.0,61.12
     Now first thing you need to understand is fish hook physiology.
},
{
    61.12,64.96
     This is a Gamagatsu chemically sharpened fish hook.
},
{
    64.96,67.32
     And right here you can see the barb on the hook.
},
{
    67.32,71.12
     The barb is what catches the fish and holds him to your hook.
},
{
    71.12,76.84
     Well, unfortunately when that goes into human skin, the barb catches and won't come out.
},
{
    76.84,80.6
     And to get it out, you have to release that barb.
},
{
    80.6,86.0
     So the number one thing you need to remember about that is how to release the barb on this fish hook.
},
{
    86.0,92.0
     Now what I have here is Mr. Pig and he unfortunately stepped on a fish hook probably out in the boat shed
},
{
    92.0,99.0
     and he's got it hooked into him and we're going to try to jerk it out of him and we didn't give him any anesthetic at all
},
{
    99.0,106.18
     so he's going to try to tough it out. As you can see he's got a big worm hook in him and it stuck past the barb and stuck
},
{
    106.18,107.18
     pretty good.
},
{
    107.18,112.74
     Now, what I've done is I've taken some braided line and I've doubled it up and so I've made
},
{
    112.74,117.96
     it to a strong connection and I'm going to put that over the fish hook and I'm going
},
{
    117.96,118.96
     to jerk it out.
},
{
    118.96,122.34
     Now, I'm not going to pull it and I'm not going to ease it out.
},
{
    122.34,127.12
     And what I'm going to do, the most critical part is to use my left hand to put pressure on the hook
},
{
    127.12,130.84
     to release the barb so that I can jerk it out.
},
{
    130.84,133.84
     Kind of goes like this here.
},
{
    133.84,137.6
     So you take the line, wrap it around the hook.
},
{
    137.6,140.88
     Hopefully the patient hasn't cut the hook too much,
},
{
    140.88,142.6
     so you can get to it.
},
{
    142.6,147.44
     Then I push down firm with my left thumb. I usually like
},
{
    147.44,151.76
     to count the three and jerk on two. So the patient doesn't know I'm getting ready
},
{
    151.76,155.46
     to do it because they'll be tense. Sometimes you have to give them local
},
{
    155.46,159.44
     anesthesia like with a Kors light or something. If they do that it usually
},
{
    159.44,166.88
     calms them down. But the first thing I do is just count the three, one, two, boom.
},
{
    166.88,172.72
     Fish hook pops out, you have a happy patient and he is good to go for the next round of
},
{
    172.72,173.72
     fishing.
},
{
    173.72,177.48
     So that's been Clay Louder with my fish hook removal.
},
{
    177.48,179.04
     Hope you have a great summer.
