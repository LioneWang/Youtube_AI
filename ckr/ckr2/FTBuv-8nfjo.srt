     This video will show you how to use your incentive spirometer.
},
{
    9.8,14.84
     The first time you use your incentive spirometer, you'll need to expand the tubing and connect
},
{
    14.84,31.84
     it to the outlet on the right side of the base. Sit upright in a chair or in bed.
},
{
    31.84,35.36
     Hold the incentive spirometer at eye level.
},
{
    35.36,38.04
     Exhale slowly.
},
{
    38.04,42.92
     Put the mouthpiece in your mouth and seal your lips tightly around it.
},
{
    42.92,47.0
     Take a slow, deep breath in through your mouth. Remember, you
},
{
    47.0,55.24
     must breathe in through your mouth, not your nose.
},
{
    55.24,62.04
     As you inhale deeply, you will see the piston rise on the left side. While the piston rises,
},
{
    62.04,65.0
     the indicator on the right should move upwards.
},
{
    65.0,68.0
     It should stay in between the two arrows.
},
{
    68.0,71.0
     If the indicator doesn't stay between the two arrows,
},
{
    71.0,75.0
     it means you are breathing either too fast or too slow.
},
{
    77.0,82.0
     Try to get the piston as high as you can while keeping the indicator between the two arrows.
},
{
    82.0,85.72
     When you get the piston to reach as high as you can,
},
{
    85.72,89.98
     hold it for three to five seconds, then exhale normally.
},
{
    93.04,96.6
     Let the piston fall all the way back to the bottom.
},
{
    96.6,97.7
     Now rest.
},
{
    99.44,102.68
     You should do this 10 times an hour while you're awake.
},
{
    102.68,104.6
     Try to get the piston to the same level
},
{
    104.6,106.7
     each time you do the exercise.
},
{
    110.5,115.5
     After each time you use the incentive spirometer, give three deep coughs.
},
{
    118.0,122.5
     This will help clear the secretions from your lungs, even if you're not coughing anything up.
},
{
    122.0,127.0
     even if you're not coughing anything up.
},
{
    130.0,131.0
     If you're not able to finish your breaths, take a break.
},
{
    133.0,135.0
     Put the marker at the level you reached. This will be your goal next time.
},
{
    137.0,141.0
     Take 10 breaths per hour using your incentives parameter.
},
{
    141.0,145.0
     This will help prevent pneumonia and other complications after surgery.
},
{
    145.0,150.0
