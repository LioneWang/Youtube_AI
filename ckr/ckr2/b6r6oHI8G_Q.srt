    0.0,2.0
     So who's ever been laying in bed at night
},
{
    2.0,4.5
     and you've got a little bit of a stuffy nose
},
{
    4.5,5.92
     and you want a quick little trick?
},
{
    5.92,10.6
     Well, Dr. Ordon, as our resident ear, nose, and throat doctor,
},
{
    10.6,13.52
     I'm gonna let you give our little prescription today.
},
{
    13.52,15.84
     Okay, if you're stuffy, lying in bed,
},
{
    15.84,17.6
     this is what you need to do.
},
{
    17.6,22.6
     Take your thumb, gently press in between your brows like that,
},
{
    24.4,27.64
     then alternate with taking your tongue
},
{
    27.64,30.84
     and touching the roof of your mouth, your palate.
},
{
    33.8,35.24
     Go back to this.
},
{
    37.54,39.08
     Go back to that, now.
},
{
    40.72,42.04
     And then jump up in one leg.
},
{
    42.04,45.0
     That's for such abundance.
},
{
    47.0,50.0
     Now what this does, we have all these very intricate,
},
{
    50.0,53.0
     what we call cranial nerves that are in and around
},
{
    53.0,55.0
     the sinus as your nose, and what you're doing,
},
{
    55.0,57.0
     it's sort of like acupressure.
},
{
    57.0,60.0
     You're stimulating these cranial nerves in such a way
},
{
    60.0,64.0
     that it may have effect to open up your nasal passages.
},
{
    64.0,65.4
     Well, and you mentioned, you know,
},
{
    65.4,66.8
     acupuncture can be effective for people.
},
{
    66.8,67.84
     Well, it's sort of like acupressure.
},
{
    67.84,68.68
     It's a cool little, hey.
},
{
    68.68,72.04
     If you are stimulating certain nerves around the nose,
},
{
    72.04,72.88
     why not?
},
{
    74.16,75.88
     That was a really good demonstration.
},
{
    75.88,77.2
     Give it up for Dr. Orton, everyone.
},
{
    77.2,79.28
     It's your Mr. Ding on Today Show.
},
{
    79.28,80.8
