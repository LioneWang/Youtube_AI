     Hi, my name is Dr. David Kwan and I'm here to teach you about blood clots and what you
},
{
    24.64,29.08
     can do to prevent them from occurring here in the hospital.
},
{
    29.08,34.64
     Blood clots consist of deep vein thrombosis, DVT, clots found in the legs, and pulmonary
},
{
    34.64,39.12
     embolism, PE, clots found in the lungs.
},
{
    39.12,47.42
     For the sake of this video, we will refer to DVT as leg clots and PE as lung clots.
},
{
    47.42,51.38
     Blood clots found in the legs can form in shallow or deep veins.
},
{
    51.38,56.72
     The good news is leg clots are preventable and treatable if discovered early.
},
{
    56.72,61.12
     Blood clots in the lung are a clot that travels to the lung from another location, usually
},
{
    61.12,62.52
     the leg.
},
{
    62.52,65.84
     If the clot is small, with treatment, people can recover
},
{
    65.84,71.22
     from a lung clot. A clot in the lung is a serious life-threatening complication
},
{
    71.22,77.4
     that can be fatal. All patients in the hospital are at risk for developing
},
{
    77.4,81.28
     blood clots. However, they can be prevented when patients and the health
},
{
    81.28,87.3
     care team work together. Remember, prevention is the key.
},
{
    87.3,88.54
     Based on your risk factors,
},

    88.54,91.78
     your doctor will tell you what to do before and after surgery
},
{
    91.78,93.3
     to prevent blood clots.
},
{
    95.64,99.34
     Walking, it is important to walk while you're in the hospital
},
{
    99.34,100.58
     because when you walk,
},
{
    100.58,103.74
     your blood does not sit still long enough to clot.
},
{
    103.74,110.82
     So get up and walk in the hallway every two to three hours if you are able. If not, do the leg exercises provided
},
{
    110.82,115.72
     by the staff while you are sitting in a chair.
