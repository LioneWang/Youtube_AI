     Hey everybody, it's Doctor Jo. I've had several people ask me what kind of stretches and exercises
},
{
    18.84,25.04
     do they need to do for Osgoode-Schladder's disease. Yeah, Molly doesn't know what that is either.
},
{
    25.04,28.68
     But basically what it is, is the tendon,
},
{
    28.68,31.12
     that patellar tendon that connects the kneecap
},
{
    31.12,33.2
     to your leg is really tight.
},
{
    33.2,36.32
     And so it pulls on the bone right there,
},
{
    36.32,37.56
     which is your tibia bone.
},
{
    37.56,40.12
     And it makes a big bump and it causes a lot of pain
},
{
    40.12,41.48
     and irritation in the knee.
},
{
    41.48,44.68
     So let's get started on those stretches and exercises.
},
{
    44.68,47.92
     It's most important to stretch your quad muscle, because that's the one that's connected to the knee. So let's get started on those stretches and exercises. It's most important to stretch your quad muscle because that's the one that's
},
{
    47.92,51.28
     connected to the kneecap where the tightness is, but you also want to stretch
},
{
    51.28,55.6
     your hamstrings and your calf muscles. So let's get started. The first one's going
},
{
    55.6,59.6
     to be those that quad muscle that you want to stretch. So you can take a strap,
},
{
    59.6,67.04
     belt, leash, dog leash, maybe Baileys, and tie it around your leg. I can't use a dog
},
{
    67.04,71.84
     leash because they would get very excited if I pulled it out. Turn over onto your
},
{
    71.84,77.88
     stomach and take the strap and just pull towards you. Now if you're feeling a
},
{
    77.88,82.04
     little stretching you want a little bit more in that quad, lift your leg up just
},
{
    82.04,85.28
     a little bit. Hold that stretch for 30 seconds and
},
{
    85.28,94.2
     do that three times. Then you want to roll back over and stretch out your calf
},
{
    94.2,100.4
     muscles. You can put it just on the ball of your foot here, straighten out your leg,
},
{
    100.4,113.28
     relax your foot and pull it towards you. Same thing, you're going to hold it for 30 seconds and do that three times. And then the last one is the
},
{
    113.28,118.24
     hamstring stretch. So you can just keep the strap there, lie down and straighten
},
{
    118.24,126.32
     out your leg and pull it up towards you. And again, 30 seconds stretching it three times. Now I have
},
{
    126.32,129.84
     specific videos that show all of these stretches in a whole bunch of different
},
{
    129.84,133.64
     ways to stretch them so if you want to check those out you can go ask Dr. Joe
},
{
    133.64,141.08
     dot com. The next thing you want to do is strengthen it. So lying down you're
},
{
    141.08,150.58
     gonna do a straight leg raise. The important part of a straight leg raise is you want to pull your toes close to you so that locks out your leg. Keep the
},
{
    150.58,156.92
     leg as straight as possible and slowly lift it up just to even with the other
},
{
    156.92,160.76
     one. Now if you kick it all the way up like this that's actually easier it's
},
{
    160.76,165.78
     not as hard so control it going up and then slowly coming back
},
{
    165.78,170.38
