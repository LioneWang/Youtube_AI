     I'm Billy Joe with Medical Service Company. I'm a respiratory therapist. I'm here today
},
{
    12.08,17.1
     to show you how to use an oxygen concentrator machine. When you go on oxygen, this is the
},
{
    17.1,27.0
     machine that you'd be getting. You want to leave it on the floor and in the back the very first thing you want to do is plug it in.
},
{
    29.26,34.82
     Then on the sides there's these gray spongy filters. You just want to take them out, wash
},
{
    34.82,41.82
     them, run them through some water, squeeze them out, put them back in when they're dry.
},
{
    47.0,53.0
     There's one on each side of the machine. Then the next thing, on the front here you've got the dial.
},
{
    53.0,58.0
     This will set the amount of oxygen that you need based on what your doctor's prescribed for you.
},
{
    58.0,62.0
     Right above it is a little connector. That's where your tubing will go.
},
{
    62.0,66.0
     Over here you've got the on and off button.
},
{
    66.0,68.44
     When you turn the machine on it will alarm.
},
{
    71.56,74.88
     The alarm should last for a few seconds, then it will stop.
},
{
    75.74,79.76
     Over here you turn the dial to set your leader flow.
},
{
    79.76,81.98
     And you just wanna turn it to the number
},
{
    81.98,84.36
     that the doctor wants you to be on.
},
{
    84.36,87.18
     When you set it you wanna be kneeling down to look at it.
},
{
    87.18,90.62
     You don't want to be standing up.
},
{
    90.62,96.0
     If you turn the machine off and you turn it back on, it will stay at what you set it at.
},
{
    96.0,98.5
     So you don't have to worry about that.
},
{
    98.5,104.08
     Part of your setup, you'll get 50 feet of tubing so you can get around the house and
},
{
    104.08,106.0
     go wherever you need to go. You shouldn't have longer than 50 feet of tubing so you can get around the house and go wherever you need to go.
},
{
    106.0,109.0
     You shouldn't have longer than 50 feet.
},
{
    109.0,113.0
     On both ends of the tubing, you'll have connectors that look like this.
},
{
    113.0,115.0
     One end goes to the machine.
},
{
    115.0,118.0
     The other end is going to go to what you connected and put in your nose.
},
{
    118.0,121.0
     So this end is going to go right on here.
},
{
    121.0,129.44
     Just push it on there pretty good. And then you also get this. This is called a cannula.
},
{
    129.44,136.32
     Part of it on one end is green. The other end is going to go in your nose. So you take the green
},
{
    136.32,142.96
     end, you put it in the end of the 50-foot tubing. Just give it a little push, put it right in there.
},
{
    142.96,146.34
     And then this end is the cannula.
},
{
    146.34,149.64
     Two little prongs here, they go in your nose.
},
{
    149.64,151.74
     They should curve like this.
},
{
    151.74,156.58
     And they go right in, up and over your ears like this.
},
{
    156.58,158.58
     And then you can pull this little slider up
},
{
    158.58,161.38
     to make it more snug if you'd like.
},
{
    161.38,165.84
     And then you would be connected to your oxygen.
},
{
    165.84,167.48
     I hope this was helpful.
},
{
    167.48,172.28
