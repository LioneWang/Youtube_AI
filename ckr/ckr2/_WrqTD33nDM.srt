     Bob and Brad, the two most famous physical therapists on the internet.
},
{
    8.0,11.42
     Hi, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.
},
{
    11.42,12.42
     Brad Heineck, physical therapist.
},
{
    12.42,14.6
     Together we are the most famous physical therapists on the internet.
},
{
    14.6,16.0
     In our opinion, of course, Bob.
},
{
    16.0,19.0
     Brad, it's no secret out there, we're big McKenzie fans.
},
{
    19.0,20.0
     Right.
},
{
    20.0,24.76
     Robin McKenzie, he came up with some treatments for the spine, neck back, and he actually does
},
{
    24.76,25.8
     the extremities now too.
},
{
    25.8,27.0
     Exactly, arms and legs.
},
{
    27.0,33.0
     But when we have somebody with neck pain or with a pinched nerve, the pinched nerve causing pain down the arm,
},
{
    33.0,36.0
     this is probably our, it is our number one go-to approach.
},
{
    36.0,37.0
     Sure.
},
{
    37.0,38.0
     Would you agree?
},
{
    38.0,39.0
     Absolutely.
},
{
    39.0,46.16
     So today we're going to go over some of the basics of the McKenzie approach, but you know we recommend that if you get stuck and
},
{
    46.16,50.2
     you're not getting better that you may want to go ahead and seek out a McKenzie therapist
},
{
    50.2,53.32
     and I'll put that video on the end of this one on how to find one.
},
{
    53.32,54.88
     Right and they're worldwide.
},
{
    54.88,60.0
     Yeah, they're worldwide exactly what we decide 36, 38 countries something like that so definitely
},
{
    60.0,62.68
     a lot of them in the United States.
},
{
    62.68,69.44
     So basically what we're trying to do Brad is we're trying to, if you're dealing with a pinched nerve or neck pain, a lot of
},
{
    69.44,74.24
     times you're getting pain. Does that show up Lonnie? I know this looks like an alien.
},
{
    74.24,79.36
     You got really good artwork Bob. You're getting better. Now this is the
},
{
    79.36,83.8
     back of the person. That's why you don't see the face on there. Exactly. And this
},
{
    83.8,85.9
     is a common pain patterns.
},
{
    85.9,90.06
     You might have it going down into the shoulder, down into the back of the arm, down into
},
{
    90.06,91.86
     the arm itself, and even into the hand.
},
{
    91.86,93.94
     That includes numbness and tingling.
},
{
    93.94,96.1
     Yep, that's very common.
},
{
    96.1,98.18
     And you also might have it in the shoulder blade.
},
{
    98.18,99.18
     Exactly.
},
{
    99.18,101.98
     As a matter of fact, we just had a viewer ask about this, and this would be a good one
},
{
    101.98,102.98
     for you to watch.
},
{
    102.98,107.64
     So the big thing about this with the McKenzie exercise what you're trying to do is to get the
},
{
    107.64,112.06
     pain to what we call centralize. You want it to come out of the extremities
},
{
    112.06,117.12
     and go into more of the base of the neck. Right and you want to go from the distal
},
{
    117.12,120.8
     to the proximus. We're using some therapy words here. So the extremities of the
},
{
    120.8,129.32
     arm and we want to get it from the most farthest way. We'd be the fingertips if it went that far and have it come back just like a thermometer going backwards
},
{
    129.32,131.0
     you know that's I always tell my face.
},
{
    131.0,132.0
     Good analogy.
},
{
    132.0,136.44
     But what we really don't want to see is that it actually goes away here and gets worse
},
{
    136.44,137.44
     in the arm.
},
{
    137.44,138.44
     Right.
},
{
    138.44,139.44
     I mean and the fingers.
},
{
    139.44,140.44
     That's no good.
},
{
    140.44,141.44
     Yeah.
},
{
    141.44,143.92
     So the exercise what you're looking for when you do the exercise is that this may start
},
{
    143.92,145.84
     to go away in the first, you know
},
{
    146.0,149.0
     Here, let me help you Bob. And then eventually it goes out of the arm
},
{
    149.0,154.12
     I know I'm not doing this perfect here and then maybe it goes out of the shoulder blade and
},
{
    154.6,158.36
     Eventually it just you know, it's stuck right here and eventually then it'll go away
},
{
    158.36,164.76
     It could even get a little more intense in this area, couldn't you say? Right, but it's usually not that intense where you can't take it
},
{
    164.76,165.06
     It's just right more intense and you can't take it, it's just
},
{
    165.46,171.28
     more intense and we call it that's the center right there, the low part of the neck. Right, so
},
{
    171.64,173.64
     having done that. Right about where the collar is.
},
{
    173.64,179.3
     All right, these are the, well the first thing you need to do Brad is you have to make sure you correct your posture.
},
{
    179.3,184.26
     If you're working and you're like this all day long. Yeah, working on a computer.
},
{
    184.26,187.24
     I don't care how many times you do these exercises, it's not going to help because you're going
},
{
    187.24,189.08
     to go right back to that.
},
{
    189.08,192.48
     So you need to make sure you're getting your ears lined up with the shoulders, shoulders
},
{
    192.48,195.56
     lined up with the hips, you know, that type of thing.
},
{
    195.56,198.04
     And this first exercise helps you a little bit with that.
},
{
    198.04,201.24
     So the first exercise we're doing is neck retractions.
},
{
    201.24,202.8
     That's exercise number one.
},
{
    202.8,210.5
     So basically you're taking your chin. Your your chin tucks so you're going back we've showed this one many times
},
{
    210.5,214.84
     yep talk about like a pie in the face I thought you want to be do a high five
},
{
    214.84,219.22
     Bob no yeah so yeah it's hard yeah something's coming like that pie you
},
{
    219.22,223.64
     just whoo you back up you know an option for this if this doesn't work or it
},
{
    223.64,226.76
     makes a little problem you can oh, yeah, absolutely
},
{
    227.2,229.2
     You can do it laying down
},
{
    229.44,236.3
     As a matter of fact, I just gave this information to one of our viewers last night when I was responding and
},
{
    236.64,239.76
     He said it hurt when he is doing the chin tucks in this seated position
},
{
    239.76,242.64
     Well, make sure you try it in a position like this
},
{
    242.92,245.48
     So now the back of your head does come
},
{
    245.48,249.1
     to you. Sometimes Brad, I even use a little towel like this. Sure. It makes it easier than
},
{
    249.1,255.4
     the chin tuck. And that position, the change in position, the weight bearing changes the
},
{
    255.4,259.8
     mechanics slightly and you may have success. You're not so much chin down, you have chin
},
{
    259.8,267.0
     back. Yeah. I like it better like this, but you could certainly use something in it.
},
{
    267.0,270.36
     Even your hand if you don't have a toe roll.
},
{
    270.36,276.48
     So if you try the exercise sitting up and it's painful, maybe try laying down.
},
{
    276.48,279.0
     And that's going to be the same for exercise number two breath.
},
{
    279.0,281.44
     Which is an important point of Bob.
},
{
    281.44,286.28
     The first time or two it may help, but if by the third time
},
{
    286.28,290.56
     if you start to feel some changes, some of that things feeling better, then you're not
},
{
    290.56,294.84
     going to go over repetitions up to ten, so you need some repetitions in there, but usually
},
{
    294.84,295.84
     not more than ten.
},
{
    295.84,300.6
     And that's a good point Brad, because actually it may hurt a little more even at first, for
},
{
    300.6,305.0
     the first couple reps, but it should start getting back to normal, you know,
},
{
    305.0,309.0
     very rapidly, and then eventually it should start to feeling better. If you
},
{
    309.0,313.0
     get seven or eight and it's not improving and things are actually getting worse
},
{
    313.0,318.0
     in there, stop. You need to see a therapist then, I mean it's just no
},
{
    318.0,322.0
     way about it. All right, next one we're going to do is actually we're going to do
},
{
    322.0,326.6
     extensions, but again what's good about the chin tux is getting you a good posture.
},
{
    326.6,330.84
     The next one, I'd like you to find a chair with a nice solid back like this.
},
{
    330.84,334.32
     And a lot of times you do a couple chin tux to warm up a little bit.
},
{
    334.32,337.04
     And then you're going to go ahead and work on going back.
},
{
    337.04,340.6
     Now you can go back to the point where it starts to really hurt then back off.
},
{
    340.6,341.76
     Right.
},
{
    341.76,344.88
     You can work halfway, go back.
},
{
    344.88,346.8
     And then eventually you want to think with
},
{
    346.8,351.84
     the key with all these is to really get back as far as you can.
},
{
    351.84,355.96
     As long as making it better. Right. As long as it's making the symptoms down your arm
},
{
    355.96,360.44
     or in your back or in your neck better. Right. Centralization is occurring on it.
},
{
    360.44,369.52
     Right. You want to show the towel breath? Right. A lot of times I'll have people and my patients they'll start doing that the chin tuck is doing good and then they'll get back to
},
{
    369.52,376.48
     here and they can't really do it so I'll have them take a towel roll put it here and with that
},
{
    376.48,381.44
     little bit of support not pulling hard but just a little bit of support and then all of a sudden oh
},
{
    381.44,385.64
     yeah that feels better and then they can go back and then you can help pull your head up
},
{
    385.64,391.98
     To a little bit so in the initial phase is that towel roll can really be helpful. I do it a little different
},
{
    391.98,396.98
     I use the edge of the towel quite often. I'll use I was taught this way too and then I
},
{
    397.28,401.16
     Like the edge on the towel. There's a name for that edge, but I can't remember it
},
{
    401.3,406.02
     Yeah, I think there is and I like to bring it up actually towards the eyes
},
{
    406.02,408.26
     like this and then I bring the arms go along
},
{
    408.26,409.36
     with the neck like this.
},
{
    409.36,412.16
     Yeah, I learned that, then we learned that in Mulligan class.
},
{
    412.16,413.0
     Could be, yeah.
},
{
    413.0,414.76
     And then you can go different levels.
},
{
    414.76,416.4
     You can go a little bit lower,
},
{
    416.4,417.22
     Sure.
},
{
    417.22,418.9
     A little bit lower and see how it works with that.
},
{
    418.9,420.64
     Now again, Brad kind of alluded to this,
},
{
    420.64,421.96
     but with all these,
},
{
    421.96,424.22
     you're gonna do the exercise 10 times,
},
{
    424.22,428.16
     and you can do it five to six times a day. I actually tell my patients to do it every hour.
},
{
    428.16,431.4
     Sure. And the reason I tell them to do it every hour because I know they won't. I
},
{
    431.4,435.36
     mean nobody can do everything every hour just to get busy but they end up
},
{
    435.36,439.5
     doing it five to six times a day. So that's a good start. Same thing with this
},
{
    439.5,443.84
     one if this is just too tender not working you can do this off the edge of
},
{
    443.84,451.7
     the bench. You can go off the edge like this, and you can take your hand like this, and you can just lower yourself like that.
},
{
    451.7,455.3
     This is the one where I really do like to use the whole towel.
},
{
    455.3,456.3
     Oh yeah, that would work too.
},
{
    456.3,458.3
     It's a little more control.
},
{
    458.3,459.3
     More control.
},
{
    459.3,462.8
     Again, we can't emphasize this enough.
},
{
    462.8,466.08
     You're only going to do these if they improve and
},
{
    466.08,469.64
     they're improving the pain and they're going to prove it by the tenth one you
},
{
    469.64,474.76
     should feel clearly better than the first one. Right, certainly not worse. Right. I
},
{
    474.76,478.32
     mean maybe it'll stabilize, maybe it's going to take a little bit but you know
},
{
    478.32,481.84
     you'd like to see something improving in the hand or if it doesn't go all the way
},
{
    481.84,487.56
     to the hand it's just it's not going into the shoulder as much. Yeah if you can eliminate the symptoms of tingling and
},
{
    487.56,492.16
     stuff from here to here and this is gone that's good progress. 80% of the
},
{
    492.16,496.52
     people get better with this. That's that you know 80% of the people. Alright the
},
{
    496.52,500.64
     third exercise this is the one that helped me Brad. Let's say having pain on
},
{
    500.64,504.56
     the right side you're actually going to do first going to get into kind of a good
},
{
    504.56,507.72
     position good posture and you're actually going to do first going to get into kind of a good position, good posture, and you're actually going to side bend
},
{
    507.72,515.36
     towards the side. Towards the side of the pain. So chin tuck, towards the
},
{
    515.36,520.8
     side of the pain. And again we should say symptoms technically because sometimes
},
{
    520.8,525.72
     it's numbness and tingling, but so we want to include everything with this.
},
{
    525.72,529.12
     The numbness and tingling might get better. I had a dentist that did this one,
},
{
    529.12,534.12
     worked beautifully. I mean this didn't work, this didn't work, went to this and
},
{
    534.12,537.4
     it went right away and he had it all the way into those hands. Did you get some
},
{
    537.4,541.32
     free dental work? No I didn't, as you can tell. No, the old barter system didn't go.
},
{
    541.32,545.7
     So that one works out really good. Again with all these there's
},
{
    545.7,549.82
     a lot of different things that can be tried by a therapist that works with you
},
{
    549.82,553.84
     and that's been trained in this. Right. I mean it's actually a it's a four day
},
{
    553.84,557.58
     course just for the back or five day course for the back. There's a four for the low back,
},
{
    557.58,561.66
     three I think for the neck. We've took it it's been a few years. Yeah so I mean
},
{
    561.66,567.64
     there's a lot of different things that can be tried so if you're not having a luck I would seek a McKenzie therapist out.
},
{
    567.64,572.16
     Exactly. Again you won't be disappointed this is your best chance of getting things
},
{
    572.16,576.8
     resolved without surgery. Right. Without you know being heavily medicated all the
},
{
    576.8,582.02
     time. Exactly. So the whole concept is how to learn how to treat yourself. So
},
{
    582.02,584.48
     watch the videos at the end if you're having trouble with your low back I'll
},
{
    584.48,586.04
     put that one on the end too.
},
{
    586.04,586.88
     Over there?
},
{
    586.88,587.84
     Well, I don't know, it'll be somewhere.
},
{
    587.84,588.68
     Okay.
},
{
    588.68,589.52
     All right, thanks.
},
{
    589.52,590.34
     Take care.
},
