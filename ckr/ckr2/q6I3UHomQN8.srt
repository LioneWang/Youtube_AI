     Hi, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.
},
{
    3.0,4.0
     Brad Heide, physical therapist.
},
{
    4.0,7.0
     And together we are the most famous physical therapists on the internet.
},
{
    7.0,9.0
     Oh, and I'll tell you, of course, Bob.
},
{
    9.0,12.0
     Brad, we're always talking about we want to make sure people stay strong.
},
{
    12.0,14.0
     That's part of the, you know, it's good to say it.
},
{
    14.0,15.0
     Strong like bull.
},
{
    15.0,17.0
     Strong like bull is what they were saying.
},
{
    17.0,19.0
     Anyway, we want to make sure you stay strong.
},
{
    19.0,21.0
     Every so often you might get an injury.
},
{
    21.0,23.0
     We hope not because you hope you're doing things right.
},
{
    23.0,28.52
     But let's say you hurt your bicep. All right very easy to tell because when you're lifting
},
{
    28.52,32.5
     something you're gonna feel it in the bicep and so quite often what you're
},
{
    32.5,37.58
     gonna find off is that these pains can be chronic sometimes they're nagging.
},
{
    37.58,41.38
     Like you go okay I'll let it rest for a couple weeks and I go back and try some
},
{
    41.38,48.24
     curls again. Boom it comes right back again. In those cases what often has happened is there was a minor tear in there and
},
{
    48.24,52.72
     lay down some scar tissue and what you're doing when you start lifting again
},
{
    52.72,56.44
     is you're breaking open that scar tissue. So this treatment is going to help you
},
{
    56.44,63.0
     heal or realign that scar tissue so that it's strong like bull. So it won't
},
{
    63.0,67.0
     tear open again. This works very well. We've used this for a number of injuries.
},
{
    67.0,74.0
     The sign is if you have pain when you're doing curls or if you do resistance like this and you feel pain,
},
{
    74.0,79.0
     the good sign is probably usually in the mid-muscle belly is what we're experiencing.
},
{
    79.0,82.0
     If you're feeling up here in the shoulder, we're going to do a video for that too.
},
{
    82.0,88.16
     That's shoulder bicep tendonitis, sure it'll all hit, but what you're going to do is get up here a little.
},
{
    88.16,92.76
     You want the muscles to relax so you're going to have a bent, the elbow bent, and
},
{
    92.76,97.52
     the hand up, palm up. Okay, you're going to find the tender spot now you're going
},
{
    97.52,102.2
     to use your other hand obviously, but you can take your fingers and you can put
},
{
    102.2,108.84
     one on top of the other like this or two together or three together. You want to just get a lot of, you can have a lot of strength needed
},
{
    108.84,114.04
     because this is not something where we're just moving the tissues here. We're getting
},
{
    114.04,118.72
     deep down in the muscle. Quite often from my understanding, a lot of us, it's often
},
{
    118.72,121.28
     the medial muscle belly.
},
{
    121.28,122.28
     Yeah, yeah.
},
{
    122.28,125.0
     And usually it's right about in the middle.
},
{
    125.0,130.0
     So you're going to go right in and you're going to get deep down in there and you're going to find that tender spot.
},
{
    130.0,133.0
     And you're going to push hard.
},
{
    133.0,134.0
     Okay?
},
{
    134.0,136.0
     It should hurt, but it shouldn't make you scream.
},
{
    136.0,137.0
     Right.
},
{
    137.0,143.0
     If you start doing this and after a minute of doing it, or a minute and a half, it's getting worse, you can't do it right now.
},
{
    143.0,150.08
     You're going to have to back off, put some ice on it, let it heal a little bit longer. What you want to see is that after a minute or two of doing it,
},
{
    150.08,154.08
     it actually starts to maybe lessen a little bit and maybe even get a little bit numb. Sure,
},
{
    154.08,160.24
     that's a good sign. And you can do this a long time. I mean, the recommendation is you could
},
{
    160.24,169.72
     do it up to 20 minutes. Nobody's going to be able to do this for 20 minutes. I found if you even do it for three, four, five, you know, try to get it in once a day,
},
{
    169.72,173.64
     you're going to be fine, you'll get plenty of good results from that.
},
{
    173.64,176.4
     So that's going to help realign those fibers.
},
{
    176.4,181.96
     You know, the fibers tend to lay down on scar tissue in an erratic fashion like a cobweb,
},
{
    181.96,184.44
     and that's going to realign them so they're real strong.
},
{
    184.44,189.28
     Right. All in line. Yeah, all in line. And next time then you start off with very
},
{
    189.28,192.88
     light weights and gradually work up to heavier weights but you're going to find
},
{
    192.88,196.52
     out that pain is no longer there. Sure. After doing this for a couple weeks.
},
{
    196.52,200.68
     So after I work this and I do it for four or five minutes these fingers get
},
{
    200.68,204.92
     tired that's a good time to go and then put a cold pack on it. That's fine.
},
{
    204.92,211.0
     Yep. And again you can do one finger over the top if you want to give yourself a little reinforcement if you want to.
},
{
    211.0,213.0
     Alright, no more bicep pain, right baby?
},
{
    213.0,215.0
     Oh no, strong right foot.
},
{
    215.0,255.34
     You can look cool. වවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවවව� Thank you.
