     How to Stick an ABG
},
{
    23.0,27.96
     An ABG test requires collecting a small sample of blood from an artery.
},
{
    27.96,32.4
     The sample must be obtained by either the respiratory therapist, doctor, or qualified
},
{
    32.4,34.16
     technician.
},
{
    34.16,38.28
     First and foremost, before sticking the patient, you must determine the best site for collecting
},
{
    38.28,40.12
     the blood sample.
},
{
    40.12,43.44
     Here are the possible ABG sample sites.
},
{
    43.44,49.8
     The radial artery in the wrist, the brachial artery in the upper arm, and the femoral artery
},
{
    49.8,51.88
     in the groin.
},
{
    51.88,57.44
     In addition, a blood sample can also be obtained in a pre-existing arterial line.
},
{
    57.44,63.28
     An ABG blood sample cannot be obtained from a vein, as this would instead be a VBG or
},
{
    63.28,65.7
     venous blood gas.
},
{
    65.7,69.9
     Once the site is determined, the respiratory therapist will then sterilize the injection
},
{
    69.9,74.4
     site using an antiseptic or antimicrobial solution.
},
{
    74.4,79.14
     The radial artery is the preferred site to stick the ABG because it has a good collateral
},
{
    79.14,83.02
     circulation and it is superficial and easy to palpate.
},
{
    83.02,88.0
     Also, it's not near any large veins and the stick is relatively pain-free.
},
{
    88.0,94.0
     But, I mean, you won't see me volunteering to have my radial artery stuck anytime soon.
},
{
    94.0,100.0
     Anyway, the patient will be positioned either lying down or sitting with the arm well supported.
},
{
    100.0,105.36
     You may use a rolled towel positioned under the patient's wrist in order to provide comfort
},
{
    105.36,109.36
     for the patient and to hyper-extend the side of the injection.
},
{
    109.36,114.08
     This position makes it easier to palpate the pulse and stick the artery.
},
{
    114.08,118.9
     After the radial artery is located, the respiratory therapist will then insert a sterile needle
},
{
    118.9,121.76
     into the artery to draw blood.
},
{
    121.76,126.2
     In some cases, the syringe needs to be repositioned in order to locate and puncture
},
{
    126.2,130.84
     the artery. When doing this, you will withdraw the tip of the syringe to the subcutaneous
},
{
    130.84,137.0
     tissue to prevent severing the artery or tendons and avoiding damage to the nearby tissues.
},
{
    137.0,140.68
     It's also extremely painful for the patient if you're digging around in their wrist with
},
{
    140.68,147.12
     a needle while trying to hit the artery. This is something I see a lot with students and new respiratory therapists.
},
{
    147.12,152.68
     Not to worry, you'll get better at sticking the arteries with more practice and experience.
},
{
    152.68,156.48
     Once the blood sample is obtained, a sterile gauze and bandage will be placed over the
},
{
    156.48,160.96
     punctured wound in order to stop bleeding and avoid infection.
},
{
    160.96,169.0
     The blood sample will immediately be sent to the laboratory for analysis. The specimen must be analyzed within 15 minutes after extraction
},
{
    169.0,172.1
     in order to ensure accurate ABG results are obtained.
},
{
    172.1,176.14
     It is important to keep in mind that an ABG stick
},
{
    176.14,179.28
     may be difficult to perform in uncooperative patients,
},
{
    179.28,183.28
     those with hard-to-find pulses, patients with cognitive impairment,
},
{
    183.28,185.26
     patients with tremimmers, and those
},
{
    185.26,188.76
     with a significant amount of body fat.
},
{
    188.76,192.64
     In some cases, multiple attempts are needed in order to draw the sample.
},
{
    192.64,197.56
     However, repeated puncture of a single site increases the prevalence of a hematoma, which
},
{
    197.56,202.24
     is swelling of clotted blood within the tissue, and also scarring.
},
{
    202.24,206.98
     In severe cases, it can also cut the artery and cause a significant amount of bleeding.
},
{
    206.98,209.26
     So you may need to use an alternate site
},
{
    209.26,210.74
     in order to draw the blood sample
},
{
    210.74,214.74
     if too many unsuccessful attempts are made in the same spot.
},
{
    214.74,216.62
     Again, collecting these blood samples
},
{
    216.62,219.66
     can be quite challenging for some respiratory therapist.
},
{
    219.66,222.5
     But as I always say, practice makes perfect.
},
{
    222.5,224.66
     And the more you do it, the easier it gets
},
{
    224.66,226.88
     and the better you become at sticking ABGs.
},
{
    226.88,234.88
     Alright guys, that pretty much wraps up everything you need to know about sticking an ABG.
