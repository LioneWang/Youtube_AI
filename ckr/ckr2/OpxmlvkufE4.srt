     Welcome back guys, today I want to show you some essential exercises you can do at home
},
{
    7.48,11.6
     or even at your desk at work that can prevent you from carpal tunnel syndrome or even maintain
},
{
    11.6,13.24
     mobility and flexibility in the wrist.
},
{
    13.24,17.16
     Now if you do have wrist pain or carpal tunnel syndrome, make sure you go see a doctor or
},
{
    17.16,19.64
     a chiropractor and get examined properly and get treated properly.
},
{
    19.64,21.48
     Wrist extension mobilization.
},
{
    21.48,28.2
     This is especially great if you struggle with front barbell squats, back barbell squats or even if you're a gymnast you should do these exercises to
},
{
    28.2,32.56
     keep mobility and flexibility. Make sure you lean forward and hold this stretch for about
},
{
    32.56,38.08
     30 to 60 seconds. Now to enhance the stretch, just lean forward in different angles. This
},
{
    38.08,42.48
     also stretches the wrist flexors. Now this will allow you to stretch more intra-articular
},
{
    42.48,47.0
     joints. Possibly start on a soft surface first and and then move on to a harder later on, so it's
},
{
    47.0,48.34
     easy on your wrists.
},
{
    48.34,50.18
     Wrist flexion mobilisations.
},
{
    50.18,51.54
     This one's a little bit harder.
},
{
    51.54,53.74
     Place the back of your hands on a flat surface.
},
{
    53.74,56.7
     This will stretch out the extensors in wrist flexion.
},
{
    56.7,58.58
     When you're ready, try to lean in different angles.
},
{
    58.58,60.5
     This will enhance the stretch much more better.
},
{
    60.5,64.26
     Try to hold the point of stretch for about 30 to 60 seconds, and then move on to the
},
{
    64.26,71.12
     next position. Wrist external stretches. Place your palms down on a flat surface pointing them outwards now lean from side to side
},
{
    71.12,76.0
     This is a fantastic routine, especially if you do a lot of hand balancing especially in gymnastics
},
{
    76.0,79.16
     This will mobilize the wrist and stretch out the wrist flexors as well
},
{
    79.16,83.96
     This would be great to prevent you from repetitive stress disorder, which is basically like carpal tunnel syndrome
},
{
    83.96,86.4
     When you're ready try to stretch out in different angles.
},
{
    87.12,91.2
     Wrist rolls. You might find this a little bit confusing, but I'll try my best to actually
},
{
    91.2,95.76
     explain this to you. First, interlace your fingers together. Then, as you bring your elbows together,
},
{
    95.76,100.24
     rotate your wrist in a circular manner. Don't forget to do the opposite direction as well.
},
{
    100.24,104.72
     Do about 20 clockwise rotations, and then go and do counterclockwise rotations.
},
{
    104.72,106.66
     And then do this about three times.
},
{
    106.66,110.64
     These are a great warm-up exercise, especially if you do a lot of strenuous work, because
},
{
    110.64,115.08
     it creates a bit of stretching in the intra-articular joints, and it also warms up the joints as
},
{
    115.08,116.52
     well and lubricates them.
},
{
    116.52,117.52
     Wrist Waves.
},
{
    117.52,120.68
     These are basically another mobilization exercise.
},
{
    120.68,125.86
     First interlace your fingers, and then try to create a wave and do this about 20 times.
},
{
    125.86,127.72
     And don't forget to go the other way as well.
},
{
    127.72,132.52
     This exercise helps you dynamically mobilize your wrist in flexion and extension.
},
{
    132.52,136.76
     Once again, this exercise is fantastic for strenuous movements, for example, weight lifting,
},
{
    136.76,139.0
     jodastics and even office works as well.
},
{
    139.0,142.0
     And it can definitely prevent you from carpal tunnel syndrome.
},
{
    142.0,143.24
     Static wrist stretches.
},
{
    143.24,147.32
     Now this is the wrist flexor stretch. With your fingers pointing up and your elbow is locked in,
},
{
    147.32,148.8
     grab the fingers with your other hand
},
{
    148.8,150.64
     and then pull it back at the point of stretch.
},
{
    150.64,152.92
     Now hold the stretch for about 30 to 60 seconds.
},
{
    152.92,154.52
     This is the wrist extensor stretch.
},
{
    154.52,156.24
     Now with your fingers pointing downwards,
},
{
    156.24,157.16
     now with your other hand,
},
{
    157.16,159.08
     pull your fingers back at the point of stretch
},
{
    159.08,162.64
     and hold that stretch for about 30 to 60 seconds.
},
{
    162.64,163.48
     Both of these stretches
},
{
    163.48,167.08
     will definitely help prevent carpal tunnel syndrome and even prevent repetitive
},
{
    167.08,168.44
     stress injuries as well.
},
{
    169.84,172.1
