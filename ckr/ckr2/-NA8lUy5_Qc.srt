     If you want to lose your gains in the fastest way possible then it's simple, get injured.
},
{
    8.66,12.52
     Because nothing is going to set you back more than injuries will in your quest to build
},
{
    12.52,14.34
     muscle and lose fat.
},
{
    14.34,19.12
     With the shoulder injury is not only being one of the most common injuries lifters experience,
},
{
    19.12,23.84
     but also one of the worst injuries for your gains since it often prevents you from doing
},
{
    23.84,26.28
     any upper body training whatsoever.
},
{
    26.28,29.04
     So how can you prevent this from happening?
},
{
    29.04,34.28
     Well, aside from choosing the right exercises and performing them correctly, there's also
},
{
    34.28,39.58
     a key set of four muscles surrounding the shoulder joint collectively termed the rotator
},
{
    39.58,45.34
     cuff that lifters often unknowingly overlook, leading to these muscles becoming underdeveloped
},
{
    45.34,46.7
     and weak as a result.
},
{
    46.7,48.98
     This is detrimental since these four muscles
},
{
    48.98,51.98
     collectively act to help stabilize your shoulder joint
},
{
    51.98,54.5
     during the various pushing and pulling movements
},
{
    54.5,55.94
     you perform in the gym.
},
{
    55.94,57.74
     And when these muscles become weak,
},
{
    57.74,59.9
     it causes a great deal of instability
},
{
    59.9,61.58
     in the shoulder during your lifts,
},
{
    61.58,64.34
     which often leads to shoulder pain, impigement,
},
{
    64.34,67.2
     and eventually even rotator cuff tears.
},
{
    67.2,71.68
     And although these muscles do get indirectly worked in many of the gym exercises that you're
},
{
    71.68,76.4
     doing, they often end up getting taken over by stronger muscle groups like the delts in
},
{
    76.4,80.94
     the chest, which creates harmful imbalances in your shoulders over time.
},
{
    80.94,85.04
     Meaning that you should be directly training and strengthening the rotator cuff,
},
{
    85.04,89.64
     because by doing so you'll be better able to prevent shoulder injury from occurring,
},
{
    89.64,94.2
     alleviate any shoulder pain that you're currently feeling, and likely boost your strength in
},
{
    94.2,96.36
     the gym as well.
},
{
    96.36,100.88
     But in order to best strengthen these four muscles and bulletproof your shoulders, it's
},
{
    100.88,105.22
     vital that you both choose the right exercises for each of them and perform them
},
{
    105.22,106.64
     in the right manner.
},
{
    106.64,111.32
     And in this video, with the help of current scientific literature and or anatomical understanding
},
{
    111.32,116.32
     of these muscles, that's exactly what I'll show you how to do.
},
{
    116.32,121.2
     The first exercise is something called the full can, which is going to target the supraspinatus
},
{
    121.2,123.24
     muscle of the rotator cuff.
},
{
    123.24,128.68
     And this exercise is likely your best bet for strengthening this muscle since it's shown
},
{
    128.68,135.48
     in a 2007 EMG analysis when compared to other rotator cuff exercises, the full can elicits
},
{
    135.48,142.4
     a high amount of EMG activity of the supraspinatus with the least amount of deltoid activity.
},
{
    142.4,145.92
     Which is beneficial as this has been shown to reduce shear force
},
{
    145.92,150.88
     placed on the shoulder joint and better help strengthen the rotator cuff without having
},
{
    150.88,154.12
     the deltoid compensate by overpowering it.
},
{
    154.12,158.68
     But in order to maximize the effectiveness of this exercise, it's crucial that you perform
},
{
    158.68,161.52
     the full can exercise correctly.
},
{
    161.52,165.92
     Start with your arms by your sides with a set of light weights in your hand.
},
{
    165.92,170.04
     Keep your arms straight and raise them up in the scapular plan as shown here, which is
},
{
    170.04,173.88
     about 30 degrees from directly sideways.
},
{
    173.88,178.0
     Point your thumbs up towards the ceiling and raise your arms up until you reach your round
},
{
    178.0,182.0
     shoulder height. Since research has shown that this is the range of motion where the
},
{
    182.0,189.0
     supraspinatus is most active. Pause at the top position for a second or two before lowering down.
},
{
    189.0,192.64
     And as you perform the movement, you'll want to keep your shoulder blades pinned together
},
{
    192.64,197.96
     and pulled down, as research indicates that this both increases joint space and allows
},
{
    197.96,203.92
     you to strengthen the supraspinatus in a more mechanical advantageous position. In addition,
},
{
    203.92,208.52
     as you raise, avoid shrugging your shoulders up and instead, keep them down
},
{
    208.52,214.14
     with your upper traps remaining as relaxed as possible throughout each rep.
},
{
    214.14,218.0
     Implementing the aforementioned tips will help you best strengthen the supraspinatus
},
{
    218.0,222.06
     while minimizing any compensations from other stronger muscle groups.
},
{
    222.06,225.44
     I'd suggest starting out with lighter weight for two to three sets of
},
{
    225.44,231.2
     15 to 20 reps with a focus on form and then over time continue progressing from there.
},
{
    232.64,238.64
     The next exercise, sideline external rotation, is going to be used to target the two posterior
},
{
    238.64,248.36
     rotator cuff muscles at once, the infraspinatus and the teres minor. And this exercise is your best bet at doing so since as shown in the following two weekend
},
{
    248.36,254.48
     g-grass from a 2004 analysis of the rotator cuff muscles, this exercise elicits the highest
},
{
    254.48,260.96
     infraspinatus and teres minor activation when compared to several other rotator cuff exercises,
},
{
    260.96,265.06
     in addition to having the lowest strain on the shoulder joint as well.
},
{
    265.06,269.28
     But again, to reap the full benefits of this exercise, it's vital that you perform it
},
{
    269.28,270.36
     correctly.
},
{
    270.36,275.28
     To start, assume a sideline position with a towel roll pinned between your top side
},
{
    275.28,277.04
     arm and rib cage.
},
{
    277.04,281.4
     The towel is a really important step since research has shown that adding a towel roll
},
{
    281.4,285.28
     to the exercise boosts EMG activation of the two posterior
},
{
    285.28,291.08
     rotator cuff muscles by roughly 20% as it helps minimize any movement compensation from
},
{
    291.08,296.44
     a current. Next, pull your shoulder blades back and down and keep them this way as you
},
{
    296.44,301.92
     start doing reps. Start with your arm parallel to the floor and then while keeping your
},
{
    301.92,309.12
     elbow pinned to your side, slowly externally rotate outwards by pulling your hand up towards the ceiling.
},
{
    309.12,311.92
     And then return back down to parallel and repeat.
},
{
    311.92,316.76
     You want to focus on avoiding letting the elbow drift up off your side as you raise
},
{
    316.76,320.48
     the weight, as this will start involving more of the deltoids.
},
{
    320.48,325.06
     Instead, keep the elbow locked in place against the towel at your side as you perform each
},
{
    325.06,326.06
     rep.
},
{
    326.06,330.86
     But if you struggle to do so or you feel pain at the very top position, then you can start
},
{
    330.86,336.02
     with partial reps in a pain-free zone and then progressively increase the range of motion
},
{
    336.02,337.7
     from there over time.
},
{
    337.7,342.7
     As such I start out with a lighter weight or even no weight at first for 2-3 sets of
},
{
    342.7,346.2
     15-20 reps each side, and then progressing from there
},
{
    346.2,348.6
     as you get stronger.
},
{
    348.6,352.8
     For the last exercise, we're going to move on to something called the external rotation
},
{
    352.8,359.52
     press, which is going to challenge and strengthen all 4 rotator cuff muscles to a certain degree.
},
{
    359.52,363.8
     Now while the prior 2 exercises are great at strengthening the various rotator cuff
},
{
    363.8,365.12
     muscles, many of
},
{
    365.12,370.0
     the movements lifters perform in the gym take place above shoulder height in positions where
},
{
    370.0,374.24
     the shoulder joint becomes more vulnerable to instability and injury.
},
{
    374.24,378.96
     Therefore it is vital to include this exercise to enhance your shoulder stability by training
},
{
    378.96,384.04
     the rotator cuff muscles in a more functional manner.
},
{
    384.04,388.92
     To perform it, get down on one knee with an upright posture and grab either a band or
},
{
    388.92,393.24
     a cable handle attachment set at roughly shoulder height.
},
{
    393.24,398.6
     Pull the cable towards you in a rowing motion with your elbow kept high at shoulder height.
},
{
    398.6,402.64
     Your hand should now be directly in front of your elbow with your arm parallel to the
},
{
    402.64,403.64
     ground.
},
{
    403.64,405.2
     Hold this position briefly and then
},
{
    405.2,410.4
     externally rotate the shoulder by bringing the hand up towards the ceiling with the elbow still
},
{
    410.4,417.36
     locked in the same place. Next, press your arm up overhead and hold the top position briefly. Then
},
{
    417.36,422.88
     reverse the pattern and repeat for more reps. Throughout the movement your rotator cuff muscles
},
{
    422.88,427.76
     will be working hard to counteract the resistance by pulling your arm forward.
},
{
    427.76,431.92
     But as you perform each rep, you'll want to avoid compensating by arching the lower
},
{
    431.92,433.6
     back as you press up.
},
{
    433.6,438.92
     Instead, keep the core tight and contracted to maintain a neutral back as you perform
},
{
    438.92,439.92
     the movement.
},
{
    439.92,445.56
     I suggest starting out with light resistance for roughly 2-3 sets of 10-15 reps with a
},
{
    445.56,450.2
     focus on slow and controlled execution for each rep.
},
{
    450.2,454.52
     Now some of you canes may have noticed with the previous exercise selection that one of
},
{
    454.52,459.12
     the rotator cuff muscles, the subscapularis, hasn't really been emphasized as much as
},
{
    459.12,460.92
     the other three have.
},
{
    460.92,467.0
     And this is for good reason, since the subscapularis is the only rotator cuff that performs internal
},
{
    467.0,472.36
     rotation of the shoulder, which most people actually have too much of from poor posture
},
{
    472.36,477.32
     and or from the many pressing movements in the gym that involve internal rotation.
},
{
    477.32,482.8
     So in this case, it would be best not to emphasize the subscapularis as much and instead focus
},
{
    482.8,485.52
     more so on the other three rotator cuff muscles
},
{
    485.52,491.6
     responsible for external rotation, which is exactly what we've done. So with that being said,
},
{
    491.6,496.56
     here is the full rotator cuff strengthening routine that you can do using the exercises
},
{
    496.56,501.44
     previously discussed. I'd suggest doing this routine roughly two to three times per week,
},
{
    501.44,506.4
     but it's absolutely vital that you treat your rotator cuff muscles just like any other
},
{
    506.4,511.84
     muscle group by progressing these exercises over time as you continue to get stronger.
},
{
    511.84,514.74
     Otherwise you'll honestly just be wasting your time.
