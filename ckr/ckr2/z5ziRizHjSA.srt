     People always ask us in the event of a mass casualty incident, what could they do?
},
{
    10.44,12.2
     What could they do differently?
},
{
    12.2,17.46
     Today I'm going to talk about the few little things that people can do to save a life.
},
{
    17.46,28.92
     In the event that somebody is bleeding in a place where you can act to save their life. The first thing you can do is take a jacket,
},
{
    28.92,33.3
     take something soft and you're going to apply it to where they're bleeding. If it's their
},
{
    33.3,37.28
     arms, legs or where they attach, you're going to just simply place it on the area that's
},
{
    37.28,44.14
     bleeding and push really hard and hold it until help comes or the bleeding stops. If
},
{
    44.14,48.0
     help doesn't come right away and you need to sustain this and you're tired,
},
{
    48.0,54.0
     you can either secure it with an ace wrap or a belt or anything that's going to hold that pressure in place.
},
{
    54.0,60.0
     At the very least, switch out with somebody else who can maintain the pressure until help arrives.
},
{
    60.0,64.0
     The Hemorrhage Control Kit is very, very simple.
},
{
    64.0,75.24
     The ones that we have here at Bumsy say traumatic bleeding and on the other side have the instructions.
},
{
    75.24,81.28
     So even in a bad situation when people are panicking they can see the pictures and know
},
{
    81.28,82.38
     what to do.
},
{
    82.38,83.84
     It's very simple.
},
{
    83.84,86.32
     Within this kit are all the tools
},
{
    86.32,88.68
     that you need to make this happen.
},
{
    88.68,92.96
     So if you've got somebody who is bleeding from a bad wound,
},
{
    92.96,96.28
     and we're gonna say for instance, this is on their leg,
},
{
    96.28,99.12
     and I have access to this kit,
},
{
    99.12,101.56
     and somebody has been holding pressure,
},
{
    101.56,103.2
     someone brings the kit,
},
{
    103.2,107.72
     and now I need to move to a tourniquet in order to stop the bleeding.
},
{
    107.72,113.28
     I have the ability to take this tourniquet, open it up,
},
{
    113.28,118.88
     place it above the wound, turn.
},
{
    118.88,121.4
     And people ask, how many times do you turn?
},
{
    121.4,123.48
     You turn until the bleeding stops,
},
{
    123.48,134.64
     and you'll see that it's actually a very physical thing. Secure it and over. If you're lucky enough to have
},
{
    134.64,139.56
     a pen, you can write the time here but I don't really care where you put it. Just
},
{
    139.56,142.56
     make note of the time it helps with decision-making when the patient is
},
{
    142.56,150.8
     taken to the emergency department to get further care. If you have something that is within a shoulder or you're
},
{
    150.8,160.4
     unable to put a tourniquet on, the reason why we have gauze and this combat gauze is
},
{
    160.4,166.92
     what they call that or quick clot is that then you can pack the wound and stop
},
{
    166.92,169.72
     the bleeding by constructing the vessels on the inside.
},
{
    169.72,173.08
     Well, that sounds kind of complicated, but basically all you're doing is putting pressure
},
{
    173.08,175.8
     on the inside instead of pressure on the outside.
},
{
    175.8,191.36
     And again, what you do is you open up this package and you would pack the wound until you cannot do it anymore.
},
{
    191.36,194.46
     And at that point you're going to hold pressure.
},
{
    194.46,199.92
     And again you're going to hold pressure for at least two to four minutes, if not longer,
},
{
    199.92,205.0
     sometimes up to ten minutes, or until help arrives.
},
{
    205.0,210.0
     What you've done is you've given that person every opportunity to survive in a bad situation.
},
{
    210.0,213.0
     This is just a few steps that you can do.
},
{
    213.0,218.0
     It doesn't guarantee that there will be a bad outcome or a good outcome.
},
{
    218.0,223.0
     It just means that there's something that you can do to help in a time of need.
},
