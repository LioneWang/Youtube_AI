     Bob and Brad, the two most famous physical therapists
},
{
    6.7,8.02
     on the internet.
},
{
    9.7,11.52
     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.
},
{
    11.52,12.84
     Brad Heineck, physical therapist.
},
{
    12.84,15.6
     We are the most famous physical therapists on the internet.
},
{
    15.6,17.28
     In our opinion, of course, Bob.
},
{
    17.28,20.32
     Now we just showed you a video on whether or not
},
{
    20.32,24.0
     your head, the headache is coming from your neck.
},
{
    24.0,26.52
     If it is, these are, we're gonna show you top seven
},
{
    26.52,30.52
     exercises for neck pain and headache or neck headaches,
},
{
    30.52,31.84
     whatever you wanna refer to.
},
{
    31.84,34.76
     The headaches are from the neck, typically the upper neck.
},
{
    34.76,37.68
     Yeah, and it's called a cervical genic headache.
},
{
    37.68,40.36
     Meaning, cervical, meaning neck.
},
{
    40.36,43.08
     That's where the genic, that's where the origin is.
},
{
    43.08,45.88
     So it's caused by the nerves,
},
{
    45.88,47.8
     the bones or the muscles in your neck.
},
{
    47.8,50.16
     I'm not gonna get any more detail than that.
},
{
    50.16,51.92
     But you feel in your head,
},
{
    51.92,53.36
     but it's coming from the neck.
},
{
    53.36,54.2
     It's referred.
},
{
    54.2,55.92
     So we got seven exercises.
},
{
    55.92,58.42
     Pick one or two that are helpful
},
{
    58.42,62.0
     and you can perform these as much as six to eight times a day.
},
{
    62.0,64.24
     And that's where you're gonna have more success.
},
{
    64.24,66.62
     And luckily a lot of these you can do,
},
{
    66.62,70.0
     you know, through your work day, if you sit in a chair even.
},
{
    70.0,73.36
     Right, you don't have to have a special seat
},
{
    73.36,76.96
     or go off into some unusual position.
},
{
    76.96,80.68
     Brad, why don't you show chin tucks from the side there
},
{
    80.68,83.24
     and I'll show it from the front there.
},
{
    83.24,87.0
     So the first one is, as Brad and I have mentioned
},
{
    87.0,91.04
     a few million times throughout our video life here,
},
{
    91.04,92.88
     we're gonna start with a chin tuck.
},
{
    92.88,97.24
     And these can, I've had people that use these alone
},
{
    97.24,98.52
     and it took away their headache.
},
{
    98.52,102.28
     So basically you're gonna tuck your chin,
},
{
    102.28,105.0
     you're moving your head back.
},
{
    106.36,107.6
     Brad's gonna be able to show up better.
},
{
    107.6,109.52
     But wait by way, you have to make sure it's all, yeah.
},
{
    109.52,114.16
     A firm chair, upright back rest, hand, arm rest are optional.
},
{
    114.16,116.64
     Scoot your bottom back in, shoulders back,
},
{
    116.64,120.6
     and get pop, good posture before you start this.
},
{
    120.6,124.56
     And then tuck in, so it's not down like this,
},
{
    124.56,126.32
     it's a common mistake or.
},
{
    126.32,127.72
     Up like that, yeah.
},
{
    127.72,129.28
     It's straight back.
},
{
    129.28,131.56
     Now Brad's got pretty good motion there already.
},
{
    131.56,133.52
     You may find that you have very little,
},
{
    133.52,136.0
     and that's why you're having headaches.
},
{
    136.0,140.72
     So, you know, if you only have a slight bit of motion,
},
{
    140.72,144.16
     like a bit of translation, start with that little movement
},
{
    144.16,148.24
     and you can actually add some over pressure, right?
},
{
    148.24,151.48
     And that's number two, this is the second exercise.
},
{
    151.48,153.32
     You can actually take your fingers
},
{
    153.32,155.76
     or you can take the web of your hand and thumb
},
{
    155.76,158.48
     and push it back like that.
},
{
    158.48,162.24
     Now, with this case spread, quite often what helps
},
{
    162.24,167.64
     with headaches is actually to hold it for 30 to 45 seconds.
},
{
    167.64,169.92
     And let that put her on.
},
{
    169.92,173.44
     And if the pain gets worse, obviously you stop it.
},
{
    173.44,175.3
     And if it doesn't get worse,
},
{
    175.3,178.6
     you can actually do that for up to two minutes spread.
},
{
    178.6,180.32
     You can actually hold it for two minutes.
},
{
    180.32,181.76
     You'll know, cause it's gonna continue to feel good.
},
{
    181.76,182.88
     Yeah, it's gonna feel good.
},
{
    182.88,185.28
     Like, oh, that's not what I've been looking for.
},
{
    185.28,188.24
     So, you're not gonna go in right away
},
{
    188.24,190.02
     and push really hard on this.
},
{
    190.02,192.44
     You know, you start out gentle and see how it responds.
},
{
    192.44,195.28
     If it feels better as you put more pressure on it,
},
{
    195.28,196.92
     then you can go a little more.
},
{
    196.92,199.92
     Now, another thing quite often that we find,
},
{
    199.92,203.36
     and when we try to determine whether or not your headache
},
{
    203.36,204.64
     is coming from the neck,
},
{
    204.64,206.08
     we actually had you do a test
},
{
    206.08,208.64
     where you see what your rotation is like.
},
{
    208.64,212.68
     And quite often, a limitation in rotation
},
{
    212.68,215.76
     can cause pain in the neck.
},
{
    215.76,219.0
     So let's say, let's see, I wanna figure out which way.
},
{
    219.0,220.12
     I'm gonna try this way.
},
{
    220.12,221.92
     Let's say I'm limited to the right.
},
{
    221.92,225.56
     I can go normal to the left, but to the right I start,
},
{
    225.56,228.22
     oh, it hurts even when I go that direction.
},
{
    228.22,230.4
     What you're gonna do is take a towel,
},
{
    230.4,234.04
     and ideally you use one with salvage on it,
},
{
    234.04,236.44
     and that's woven material on the end.
},
{
    236.44,237.28
     The edge of the towel.
},
{
    237.28,238.34
     The edge of the towel.
},
{
    238.34,240.8
     They all have it, unless it's a torn one.
},
{
    240.8,244.32
     And you're gonna try to get up fairly high on the neck,
},
{
    244.32,246.0
     right in the sub-excipital area,
},
{
    246.0,249.24
     or what we call right the base of the skull.
},
{
    249.24,251.88
     Yep, and this one, you should really have
},
{
    251.88,253.4
     a longer towel, Brad, than this.
},
{
    253.4,254.68
     Yeah, that's a little short.
},
{
    254.68,256.08
     This one's a little short.
},
{
    256.08,258.78
     But what I would do is, I actually,
},
{
    258.78,262.56
     I bring the towel edge up to my eyes almost.
},
{
    262.56,264.76
     They start at the base of my head,
},
{
    264.76,266.1
     at the base of my neck, I'm sorry, start at the base of my head, at the base of my neck, I'm sorry,
},
{
    266.1,268.14
     I mean the base of my skull,
},
{
    268.14,271.02
     but they move up because that's the
},
{
    271.02,273.26
     orientation of the vertebrae.
},
{
    273.26,276.72
     So I'm gonna switch hands here actually.
},
{
    276.72,279.32
     I'm gonna take and grab with this hand
},
{
    279.32,281.32
     and the other hand grabs the other side
},
{
    281.32,283.24
     and that gets pulled down.
},
{
    284.76,285.6
     Okay, the side.
},
{
    285.6,287.12
     I'm doing a towel roll.
},
{
    287.12,289.44
     Doesn't always work as good, but sometimes it helps.
},
{
    289.44,290.68
     Yeah, you can do, you can try that too.
},
{
    290.68,291.52
     Yep.
},
{
    291.52,292.34
     And then you're gonna, yeah,
},
{
    292.34,294.92
     you don't wanna make sure the shoulder's to go with you.
},
{
    294.92,297.44
     It's just, you're gonna bring it across like this.
},
{
    298.68,301.56
     It's going across the cheek, up to the eyes.
},
{
    303.0,307.84
     And you're gonna, this should be, by the way, completely pain-free.
},
{
    307.84,310.46
     If this makes your pain worse, you're not gonna do it.
},
{
    310.46,313.64
     And, but quite often what we find with this support
},
{
    313.64,315.84
     that it feels better.
},
{
    315.84,318.52
     And you're able to actually move without the pain.
},
{
    318.52,322.24
     So this arm is pulling down, it's not pulling across,
},
{
    322.24,323.44
     it's pulling down.
},
{
    323.44,327.64
     And this one's pulling across. if you go and blow your chin,
},
{
    327.64,328.68
     you just choke yourself.
},
{
    328.68,330.48
     So it's not a good idea.
},
{
    330.48,332.52
     You can actually have someone give you
},
{
    332.52,333.88
     a little extra push too.
},
{
    333.88,335.16
     I thought you wanted to do a high five.
},
{
    335.16,336.48
     Yeah.
},
{
    336.48,338.56
     But that may be too advanced for you.
},
{
    338.56,342.6
     Yeah, that person may not be into with it.
},
{
    342.6,344.2
     So give that a try.
},
{
    344.2,345.82
     You'd go the opposite direction.
},
{
    345.82,348.46
     You'd, you know, switch your hands and go that way.
},
{
    348.46,350.62
     I don't want to do it because I'm gonna hit my mic,
},
{
    350.62,352.26
     but you can get that a shot too.
},
{
    352.26,354.38
     So five to 10 repetitions.
},
{
    354.38,355.98
     See how it feels.
},
{
    355.98,357.38
     If it feels all right,
},
{
    357.38,359.14
     you can keep doing this throughout the day.
},
{
    359.14,361.54
     It also, you know, six to eight times a day.
},
{
    361.54,362.78
     All right.
},
{
    362.78,366.4
     Next one is sometimes you have tightness in there,
},
{
    366.4,369.32
     so maybe a little bit of flexion with over pressure.
},
{
    369.32,373.68
     So you take both hands, the back of our upper part
},
{
    373.68,377.28
     of your head, and just your fingertips,
},
{
    377.28,379.64
     and gently pull forward like this.
},
{
    381.88,384.8
     I'm not always a big fan of this one, Brad, but.
},
{
    384.8,385.68
     So sometimes. And Kenzie fan of this one, Brad, but. So yeah, sometimes.
},
{
    385.68,388.04
     You can see he did mention this one, so.
},
{
    388.04,388.88
     You can try it.
},
{
    388.88,391.8
     If it makes things worse, we definitely stop.
},
{
    391.8,392.96
     Stop right away, right?
},
{
    392.96,394.8
     That's the key on that one.
},
{
    394.8,398.72
     Now, another way to do flexion, we're on number five,
},
{
    398.72,401.84
     I think, Brad, is you can actually take your fist.
},
{
    401.84,403.8
     I like to put it upside down like this,
},
{
    403.8,406.12
     the thumb pointing towards the floor, and you can put it your fist. I like to put it upside down like this, the thumb pointing towards the floor,
},
{
    406.12,407.8
     and you can put it under your chin,
},
{
    407.8,410.1
     and you can pull forward that way.
},
{
    410.1,411.38
     And you gotta do it gently,
},
{
    411.38,414.66
     because you can actually get quite a bit of leverage that way.
},
{
    414.66,417.26
     You can actually, but that's a different way
},
{
    417.26,418.98
     to get a little more stretch.
},
{
    418.98,420.1
     That's a mulligan technique.
},
{
    420.1,422.58
     Your fist is actually between your jawbone
},
{
    422.58,424.1
     and right on the top of the sternum,
},
{
    424.1,426.48
     where you have that little hollow spot.
},
{
    426.48,427.76
     It's just a leveraged point
},
{
    427.76,429.88
     so that you're actually putting a little bit of traction
},
{
    429.88,431.72
     on that part, stretching it.
},
{
    431.72,435.16
     Brad, if you wanna flip and face this way
},
{
    435.16,438.04
     and show how you can do circular massages
},
{
    438.04,440.64
     and spleen massage.
},
{
    440.64,441.92
     Yeah, I'm gonna take my mic off.
},
{
    441.92,442.76
     Okay.
},
{
    442.76,444.92
     It's just a part of it.
},
{
    444.92,448.4
     I'll talk here. So what Brad's doing is you do first
},
{
    448.4,455.0
     circles right where the neck meets the skull and this really can you know quite often find the
},
{
    455.0,461.0
     side that's one side that's a lot more painful but it's amazing on this how how you can really
},
{
    461.0,466.0
     decrease the pain levels and decrease the stress in the neck and the muscles
},
{
    466.0,469.48
     by doing just some simple self massage.
},
{
    469.48,471.96
     You wanna do kind of a spleen one, two, Brad?
},
{
    471.96,474.76
     Yep, so he puts the figures together
},
{
    474.76,476.12
     and he pulls them apart.
},
{
    477.08,479.2
     And you kind of do this one, two, Brad,
},
{
    479.2,481.2
     where you do it on the neck too, don't you?
},
{
    481.2,482.04
     Oh yeah.
},
{
    482.04,482.88
     Yeah, yeah.
},
{
    482.88,483.72
     Down lower.
},
{
    483.72,486.4
     Down lower, yeah, he'd pull it, pull it to the, yeah. I don't know if everybody's hearing me or hearing me. Yeah, down lower. Down lower, yeah, he pulled, well, it's like, yeah.
},
{
    486.4,487.52
     I don't know if everybody's hearing me or not.
},
{
    487.52,489.16
     Yeah, people are probably not hearing you,
},
{
    489.16,492.0
     but just experiment around with it.
},
{
    492.0,493.92
     You can't hurt things.
},
{
    493.92,495.72
     You just go ahead and give it a try
},
{
    495.72,497.52
     and see if it feels better.
},
{
    497.52,501.32
     The last one is just a different way of doing the chin tucks.
},
{
    501.32,503.84
     I actually take two tennis balls
},
{
    503.84,506.56
     and put them in a sock like this.
},
{
    506.56,509.08
     And then throw it away.
},
{
    509.08,511.16
     Then I throw it away.
},
{
    511.16,512.76
     Brad, you don't mind moving a little bit.
},
{
    512.76,513.96
     Oh no, let's get out of the way.
},
{
    513.96,518.08
     So you put it right in that sub-excipital area again
},
{
    519.08,522.52
     and you can actually roll it a little bit.
},
{
    522.52,524.6
     Actually works pretty good, Brad.
},
{
    524.6,526.92
     You can do a little massage in there.
},
{
    526.92,528.84
     And then you can do some chin ducks.
},
{
    530.96,532.92
     Chin ducks while you're on it.
},
{
    532.92,535.08
     It feels good to roll it Brad, I'm surprised.
},
{
    535.08,538.24
     You could try, Bobby act like you never did it before.
},
{
    538.24,539.08
     I did.
},
{
    539.08,542.16
     It's the first time I've done it.
},
{
    542.16,543.84
     But it actually feels quite good.
},
{
    543.84,545.96
     Yeah, so the balls are close together.
},
{
    545.96,547.92
     Sometimes on a bed it's too soft,
},
{
    547.92,549.96
     you may have to do it like on a carpeted floor.
},
{
    549.96,550.96
     Sure.
},
{
    550.96,551.8
     It works all the way out.
},
{
    551.8,553.52
     Yeah, I agree 100% Brad.
},
{
    553.52,557.52
     So that's seven things, seven exercises.
},
{
    557.52,561.44
     Give the ones a try that if they are helping,
},
{
    561.44,562.96
     you continue to do them again
},
{
    562.96,564.92
     as much as six to eight times a day.
},
{
    564.92,568.16
     I knew a girl that actually worked for me
},
{
    568.16,570.8
     who would do the chin ducks in the car.
},
{
    570.8,572.0
     I think that's safe to do.
},
{
    572.0,573.08
     You can do a chin duck.
},
{
    573.08,574.92
     And she'd do them on the way to work
},
{
    574.92,576.92
     and she would have a headache.
},
{
    576.92,577.84
     So.
},
{
    577.84,580.12
     I had someone at a talk I was given
},
{
    580.12,582.44
     to a bunch of about 30 people
},
{
    582.44,584.84
     and I talked about just getting rid of the headaches
},
{
    584.84,586.8
     and I had her come up and I said, try this.
},
{
    586.8,588.08
     And I was kind of rolling the dice.
},
{
    588.08,588.92
     Yeah, you were rolling the dice.
},
{
    588.92,589.8
     And it worked, man.
},
{
    589.8,592.0
     She said, oh, my head feels so much better.
},
{
    592.0,592.84
     Yeah.
},
{
    592.84,594.0
     Yeah.
},
{
    594.0,595.44
     It was kind of fun.
},
{
    595.44,598.36
     By the way, if you're, this video is a part of a series
},
{
    598.36,600.48
     videos on neck pain.
},
{
    600.48,603.44
     So if you want to see the rest of the series,
},
{
    603.44,606.76
     go to bobandbrad.com, go to the program section
},
{
    606.76,608.16
     and look for neck pain.
},
{
    608.16,612.36
     And we got a whole series of videos, like 30 videos.
},
{
    612.36,614.2
     We're uploading them now so that I might not
},
{
    614.2,615.04
     all be there yet.
},
{
    615.04,619.64
     And you can just watch the ones that pertain to you.
},
{
    619.64,620.92
     Right, just pick the right title.
},
{
    620.92,622.32
     They're about 10 minutes long.
},
{
    622.32,625.4
     And the big benefit that I don't think anybody else does
},
{
    625.4,629.52
     is we provide a printout, PDF printout on paper
},
{
    629.52,632.76
     of a preview or a review of the whole video
},
{
    632.76,634.12
     with exercises on there.
},
{
    634.12,636.56
     So you will have it for your memory.
},
{
    636.56,638.08
     And how much do we charge a breath?
},
{
    638.08,640.8
     Well, Bob, we do ask for a smile.
},
{
    640.8,641.84
     Yeah, that's right.
},
{
    641.84,643.24
     With Gerald, it's all free.
},
{
    643.24,645.72
     It's all free and we don't even ask for an email. That's right. This is from our heart to yours. Wow, that's right. It's all free. It's all free and we don't even ask for an email.
},
{
    645.72,646.56
     That's right.
},
{
    646.56,648.32
     This is from our heart to yours.
},
{
    648.32,649.16
     Wow, Bob.
},
{
    649.16,650.0
     I don't know.
},
{
    650.0,651.28
     The balance hang is coming up.
},
{
    651.28,653.4
     You must be getting ready to talk to your wife that way.
},
{
    653.4,654.36
     That's right.
},
{
    654.36,None
     I'm practicing. you
