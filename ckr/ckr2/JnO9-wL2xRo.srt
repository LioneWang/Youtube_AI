     Hey everybody, it's Dr. Jo and sweet Cali.
},
{
    4.2,7.88
     And today I'm going to show you stretches and exercises for bowed legs.
},
{
    7.88,9.04
     So let's get started.
},
{
    9.04,11.72
     Disclaimer alert, disclaimer alert.

{

     subscribe button because it helps my channel grow and it allows me to continue to make videos for everybody. So with bowed legs sometimes this is a bone issue and if it's a bone issue,
},
{
    30.72,35.12
     something you've had all your life or because the bone is degenerating, stretches and exercises
},
{
    35.12,40.0
     probably aren't going to help but if this is coming from weak or tight hip muscles these
},
{
    40.0,48.36
     exercises might help for you. So the first one we're going to do is just a hip internal rotation because we want to be able to bring those knees back in if
},
{
    48.36,51.82
     they're bowed out. A lot of times that's because those internal rotators are weak.
},
{
    51.82,56.76
     So this one is just going to be a reverse clam shell is what a lot of people
},
{
    56.76,60.76
     call it. So you get into that clam shell position which you might have seen in
},
{
    60.76,64.78
     some of my videos where you want to make sure your hips are perpendicular to the
},
{
    64.78,66.6
     floor or the couch or the bed.
},
{
    66.6,69.46
     You don't have to get on the floor to do these, but you don't want to be rolling your
},
{
    69.46,71.38
     hips while you're doing them.
},
{
    71.38,75.86
     The top leg is going to be a little bit different than the normal clamshells because usually
},
{
    75.86,77.36
     you bring your knees apart.
},
{
    77.36,82.16
     This time the knees are going to stay together and you're going to lift that foot up.
},
{
    82.16,86.14
     So see I'm going into that internal rotation of the hip.
},
{
    86.34,91.34
     So these are ones that sometimes it might feel pretty easy.
},
{
    91.34,95.02
     You might not feel like you're doing a whole lot, but if you're doing them correctly
},
{
    95.32,99.94
     and you're not rolling your hips a lot, a lot of times by the time you get to seven or eight
},
{
    99.94,111.52
     you might be feeling it a little bit. And then once they get really easy, you can add a resistive band into it. But just nice, slow and controlled movement, really trying to rotate. You should
},
{
    111.52,115.76
     feel it at the hips. You might feel it at the knee a little bit if you have knee issues.
},
{
    115.76,119.68
     But just starting off maybe with five to ten, kind of working your way up, doing those a couple
},
{
    119.68,126.4
     times a day. So the next one is going to be a side-lying hip adduction. Again, you want
},
{
    126.4,131.52
     to work those inner thigh muscles to help bring those knees in. So this time
},
{
    131.52,135.28
     this is the leg that I'm going to be working. So the one that you want to
},
{
    135.28,139.9
     work on to strengthen is going to be on the floor, but I would recommend working
},
{
    139.9,144.8
     both sides with all these exercises if they're both bowed. But the one that's
},
{
    144.8,149.32
     going to be working is on the floor or the bed. So with your top leg you can
},
{
    149.32,153.84
     either put it in the front or you can put it in the back, whichever one is more
},
{
    153.84,157.24
     comfortable for you. Make sure you're lying down, I'm just holding up my head
},
{
    157.24,160.56
     so I can look at you a little bit easier. But again, same kind of thing. You want
},
{
    160.56,164.66
     your hips to be pretty perpendicular, you don't want them to be rolling, and the
},
{
    164.66,167.92
     leg movement's not going to be very big. So before I do this I want
},
{
    167.92,173.28
     to take my thumbnail really quickly. You can take it along with me if you want. So
},
{
    173.28,177.72
     you can see my legs not going to come up very high. Some people want to try and
},
{
    177.72,182.24
     rotate and bring it up but then you're not quite getting that exercise of those
},
{
    182.24,186.24
     hip adductors, adductors. So it doesn't have to be a big movement.
},
{
    186.24,191.0
     You're just lifting up your leg, trying to keep your toes pointed as you go.
},
{
    191.0,193.28
     So same thing, just start off with a little bit.
},
{
    193.28,196.16
     These are a little harder than they look, even with just a couple.
},
{
    196.16,198.36
     I can already feel those muscles working a little bit.
},
{
    198.36,200.88
     So it doesn't have to be a lot.
},
{
    200.88,209.36
     So the next exercise is going to be for the dorsiflexors because a lot of times if you're rolling out those dorsiflexors the ones that pull up your foot when you
},
{
    209.36,213.6
     walk aren't quite getting what they're they're doing. You can do this seated,
},
{
    213.6,218.2
     you can do this on the floor, on your bed. I like kind of on the floor because
},
{
    218.2,221.8
     you can get a little bit closer. You can do these a couple different ways by
},
{
    221.8,226.36
     anchoring the band somewhere but I like to just kind of hold it like this.
},
{
    226.36,228.76
     And then you're just gonna pull up
},
{
    228.76,230.84
     because then you can change your resistance.
},
{
    230.84,233.48
     So if I want more, if that's too hard,
},
{
    233.48,235.16
     I can stretch that band a little bit.
},
{
    235.16,238.92
     And then I'm just pulling up into that dorsiflexion,
},
{
    238.92,242.12
     getting those anterior tibialis muscles
},
{
    242.12,243.6
     and all those coming up.
},
{
    243.6,246.76
     So just nice and controlled when you're using a band,
},
{
    246.76,248.28
     you don't want it to be wiggling
},
{
    248.28,249.6
     because that might just mean
},
{
    249.6,251.28
     that you're not quite ready for the band
},
{
    251.28,252.8
     and then you can just put your foot out
},
{
    252.8,255.88
     and just do pulls up that way.
},
{
    255.88,257.96
     So again, with the band just starting off
},
{
    257.96,259.84
     with maybe five to 10
},
{
    259.84,261.44
     and then kind of working your way up
},
{
    261.44,263.68
     from there a couple of times a day.
},
{
    264.56,270.08
     So after that, we're gonna go into a glute stretch or figure four stretch, because a lot of
},
{
    270.08,277.36
     times the glutes are tight and so they're pulling those hips outward. So an easy way to stretch those
},
{
    277.36,282.0
     glutes is just to do that figure four where the side you want to stretch. So if I'm stretching
},
{
    282.0,288.08
     this side, I'm crossing it over to the other side. And again, make sure you're relaxing your head. Don't strain your neck while
},
{
    288.08,291.92
     you're doing it. I'm just bringing it out so I can talk to you. And then you're going to grab
},
{
    291.92,298.96
     between the other side and just pull up this way. So I should be feeling that stretch right in
},
{
    298.96,309.2
     through here. So stretching out those external rotators, the glutes and all that kind of stuff. And since this is a full stretch, you're going to hold it for 30 seconds
},
{
    309.2,313.6
     and then do that three times on each side. So I'll show you the other side real quick.
},
{
    313.6,319.2
     So crossing over just right above the knee, grabbing underneath and pulling up towards
},
{
    319.2,323.12
     you until you feel that nice stretch. The stretch should feel comfortable with tension.
},
{
    323.12,329.56
     It shouldn't be painful. And again, holding that for 30 seconds, doing that three times on each side. So the
},
{
    329.56,335.16
     next ones are going to be seated. So in seated, you can also do hip internal strengthening,
},
{
    335.16,341.96
     hip internal rotation strengthening. So when you're seated, if you turn your foot out this
},
{
    341.96,346.48
     way, that's that hip internal rotation. But it's not bringing
},
{
    346.48,352.12
     the leg out. It's rotating here so the knee doesn't really move that much. You
},
{
    352.12,357.88
     should feel it up at the hip. So this is the hip internal rotation strengthening.
},
{
    357.88,362.48
     You can do these without a band, but if they feel pretty easy, if you can get to
},
{
    362.48,365.12
     25, 30 easily, then you might want
},
{
    365.12,370.44
     to try a resistive band. So you can just anchor it with the other side and then same thing,
},
{
    370.44,377.2
     you're just rotating it outwards. So this, I feel it a lot in the hip here. So make sure
},
{
    377.2,380.6
     you start off with the largest band if you're going to try it and then kind of work your
},
{
    380.6,386.64
     way up from there. So then the next one is going to be kind of a figure
},
{
    386.64,391.6
     four stretch seated. So again stretching out the glutes, stretching out those hip external
},
{
    391.6,397.56
     rotators. So it's kind of the same as lying down, except this time when you cross over
},
{
    397.56,400.88
     you're going to be moving your upper body instead of bringing your lower body up to
},
{
    400.88,406.0
     you. So sit up nice and straight, make sure your back is straight, and you're just
},
{
    406.64,411.92
     leaning forward at your hips. So I feel that underneath that booty area on this side, the one
},
{
    411.92,416.64
     that you're bringing over to get that stretch. So it's not curling down, I'm feeling no stretch
},
{
    416.64,421.44
     with that. Keep that back straight and just bend forward at your hips. So since this is again a
},
{
    421.44,426.86
     stretch, you're going to hold that for 30 seconds and then do that three times on each side.
},
{
    426.86,433.08
     So just crossing over kind of right above the knee there and then leaning into it getting that stretch.
},
{
    433.08,437.86
     So again, you want to be comfortable in tension, but you don't want it to be painful.
},
{
    439.38,441.48
     And then so the last one's going to be standing up.
},
{
    441.76,448.64
     So the last one is going to be again working the adductors and the internal rotators. So you can get just a soccer
},
{
    448.64,454.0
     ball, basketball, yoga blocks work really well. Just something that will keep your
},
{
    454.0,459.76
     knees still about a hip width distance apart, maybe a little bit more, a little
},
{
    459.76,463.0
     bit less, but you don't want them to be really close together. So for this one,
},
{
    463.0,468.32
     this is not going to be a squat, it's going to kind of be a hip hinge, but what you want to do is squeeze into the ball. So I'm
},
{
    468.32,473.28
     getting that squeeze, activating these muscles, you know, activating those internal muscles,
},
{
    473.28,479.28
     keeping my back straight and just kind of hinging down like I'm going towards my toes. But keep that
},
{
    479.28,484.24
     squeeze the whole time. That's the hardest part is keeping that squeeze and then going down.
},
{
    484.24,488.36
     You'll feel those hamstrings stretches and then come back up. So just nice
},
{
    488.36,493.84
     continuous slow motion. If you have to reset each time with the squeeze, you can
},
{
    493.84,497.36
     but if you really want to get that good strength thing try and keep that squeeze
},
{
    497.36,502.56
     the whole time when you're going down and coming back up. So there you have it.
},
{
    502.56,507.24
