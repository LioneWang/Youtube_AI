},
{
    15.84,16.68
     on the internet.
},
{
    16.68,17.84
     In our humble opinion, Bob.
},
{
    17.84,20.84
     Today we're gonna talk about must do exercises
},
{
    20.84,22.76
     when you have an injured foot or ankle.
},
{
    22.76,24.36
     If you want faster recovery.
},
{
    24.36,27.36
     Right. This is the critical thing to do because
},
{
    27.36,29.68
     if you don't get at it, you're gonna atrophy.
},
{
    29.68,31.6
     Yeah, the muscles in the hip, the knee,
},
{
    31.6,33.76

{
    73.44,77.46
     We got a 60 second version of our program every day.
},
{
    77.46,79.12
     All right, Brad, what are we doing here?
},
{
    79.12,81.92
     Well, if you've got the ankle, a foot,
},
{
    81.92,84.32
     some injury below the knee
},
{
    84.32,86.8
     and you're unable to walk on it.
},
{
    86.8,88.96
     And oftentimes it might be no weight-bearing.
},
{
    88.96,90.92
     The doctor may say, you know, you have a fracture,
},
{
    90.92,92.24
     you're not gonna be able to walk on it.
},
{
    92.24,94.04
     Or partial weight-bearing or total.
},
{
    94.04,95.76
     And it may be up to four to six weeks.
},
{
    95.76,99.36
     And in that time, particularly the hip,
},
{
    99.36,101.32
     as where I really noticed immediate,
},
{
    101.32,104.0
     almost immediate weakness in the hip abductor,
},
{
    104.0,105.76
     which is a big component
},
{
    105.76,108.42
     of your walking gait and getting back to normal.
},
{
    108.42,110.44
     But we still wanna get the whole leg going.
},
{
    110.44,113.04
     So how are we gonna do that when we got a sore ankle?
},
{
    113.04,115.0
     You can't put weight on it possibly.
},
{
    115.0,117.04
     And we're gonna show you some exercises
},
{
    117.04,118.74
     and it's gonna make a big difference.
},
{
    118.74,120.52
     Plus you get circulation in the leg,
},
{
    120.52,121.88
     which is gonna help the healing time.
},
{
    121.88,123.2
     It's all good, exactly.
},
{
    123.2,126.9
     And I've noticed, I mean, you can actually see the girth.
},
{
    126.9,130.04
     Actually declines rather rapidly.
},
{
    130.04,131.5
     And the definition of the muscles,
},
{
    131.5,133.9
     so like you'll compare one quad to the other,
},
{
    133.9,137.38
     and that quad will be a lot smaller and a lot less defined.
},
{
    137.38,139.74
     Right, so if you don't take care of things.
},
{
    139.74,140.9
     Don't take care of business, right.
},
{
    140.9,141.74
     So should we get to work?
},
{
    141.74,142.58
     Let's go to work.
},
{
    142.58,143.58
     There you go, Bob.
},
{
    143.58,146.16
     All right, so we're gonna start with a hip.
},
{
    146.16,148.44
     Bob's gonna show some exercises
},
{
    148.44,150.4
     you can do for the hip, laying down.
},
{
    150.4,151.4
     You can do it on the floor,
},
{
    151.4,153.8
     carpeted floor preferably in your bed.
},
{
    153.8,156.44
     I'm gonna show you the same muscle groups
},
{
    156.44,159.0
     for the hip in a standing position.
},
{
    159.0,160.8
     Now, with a little resistance too.
},
{
    160.8,162.12
     With some resistance.
},
{
    162.12,165.08
     You could do this without the resistance, but you may start that way, but you're eventually With some resistance. You could do this without the resistance,
},
{
    165.08,167.6
     but you may start that way,
},
{
    167.6,169.2
     but you're eventually gonna need resistance.
},
{
    169.2,171.16
     So I'm gonna use a band,
},
{
    171.16,173.44
     and I've got, when you get these bands,
},
{
    173.44,177.0
     the almost everyone gives you these Velcro straps
},
{
    177.0,178.1
     for your ankle.
},
{
    178.1,181.56
     And then you need something to hook the band up somewhere.
},
{
    181.56,183.84
     We're gonna use the wall anchor here.
},
{
    183.84,186.24
     It works very nicely, okay?
},
{
    186.24,187.58
     And you-
},
{
    187.58,188.94
     We, by the way, invented it.
},
{
    188.94,189.94
     Yes, we did.
},
{
    189.94,190.78
     The wall anchor.
},
{
    190.78,191.62
     Yep.
},
{
    191.62,193.2
     So we'll put a link down below for you.
},
{
    193.2,195.44
     And this is why we, one of the reasons we did,
},
{
    195.44,196.88
     because they work so well.
},
{
    196.88,198.88
     And I'm gonna, you can use something for balance.
},
{
    198.88,200.64
     You can hold onto the wall, a piece of furniture.
},
{
    200.64,202.16
     I'm gonna use the Booyah stick.
},
{
    202.16,203.0
     Are you ready, Bob?
},
{
    203.0,205.16
     So are we doing the first ones together?
},
{
    205.16,207.48
     Yeah, we're gonna do all these same, yeah.
},
{
    207.48,208.72
     Let me go this way first then,
},
{
    208.72,210.2
     because we're gonna do hip flexion first.
},
{
    210.2,213.16
     Right, so you can see Bob's got a nice,
},
{
    213.16,216.84
     so we know which ankle, first foot is injured.
},
{
    216.84,218.2
     And we're gonna do hip flexion.
},
{
    218.2,221.16
     I'll do it standing, Bob's gonna do it supine laying down.
},
{
    221.16,222.0
     Ready?
},
{
    222.0,224.24
     I got the opposite leg up as a brace.
},
{
    224.24,225.34
     The whole brace my back.
},
{
    225.34,227.7
     And we're just gonna go like that.
},
{
    227.7,230.54
     So yeah, you can do it straight knee.
},
{
    230.54,233.14
     If you're doing it here, think about good posture.
},
{
    233.14,235.48
     That's why it's nice to do it laying down too.
},
{
    235.48,238.1
     Cause my back's some good posture when I'm doing this.
},
{
    238.1,240.96
     10 to 15 reps is typically good.
},
{
    240.96,242.94
     The nice thing about doing it standing
},
{
    242.94,245.82
     is you're gonna work your balance as well
},
{
    245.82,246.66
     for your other leg.
},
{
    246.66,248.96
     And I'm getting my opposite leg as well.
},
{
    248.96,250.96
     They're actually a little bit almost core.
},
{
    250.96,253.0
     Yeah, definitely.
},
{
    253.0,254.92
     And you know, you may want to have a pillow.
},
{
    254.92,258.8
     Bob doesn't have a pillow because his head's falling off.
},
{
    258.8,260.48
     Should we go to abduction next?
},
{
    260.48,261.32
     Okay.
},
{
    263.12,264.64
     That's the thing, I gotta keep flipping around
},
{
    264.64,266.72
     in order to get, so you guys can see it okay.
},
{
    266.72,270.12
     So I'm keeping the toe straight forward.
},
{
    270.12,271.36
     I'm not going up like this.
},
{
    271.36,272.2
     Yep, same with me.
},
{
    272.2,273.48
     I'm not gonna go out like this.
},
{
    273.48,275.24
     It's gonna go like that.
},
{
    275.24,276.32
     And are you ready?
},
{
    276.32,278.0
     Yes, I'm ready.
},
{
    278.0,279.64
     You say that now, but what do you really mean?
},
{
    279.64,280.56
     I really mean I'm ready.
},
{
    280.56,281.88
     Okay then.
},
{
    281.88,284.24
     And I can even put my hand on my hips
},
{
    284.24,286.6
     to feel the muscles kicking in.
},
{
    286.6,290.24
     And this one is probably the most important out of all of them
},
{
    290.24,291.28
     but they're all important.
},
{
    291.28,292.34
     But this one is.
},
{
    292.34,294.68
     This one really provides a lot of stability to you
},
{
    294.68,296.96
     when you're walking as Brad had mentioned earlier.
},
{
    296.96,299.26
     10 to 15 as well.
},
{
    299.26,301.52
     The nice thing about doing this with a band,
},
{
    301.52,304.12
     if it gets too easy, simply take a step farther away.
},
{
    304.12,305.98
     Whoa, that makes a difference,
},
{
    305.98,308.22
     just about four inches farther away.
},
{
    308.22,309.06
     I'm gonna go back.
},
{
    309.06,312.38
     Okay, now we wanna do extension.
},
{
    315.78,320.22
     So now we face the wall, Bob's on his stomach or prone.
},
{
    320.22,321.06
     Are you ready Bob?
},
{
    321.06,321.9
     Oh, I'm ready.
},
{
    321.9,322.74
     Oh, good posture.
},
{
    322.74,324.3
     Now when you're standing,
},
{
    324.3,326.84
     you really have to make sure you don't do this
},
{
    326.84,327.76
     with any of these.
},
{
    327.76,330.48
     You wanna keep that shoulders and trunk up
},
{
    330.48,334.52
     straight and steady while the hip does the work.
},
{
    334.52,336.84
     If this is too hard for you to do it straight,
},
{
    336.84,339.36
     you could start off like this.
},
{
    339.36,343.04
     But you're isolating the buttock.
},
{
    343.04,345.24
     Yeah, getting the hamstring out of a little bit.
},
{
    345.24,347.16
     You could actually do it this way too.
},
{
    347.16,348.0
     Sure, yeah.
},
{
    348.0,349.92
     Yeah, good idea Bob.
},
{
    349.92,352.32
     Oh, you can feel those hamstrings working
},
{
    352.32,357.32
     because the weight of this cam walker is north of the foot.
},
{
    357.68,358.92
     Yeah.
},
{
    358.92,361.2
     And finally, but not leasely,
},
{
    361.2,363.4
     we're gonna do the hip AD doctors,
},
{
    363.4,366.12
     add doctors, the groin muscles.
},
{
    366.12,368.08
     Leasely, is that a word?
},
{
    368.08,369.64
     Well, I don't know if someone was hollerin'
},
{
    369.64,370.48
     because I said height.
},
{
    370.48,371.82
     Height, right.
},
{
    371.82,374.36
     The comments again, so I commented back,
},
{
    374.36,375.56
     I said I'm workin' on it.
},
{
    375.56,377.2
     Oh.
},
{
    377.2,379.68
     So here we go, kind of a cross kick
},
{
    379.68,380.96
     like you're doin' soccer.
},
{
    380.96,382.56
     Right, yep, so I'm goin' like,
},
{
    382.56,384.48
     right, yeah, that's a good,
},
{
    384.48,386.8
     you know, I probably could have been a football player
},
{
    386.8,388.12
     kicking field goals.
},
{
    388.12,388.96
     Think so?
},
{
    388.96,389.8
     Well, I don't know.
},
{
    389.8,391.52
     I thought about it once.
},
{
    391.52,393.0
     You were a wrestler, right?
},
{
    393.0,394.0
     Right, yeah.
},
{
    394.0,396.0
     But I wasn't that good, but yeah.
},
{
    398.16,399.36
     I probably didn't do enough of these.
},
{
    399.36,402.88
     Okay, now we want to work the knee and the hamstrings.
},
{
    402.88,404.04
     Okay.
},
{
    404.04,406.04
     Now this is a hard one to do
},
{
    407.2,409.72
     when you got an injury, especially for no weight bearing
},
{
    409.72,411.6
     or very little weight bearing.
},
{
    411.6,413.92
     And what we've, there's a couple options,
},
{
    413.92,417.36
     but really the best thing is to do this,
},
{
    417.36,420.96
     get yourself a strap and do it with the band.
},
{
    420.96,423.88
     And you're gonna do it seated, work in quadriceps here,
},
{
    423.88,426.12
     and we're gonna kick it out straight
},
{
    426.12,427.7
     and you can bring it down slow.
},
{
    427.7,430.7
     Now this is one of those things where you don't wanna do this.
},
{
    430.7,434.36
     You really wanna work on good control,
},
{
    434.36,437.4
     especially going back down, slow it down.
},
{
    437.4,438.84
     So that's eccentric strengthening
},
{
    438.84,443.2
     and you're adding to the overall strength of the knee
},
{
    443.2,445.76
     and you're getting strengthening both directions that way too.
},
{
    445.76,446.6
     Exactly.
},
{
    446.6,449.22
     Again, 10 to 15 of those.
},
{
    449.22,450.68
     We're gonna turn the chair around.
},
{
    450.68,452.28
     By the way, that's why these,
},
{
    452.28,453.92
     using the wall anchor and the strut
},
{
    453.92,456.12
     and the exercise bands is actually better
},
{
    456.12,457.52
     than one of those machines, Brad,
},
{
    457.52,460.24
     because when one of those machines you go up
},
{
    460.24,462.12
     and then actually the weight pushes you down.
},
{
    462.12,462.96
     Right.
},
{
    462.96,465.16
     So you're not getting the resistance on the way down.
},
{
    465.16,466.68
     I guess if you go slow, you would.
},
{
    466.68,468.96
     Yeah, but this does work nice.
},
{
    468.96,471.28
     I mean, cause you don't have to have a machine at home.
},
{
    471.28,472.28
     Right.
},
{
    472.28,475.36
     So pulling in and let it out.
},
{
    475.36,477.8
     Now you do have to be careful about hamstring cramps.
},
{
    477.8,479.76
     Some people may cramp up, so you know,
},
{
    479.76,481.44
     just don't pull in really far.
},
{
    481.44,483.04
     Exactly, if you go way underneath.
},
{
    483.04,483.88
     Yeah.
},
{
    483.88,486.48
     You're gonna, it's pretty easy to cramp up that hamstring.
},
{
    486.48,487.56
     There you go.
},
{
    487.56,491.24
     So 10 to 15 of those, and you're done.
},
{
    491.24,493.82
     Make sure you do that every day.
},
{
    493.82,496.0
     And the last thing is,
},
{
    496.0,499.48
     if the doctor says you can do range of motion
},
{
    499.48,501.12
     on your ankle or your foot,
},
{
    501.12,503.84
     but it's still no weight bearing, which is common,
},
{
    503.84,504.68
     then you can do it.
},
{
    504.68,506.84
     You're gonna do it in a pain-free range.
},
{
    506.84,509.52
     And we like to do the ABCs.
},
{
    509.52,510.36
     Right.
},
{
    510.36,512.92
     So Brad mentions that if you took a piece of chalk
},
{
    512.92,516.84
     and or a marker and taped it to your big toe,
},
{
    516.84,518.48
     and then had a board right in front of you,
},
{
    518.48,520.6
     you're gonna actually do the alphabet
},
{
    520.6,522.92
     by doing capital letters.
},
{
    522.92,525.56
     And you're gonna trace them out using that marker.
},
{
    526.96,529.56
     I'm not saying you should physically tape a piece
},
{
    529.56,530.92
     of talk on there and get it.
},
{
    530.92,532.84
     I mean, you could, but just use your imagination.
},
{
    532.84,533.68
     Right.
},
{
    533.68,535.32
     Let's borrow your imagination.
},
{
    535.32,536.72
     That's what my teacher used to say.
},
{
    536.72,537.56
     Oh, really?
},
{
    537.56,538.4
     I borrowed your imagination.
},
{
    538.4,539.44
     What grade was that?
},
{
    539.44,540.28
     Eighth grade?
},
{
    540.28,543.6
     I hate to tell you, but it was when I was a physical therapist.
},
{
    543.6,544.6
     Oh, wow.
},
{
    544.6,546.4
     I don't know why you would do that.
},
{
    546.4,548.08
     Borrow your imagination.
},
{
    548.08,550.24
     Now, if you are in a cam walker like this,
},
{
    550.24,552.88
     it's nice to get it off and it is nice to get it moving.
},
{
    552.88,555.28
     You're gonna do it within pain-free range.
},
{
    555.28,556.96
     Of course, I could have mentioned, do the ABC.
},
{
    556.96,558.48
     You might start with small letters
},
{
    558.48,559.96
     and work up the capital letters
},
{
    559.96,561.88
     so you get more motion.
},
{
    561.88,563.48
     Wow, that was nice Bob.
},
{
    563.48,565.72
     You actually do feel that when you need to work out.
},
{
    565.72,568.7
     Absolutely, so very good, good luck with your ankle
},
{
    568.7,571.72
     and foot rehab and you'll get back to straight walking
},
{
    571.72,574.96
     and get strong like bulls, strong like bulls.
},
{
    574.96,575.8
     Thank you.
},
{
    575.8,None
     Thanks for watching. you
},
