     A sudden onset of neck pain or stiffness is actually quite common.
},
{
    3.56,7.64
     In fact, two out of three of us will suffer from it at some point in our lifetime.
},
{
    7.64,11.04
     Now I know it's a pain but the good news is that neck pain usually lasts a couple of
},
{
    11.04,15.2
     weeks and there are also many things that you can do at home to help with this.
},
{
    15.2,17.08
     So what we're waiting for, let's begin.
},
{
    17.08,23.24
     Okay, so in most cases neck pain is not usually due to a serious condition or a neck problem.
},
{
    23.24,25.28
     In most cases, quite often, the cause is
},
{
    25.28,28.56
     actually unknown and we call this non-specific neck pain.
},
{
    28.56,34.2
     Now, it might be caused by bad posture, sleeping awkwardly, a pinched nerve, a neck injury
},
{
    34.2,36.36
     and potentially many other reasons too.
},
{
    36.36,39.76
     However, please remember, if your neck pain or neck stiffness doesn't go away after a
},
{
    39.76,44.08
     few weeks, painkillers haven't helped it or you're just worried about it, or if you
},
{
    44.08,48.96
     have any of the following symptoms like tingling, prickling, numbness sensation, or if your arm has gone
},
{
    48.96,53.12
     cold or your arm and hands have become weak, then you need to speak to your doctor as soon
},
{
    53.12,57.04
     as possible and we'll leave a full list in the description below for you as well.
},
{
    57.04,59.48
     So how can you ease the neck pain or stiffness yourself?
},
{
    59.48,63.8
     Well the first thing that you should do is try either a heat or a cold pack on the area
},
{
    63.8,65.4
     of the neck that hurts. So option one, get a hot water bottle, wrap it in a heat or a cold pack on the area of the neck that hurts.
},
{
    65.4,69.32
     So option one, get a hot water bottle, wrap it in a tea towel, and place it on the area
},
{
    69.32,73.32
     that hurts for about 20 minutes 2 to 3 times a day.
},
{
    73.32,75.8
     Please be very careful though that you don't burn yourself.
},
{
    75.8,79.8
     Or option two, grab yourself a pack of frozen vegetables like frozen peas, and before anyone
},
{
    79.8,84.12
     comments I know that peas aren't technically vegetables but we do refer to them as vegetables.
},
{
    84.12,88.96
     So grab yourself a pack of frozen peas, wrap it a tea towel and place it on the area for about five minutes
},
{
    89.12,93.08
     Two to three times a day. It's really important that you do wrap it in a tea towel, please
},
{
    93.08,95.72
     So that's a few simple things that you can do that are gonna help
},
{
    95.72,98.68
     But the next thing that I recommend to all patients are these four
},
{
    98.88,102.52
     Simple exercises that everyone can do at home and I know what you're thinking right now
},
{
    102.52,106.92
     You're probably thinking about Abraham. You must be joking, my neck is so painful instead, I can barely
},
{
    106.92,110.84
     move it and I get that, I've been there but please remember, bed rest for more than a
},
{
    110.84,114.88
     couple of days is going to make it harder for you to get back to your normal routine
},
{
    114.88,118.0
     and by doing these exercises it's going to help with the pain, it's going to help you
},
{
    118.0,120.12
     recover, so what are we waiting for?
},
{
    120.12,123.28
     Okay, so let's begin with the neck tilt exercise.
},
{
    123.28,126.32
     So tilt your head down and rest your chin on your chest.
},
{
    126.32,128.34
     Now gently tense your neck muscles
},
{
    128.34,130.4
     and hold this for five seconds.
},
{
    130.4,132.76
     Then return back to your neutral position.
},
{
    132.76,135.48
     You need to try and repeat this five times.
},
{
    138.78,141.2
     Next up, we have the side to side neck tilt.
},
{
    141.2,143.6
     So tilt your head down towards your shoulder
},
{
    143.6,144.7
     leading with your ear.
},
{
    144.7,148.72
     Now gently tense your neck muscles and hold this for five seconds, then return your
},
{
    148.72,154.4
     head to the center and repeat on the opposite side. Repeat this five times on each side.
},
{
    154.4,162.56
     We're now past the halfway mark, so next up we have neck turns. In this exercise, turn
},
{
    162.56,165.04
     your head towards one side side keeping your chin at the
},
{
    165.04,170.32
     same height and moving within comfortable limits. Now gently tense your neck muscles and hold for
},
{
    170.32,175.52
     five seconds then return your head to the center and repeat on the opposite side. Once again you
},
{
    175.52,184.4
     need to try and repeat this five times on each side. And lastly we have the neck stretch so
},
{
    184.4,189.26
     keeping the rest of the body straight push your chin forward so your throat is stretched.
},
{
    189.26,193.0
     Now gently tense your neck muscles and hold for five seconds.
},
{
    193.0,197.7
     Then return your head to the centre and push it backwards, keeping your chin up.
},
{
    197.7,200.36
     You also need to hold this for five seconds.
},
{
    200.36,202.84
     Repeat this exercise five times.
},
{
    202.84,206.88
     So as I mentioned at the start of the video, most cases of neck pain the cause is unclear
},
{
    206.88,209.2
     and we call that non-specific neck pain.
},
{
    209.2,213.76
     So for non-specific neck pain, these exercises should help ease the pain within two weeks
},
{
    213.76,217.12
     and hopefully after four to six weeks, you should be fully recovered.
},
{
    217.12,221.56
     Now please remember, try and do these exercises for six to eight weeks in total and this will
},
{
    221.56,225.64
     help to strengthen the area too and hopefully prevent the neck pain from coming back.
},
{
    225.64,229.24
     Now please remember that if your symptoms aren't improving then you should definitely
},
{
    229.24,231.24
     make an appointment to speak to your healthcare professional.
},
{
    231.24,234.24
     I explained it right at the start of the video and I'll say it again.
},
{
    234.24,237.72
     I'll leave a full list in the description below on when you should speak to your healthcare
},
{
    237.72,240.64
     professional and I'd highly recommend everyone read it.
},
{
    240.64,244.2
     So your next question might be well Abraham what other options do we have for neck pain
},
{
    244.2,245.24
     or neck stiffness?
},
{
    245.24,247.32
     Well, another option would be painkillers.
},
{
    247.32,252.24
     These are quite effective for the neck pain or stiffness, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen.
},
{
    252.24,256.06
     But please always speak to your pharmacist first before you take any medication so they
},
{
    256.06,259.28
     can check that it's safe and suitable to use that medication.
},
{
    259.28,263.0
     And also, always read the medication leaflet that comes with any medicine.
},
{
    263.0,267.62
     Another useful tip is to use a low firm pillow, as quite often larger pillows can cause neck
},
{
    267.62,268.62
     pain and stiffness.
},
{
    268.62,272.3
     Also, please remember, if you don't have full movement of your neck because of the pain
},
{
    272.3,275.46
     or the stiffness, don't do activities where you need full movement.
},
{
    275.46,279.5
     For example, driving or cycling, as you're putting yourself at risk and you're putting
},
{
    279.5,280.74
     other people at risk.
},
{
    280.74,283.46
     So that's a little about treatments, but what about prevention?
},
{
    283.46,286.36
     How can you try and prevent non-specific neck pain from coming back?
},
{
    286.36,289.8
     Let's quickly run through them as I think it'd be quite useful for everyone to learn.
},
{
    289.8,293.0
     So tip number one, when you sit, always try and sit upright.
},
{
    293.0,296.44
     And I know it sounds a bit strange, but next time you sit down, just think to yourself,
},
{
    296.44,297.44
     how are you sat?
},
{
    297.44,298.44
     How are your shoulders placed?
},
{
    298.44,300.2
     So they roll back, and they roll forward.
},
{
    300.2,301.44
     And how is your neck placed?
},
{
    301.44,305.78
     Because all of these, the posture, can make a massive difference on neck pain.
},
{
    305.78,308.12
     And tip number two, do you have a desk job?
},
{
    308.12,309.12
     Are you sitting correctly?
},
{
    309.12,310.56
     Is your monitor the right height?
},
{
    310.56,311.84
     Is your seat the right height?
},
{
    311.84,313.76
     Because all of these can make a massive difference.
},
{
    313.76,317.68
     Now the good news is the NHS have a really useful article all about how to set up your
},
{
    317.68,321.72
     desk properly, all about how to sit properly, which I mentioned tip number one.
},
{
    321.72,324.04
     So if this applies to you, please check out that article.
},
{
    324.04,328.0
     I will leave a link to it in the description below. And also before anyone comments and says
},
{
    328.0,332.0
     this monitor is too low for you. I promise you it's not. This is a wide angle lens and for some
},
{
    332.0,336.08
     strange reason this monitor looks like it's too low for me, but it is the correct height.
},
{
    336.08,341.12
     Which moves us on nicely to tip number three. Make sure your head is the same height as your body
},
{
    341.12,345.84
     when you're sleeping. So remember the low pillow that we spoke about earlier, this can really help.
},
{
    345.84,348.32
     Also, make sure you have a firm mattress.
},
{
    348.32,350.04
     This has been shown to help as well.
},
{
    350.04,352.02
     Make sure you don't sleep on your front.
},
{
    352.02,353.0
     This doesn't help.
},
{
    353.0,355.12
     And lastly, make sure you don't twist your neck
},
{
    355.12,355.96
     when you're in bed.
},
{
    355.96,357.44
     This is a habit that a lot of people do,
},
{
    357.44,358.6
     but it's really not good.
},
{
    358.6,360.12
