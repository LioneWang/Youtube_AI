     and migraines. In this video I'll be showing you some techniques to help you

    15.8,21.8
     with your headaches and migraines. Suboxyput massage. To massage the suboxyput
},
{
    21.8,25.68
     muscles run your thumbs or fingers just under the base of the skull.
},
{
    26.64,33.52
     You'll be able to find a slight crevice under the skull where it finishes and it meets the cervical
},
{
    33.52,40.16
     spine. When you add some pressure in this area, it feels slightly tender and you may experience
},
{
    40.16,45.8
     some pain relief. Start by using the pads of your fingertips to press into the
},
{
    45.8,50.86
     muscle belly of the muscle of the back of the neck just under your skull. Working
},
{
    50.86,54.48
     on the muscle fibers from the side of the neck and then back into the middle of
},
{
    54.48,59.0
     the back of the neck again. Try not to go past and in front of the side of the
},
{
    59.0,63.04
     neck. This is where the main attachments of the muscles of the neck
},
{
    63.04,65.36
     attaches to the skull.
},
{
    69.92,70.88
     The main one we will be working on that causes the most problems is the suboxyput muscles.
},
{
    77.92,78.96
     Do this for two minutes, have one minute rest and repeat the process again for four to six sets.
},
{
    82.64,85.4
     If you feel like there is more tenderness on the rear sides of the neck, just spend more time in this area. These
},
{
    85.4,92.78
     muscles are from your shoulders, such as levator scapula, cervicals, perispinal and upper trapezius
},
{
    92.78,97.8
     muscles that attach into these areas. To add more pressure on the suboxibut muscles or
},
{
    97.8,102.28
     be more precise, you can use the points of your thumbs instead. This way you can create
},
{
    102.28,109.16
     more pressure on the trigger points and maybe causing referral pain to the head and back into the eyes.
},
{
    109.16,115.08
     Spend about 6 seconds on each trigger point and return to each one 4 to 6 times. Take
},
{
    115.08,119.56
     your time and try not to bruise yourself. We tend to get headaches and migraines like
},
{
    119.56,123.38
     symptoms from the muscles behind the neck due to the nerves that travel through the
},
{
    123.38,129.0
     posterior neck muscles and up to the base of the skull or around the side of the head and into the ear.
},
{
    129.0,140.0
     These nerves consist of the occipital nerves, the grady auricular nerves and some of the branches of the trigeminal nerves that comes off from the circles spine and into the face.

     Massage tools

{
    142.0,146.4
     A common massage tool at home that most people have access to is the foam roller.
},
{
    147.92,154.16
     I highly recommend using one that has foam knobs on it, as they are able to replicate the thumbs
},
{
    154.16,158.8
     that are pressing into the muscles in the back of the neck. Lay down on the floor and place the
},
{
    158.8,166.0
     foam roller on the back of the neck at the base of the skull. Allow the knobs of the foam roller to press into the
},
{
    166.0,170.96
     tender area of the muscles or the trigger point. This is where the majority of the posterior
},
{
    170.96,175.72
     neck muscles attach to the base of the skull and upper neck. These muscles can refer pain
},
{
    175.72,181.72
     locally to the face and the back of the head or behind the eye. Turn your head slightly
},
{
    181.72,190.2
     to the side of the muscle that you want to work on and rock yourself slightly left to right, allowing the foam roller to do its work on the muscle.
},
{
    190.2,193.62
     Try not to use your strength to press into the foam roller.
},
{
    193.62,197.7
     You only need the weight of your head to do most of the work for you.
},
{
    197.7,202.88
     Work on the muscle for 20 seconds on each area, move on to the next and return to the
},
{
    202.88,208.08
     same spot 4-6 times. Do this on both sides.
},
{
    208.08,214.24
     You should have at least 1-3 areas of the neck to roll on. Don't be afraid to move the foam
},
{
    214.24,220.0
     roller slightly lower to work on the posterior paraspinal muscles of the neck. The lacrosse
},
{
    220.0,227.94
     ball is a great compact tool that will allow you to be more precise on working on the muscles in the back of the neck and base of the skull.
},
{
    227.94,232.88
     Lay on the floor and carefully rest the back of your head where the muscle is on the lacrosse
},
{
    232.88,233.88
     ball.
},
{
    233.88,238.12
     It will be easier to access the muscle by slightly turning to the side of the muscle
},
{
    238.12,242.76
     that you would like to work on, and with your chin slightly pulled back and tucked in.
},
{
    242.76,245.04
     Allow the weight of your head to rest on the lacrosse
},
{
    245.04,250.48
     ball and move your head slightly left to right, so that the lacrosse ball does some passes of the
},
{
    250.48,257.12
     muscles behind the neck. Do 20 strokes of the muscle belly. Repeat this on both sides four to
},
{
    257.12,264.0
     six times. Peanut massage rollers are one of my favorite tools to use because you can use it
},
{
    264.0,270.0
     throughout the whole spine. They have a gap in the middle so that the spine can pass through which prevents
},
{
    270.0,275.08
     unnecessary pressure on the bony prominences of the spine. To use the peanut tool you can
},
{
    275.08,279.48
     rest your head on it like you're resting your head on a pillow and allow yourself to
},
{
    279.48,283.44
     find a tender spot where the peanut roller is pressing into the muscle of the back of
},
{
    283.44,288.4
     the neck. Then slightly lean over and turn your head slightly to add more pressure
},
{
    288.4,299.0
     onto this area. Rock over the tender area 20 times. Do this 4 to 6 times on each side.
},
{
    299.0,303.06
     The peanut roller is great to allow you to easily access the back of the neck muscles
},
{
    303.06,308.88
     that run from the base of the skull down to the shoulders, whilst allowing room for the bone impromptuances
},
{
    308.88,312.76
     of the spine to run down the gap of the peanut.
},
{
    312.76,317.04
     Try doing this by moving this peanut down to the neck to work on the muscles in the
},
{
    317.04,321.68
     mid neck and at the base of the neck that meets the shoulders.

     A research paper was released in 2006 on massaged participants showed to have greater improvements

     in migraine frequency and sleep quality during the intervention weeks. During the time the
},
{
    337.6,343.2
     research was conducted, the intervention patients reported back with reduced stress, anxiety, heart
