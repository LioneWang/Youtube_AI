     Hi, Captain Wayne Bennett here with another life saving tip that could make you your family's
},
{
    8.82,9.82
     hero.
},
{
    9.82,11.56
     Life cannot exist without breathing.
},
{
    11.56,15.88
     That's why choking is so deadly, causing over 49 deaths per year.
},
{
    15.88,20.96
     It has become the fourth leading cause of death for children under 4 years old.
},
{
    20.96,23.84
     This is a skill that every parent and grandparent should know.
},
{
    23.84,28.76
     It's so simple, yet most people do it wrong. So let's teach you the right way to save someone
},
{
    28.76,36.12
     with a simple rescue technique called the Heimlich Maneuver. So let's begin. If
},
{
    36.12,39.68
     your victim is talking, they are breathing. If the victim is coughing, then
},
{
    39.68,43.56
     have them continue to cough, declare the object, do not strike them on the back.
},
{
    43.56,49.98
     This could cause a partial obstruction to move and cause a complete obstruction. If they can't cough,
},
{
    49.98,55.12
     talk, or breathe, then you need to take immediate action. First, ask them if they're choking
},
{
    55.12,59.88
     and then tell them you're going to perform abdominal thrust to help them breathe. So
},
{
    59.88,64.92
     quickly get behind your victim, placing your leg in between theirs. This gives you more
},
{
    64.92,66.48
     power and better control.
},
{
    66.48,70.04
     Then reach around the stomach, find the belly button with one finger.
},
{
    70.04,73.0
     This is your landmark for the diaphragm, their breathing muscle.
},
{
    73.0,77.76
     Then make a fist with the other hand, place the thumb side just against their stomach,
},
{
    77.76,79.36
     just above your finger.
},
{
    79.36,83.2
     This will keep you just below the rib cage to avoid injuring the victim.
},
{
    83.2,88.76
     Then grab your fist with the other hand and begin forcibly thrusting inward and upward repeatedly
},
{
    88.76,90.52
     until the victim coughs up the object
},
{
    90.52,92.54
     or becomes unresponsive.
},
{
    92.54,94.04
     If they become unresponsive,
},
{
    94.04,96.62
     you will help them to the floor and begin chest thrust.
},
{
    96.62,97.88
     After 30 chest thrusts,
},
{
    97.88,101.04
     which is very similar to the CPR chest compression,
},
{
    101.04,103.96
     you will then perform a head tilt chin lift maneuver,
},
{
    103.96,109.76
     look in the mouth and remove any objects. If they begin breathing, roll them onto the left side into the recovery
},
{
    109.76,133.56
     position. For infants, the technique is completely different.
},
{
    133.56,137.0
     You will hold the baby by supporting the head with one hand in arm.
},
{
    137.0,141.24
     You will give five back slaps between the baby shoulder blades with the heel of the hand.
},
{
    141.24,145.24
     If the object does not come up, then roll the baby face up, place
},
{
    145.24,149.84
     two fingers, one finger below mid nipple line, and deliver five chests for us at about one
},
{
    149.84,154.56
     per second and about one and a half inches deep. You will continue these cycles until
},
{
    154.56,160.24
     the object is expelled or the infant becomes unresponsive. If the infant becomes unresponsive,
},
{
    160.24,167.08
     you will begin infant CPR. Watch for more life-saving videos covering everything from CPR to survival.
},
{
    167.08,None
     And again, thanks for watching and please share this video with family and friends. I'm going to use the same technique as the other one. you
