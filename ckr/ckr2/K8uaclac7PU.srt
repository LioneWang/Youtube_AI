     In this video, I'm going to show you how to relieve a bulging disc in your neck at home.
},
{
    5.4,6.4
     Stay tuned.
},
{
    6.4,7.4
     Hey, everyone.
},
{
    7.4,14.6
     Dr. Rowe from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan.
},
{
    14.6,19.36
     So let's go over some very easy disc bulge stretches and exercises that are really going
},
{
    19.36,24.0
     to target neck pain, possibly shoulder pain or even radiating pain going down into the
},
{
    24.0,25.62
     arms or hands.
},
{
    25.62,28.0
     This is really going to help a pinched nerve in the neck.
},
{
    28.0,31.44
     We're going to do pulling motions, known as traction.
},
{
    31.44,35.06
     When it comes to a disc bulge, there's a lot of compression and what we need to do is pull
},
{
    35.06,37.64
     on that to help relieve pressure in there.
},
{
    37.64,39.7
     All of these exercises can be done at home.
},
{
    39.7,41.3
     They're very safe and effective.
},
{
    41.3,48.52
     The two exercises at the end I'm going to be using what is known as a pull-up band. If you don't have one I'll leave a link in this video's
},
{
    48.52,53.92
     description for this exact band right here. But most of these exercises you do
},
{
    53.92,57.68
     not need any special equipment and you may find that these will give very quick
},
{
    57.68,61.32
     relief possibly even as little as 30 seconds. So let's get started with it and
},
{
    61.32,67.48
     get rid of that disbulge in the neck right now. We're gonna go over different ways on how to traction
},
{
    67.48,70.44
     your neck to relieve pressure into that disbolge.
},
{
    70.44,72.68
     So make sure to go over all of them
},
{
    72.68,74.24
     and go with the one that gives you
},
{
    74.24,75.78
     the most amount of relief.
},
{
    75.78,77.92
     This first one is going to be a basic way
},
{
    77.92,79.96
     to open up those joint spaces
},
{
    79.96,82.32
     and relieve pressure into the neck.
},
{
    82.32,84.16
     It doesn't require any special equipment
},
{
    84.16,85.94
     and it's great for desk workers.
},
{
    85.94,90.24
     What I'm going to do is I'm going to take this portion of the palm, the real meaty portion,
},
{
    90.24,93.9
     and I'm going to place this right on the back of the skull.
},
{
    93.9,97.32
     So right here, go right towards the base of the skull and just kind of feel in there.
},
{
    97.32,100.24
     You'll find two big bumps kind of close to the ears.
},
{
    100.24,104.32
     So I'm going to take my hand, I'm going to place it like this, almost like cupping the
},
{
    104.32,105.04
     back. And then I'm going to bend my hand, I'm going to place it like this, almost like cupping the back.
},
{
    105.04,110.64
     And then I'm going to bend my elbows up like this. What we want to do is with very good upright
},
{
    110.64,118.0
     posture, we want to keep the chin tucked just a little bit. And I'm going to pull up like this
},
{
    118.0,127.92
     with both hands. So when I do this, when I start to pull up towards the ceiling, you're going to feel a very good traction being built
},
{
    127.92,129.68
     into the neck itself.
},
{
    129.68,131.88
     Only go to your comfort level.
},
{
    131.88,134.76
     If you can hold this for 10 to 15 seconds,
},
{
    134.76,137.0
     that is a great starting point.
},
{
    137.0,140.12
     If you can hold it for longer, up to 30, do it.
},
{
    140.12,141.8
     But with this one right here, you just
},
{
    141.8,143.4
     want to take a little bit of a breather,
},
{
    143.4,145.2
     and then you're going to repeat. On the next one, want to take a little bit of a breather and then you're going to repeat.
},
{
    145.2,149.68
     On the next one, try to go a little bit further with it and try to traction those discs out
},
{
    149.68,154.32
     just a little bit further and hopefully you will get a little bit more relief.
},
{
    154.32,157.0
     You want to do this three to five times.
},
{
    157.0,161.04
     And how you know traction is working for you, if you have a pinched nerve, it tends to cause
},
{
    161.04,163.2
     radiating pain downwards.
},
{
    163.2,167.44
     If you're doing this and that pain is starting to come back up to the neck, the starting
},
{
    167.44,171.08
     point where that disc bulges at, you know that is working for you.
},
{
    171.08,173.16
     Again, that's called centralization.
},
{
    173.16,177.48
     So let's take that first exercise to the next level by using our lower body weight to do
},
{
    177.48,178.96
     all the work for us.
},
{
    178.96,181.42
     We're going to use a flat surface such as a desk.
},
{
    181.42,184.48
     You can use a countertop at home, possibly even a sturdy chair.
},
{
    184.48,185.92
     We're also going to start off on the knees,
},
{
    185.92,187.68
     so make sure to put something underneath them
},
{
    187.68,190.08
     for comfort, like a pillow or a towel.
},
{
    190.08,191.76
     So let's go to that flat surface.
},
{
    191.76,194.2
     I'm going to bend the elbow like this,
},
{
    194.2,195.68
     take the backside of the arm,
},
{
    195.68,199.88
     and just place them up on the desk, just like this.
},
{
    199.88,202.72
     We're going to try to create an anchor point.
},
{
    202.72,204.4
     So what I'm going to do next
},
{
    204.4,205.0
     is take the
},
{
    205.0,208.88
     midi portion of the palm, place them over those bumps at the base of the skull
},
{
    208.88,212.8
     right here, and instead of pulling upwards with it, I'm just going to resist
},
{
    212.8,217.44
     this next motion. Let's tuck the chin very slightly again, and I'm just going
},
{
    217.44,223.92
     to start to lower my butt down towards my heels. The more that you go down, the
},
{
    223.92,225.16
     more traction you're going
},
{
    225.16,230.64
     to feel into the neck. Only go to your comfort level. Once you hit that point,
},
{
    230.64,235.48
     hold this for 15 to 30 seconds. You're just going to relax, take a bit of a
},
{
    235.48,241.24
     breather, and then repeat this up to five times. Again, going just a little bit
},
{
    241.24,245.82
     further with it each time to get that extra traction to hopefully
},
{
    245.82,250.34
     relieve pressure into that bulging disc and give you more relief.
},
{
    250.34,255.26
     For this next neck-disk bulge exercise, I'm going to be using an everyday hand-drying
},
{
    255.26,256.26
     towel.
},
{
    256.26,259.92
     Let's roll it up and just place it at the back of the head, right over the base of the
},
{
    259.92,260.92
     skull.
},
{
    260.92,265.8
     Let's take the two ends and pull it forward so there is a lot of tension already being
},
{
    265.8,266.8
     built.
},
{
    266.8,271.72
     From there, slightly tuck the chin and then start to lift upwards on the two ends just
},
{
    271.72,273.52
     like this towards the ceiling.
},
{
    273.52,277.4
     It should feel like it's hooking or grabbing at the base of the skull.
},
{
    277.4,281.4
     When you get to a point where it feels like a very good stretch, you want to hold this
},
{
    281.4,283.68
     one for about 15 to 30 seconds.
},
{
    283.68,289.28
     You're just going to relax and then you're going to repeat this up to three to five times,
},
{
    289.28,291.96
     trying to go a little bit further each time.
},
{
    291.96,294.88
     So let's say that you're having a lot of issues on one side.
},
{
    294.88,296.68
     Let's say the right side for this matter.
},
{
    296.68,299.52
     This is how we can target this just a little bit more.
},
{
    299.52,304.36
     I'm going to crisscross my arms like this, grab the hands right here.
},
{
    304.36,306.84
     Whatever is the opposite side, so in this case
},
{
    306.84,309.14
     it would be my right arm grabbing the left end,
},
{
    309.14,310.84
     this is going to be held stationary,
},
{
    310.84,312.48
     this is going to be our anchor.
},
{
    312.48,314.8
     We're going to take the end on the side
},
{
    314.8,317.14
     that we're focusing on and pull it up like this
},
{
    317.14,319.76
     at a 45 degree angle, it's almost like driving
},
{
    319.76,321.7
     through my eye right here.
},
{
    321.7,326.36
     So I'm going to lift up with this end 45 degrees towards the
},
{
    326.36,330.94
     ceiling while this one just remains stationary. So you'll see kind of how I'm
},
{
    330.94,335.8
     doing this right here. This is going to help open up that particular side just a
},
{
    335.8,340.7
     little bit more. Hold this comfortably for 15 to 30 seconds. You're just going to
},
{
    340.7,345.2
     relax and then you're going to repeat this up to three to five times.
},
{
    345.2,349.88
     Again, if you feel the symptoms on that particular side are starting to come back up towards
},
{
    349.88,354.08
     the neck, you know it's helping to relieve pressure on that bulging disc.
},
{
    354.08,359.24
     So for this next one, let's use gravity to our aid to get a nice traction into the neck.
},
{
    359.24,360.76
     I'm going to be using the towel.
},
{
    360.76,363.54
     I'm going to place it at the back of the head.
},
{
    363.54,366.32
     Let's try to take the two ends and pull forward just a little bit.
},
{
    366.32,370.44
     You want to position yourself to the point where the back of the arms right here are
},
{
    370.44,372.5
     flush against the back of the bed.
},
{
    372.5,377.92
     That creates a stable anchor point because you're going to drive forward from that point.
},
{
    377.92,382.22
     Once we get to that point, let's tuck the chin a little bit, pull forward at a nice
},
{
    382.22,387.48
     slight angle towards the floor, and this is what's going to cause that traction into the neck.
},
{
    387.48,390.2
     This should feel like a very stable movement.
},
{
    390.2,394.84
     Only go to the point where you feel comfortable again, hold this one for 15 to 30 seconds,
},
{
    394.84,400.44
     you're just going to relax and then you're going to repeat this up to five times just
},
{
    400.44,410.04
     again pulling a little bit further each time to increase a little bit more joint space and relieve pressure into those bulging discs in the neck. So this
},
{
    410.04,413.84
     is how we can also use our lower body weight and gravity to aid us in that
},
{
    413.84,418.04
     self-traction of the neck. Let's go to the edge of the bed and place the back
},
{
    418.04,422.16
     side of the arm flat against it like this for our anchor point. Let's take the
},
{
    422.16,427.76
     towel, put it on the base of the skull, take the two ends right here with our hands and just pull forward with it to make sure that it's
},
{
    427.76,432.64
     hooked. We're also going to tuck the chin very slightly. From there I want to increase the
},
{
    432.64,437.6
     pull or the traction into the neck by driving forward with my hands. Then we're just going to
},
{
    437.6,446.56
     simply lower the butt down towards the floor as far as we feel comfortable. It's going to increase the traction into the neck,
},
{
    446.56,448.76
     again, only to your comfort level.
},
{
    448.76,452.56
     Hold this for about 15 to 30 seconds from there.
},
{
    452.56,454.64
     You're just going to relax,
},
{
    454.64,458.36
     and then you're going to repeat this up to five times,
},
{
    458.36,460.44
     again, taking the butt towards the heels
},
{
    460.44,462.96
     just a little bit further each time
},
{
    462.96,467.0
     to help take more pressure off that neck bulging
},
{
    467.0,468.0
     disc.
},
{
    468.0,473.8
     One of the easiest ways to be able to traction the neck is to use a pull-up band.
},
{
    473.8,479.08
     Again, I'll leave the link for the exact one I'm using in this video's description.
},
{
    479.08,481.0
     You want one in a closed loop.
},
{
    481.0,489.38
     You're just going to place it on the door handle of the opposite side of the door and then close the door to make sure that it is obviously sturdy. There should
},
{
    489.38,495.56
     be a lot of tension being built up. What I also did was I put a rolled up towel right
},
{
    495.56,501.36
     over the pull up band for extra comfort. Let's place it right on the back of the skull right
},
{
    501.36,508.78
     here to make sure that it is hooked. The easy way to get traction is just to simply slide away from the door.
},
{
    508.78,513.62
     The more that you slide away from the door, the more tension is going to be placed into
},
{
    513.62,514.62
     the neck.
},
{
    514.62,518.48
     What I also like to do is just do a slight chin tuck to make sure my neck is in good
},
{
    518.48,523.96
     position and just keep going forward until you feel a very good stretch, that traction
},
{
    523.96,525.28
     into the neck.
},
{
    525.28,528.6
     You can hold this position for an extended period of time.
},
{
    528.6,531.44
     I sometimes hold it up to a minute myself.
},
{
    531.44,534.32
     I just do nice slow controlled breathing when I need a breather.
},
{
    534.32,539.98
     I just slide back towards the door and then from there I just increase that traction by
},
{
    539.98,542.72
     sliding further away.
},
{
    542.72,547.36
     Try to do five complete repetitions of this and each time just try
},
{
    547.36,552.16
     to go a little bit further with it. Here's another great method using a pull-up band.
},
{
    552.16,557.44
     Let's take the pull-up band and grab the two ends like this. I also put a towel in the middle
},
{
    557.44,562.56
     for extra comfort. We want to position that pull-up band right at the base of the skull to
},
{
    562.56,568.36
     hook it. I'm going to go up to a door frame and I'm just going to place the two ends of it right up
},
{
    568.36,572.64
     against that door frame. What I want to do from there is just take a step
},
{
    572.64,577.44
     backwards and you can kind of do a scissor stance for this for a little
},
{
    577.44,581.92
     bit of a little bit more stability. With this it should start to hook the base
},
{
    581.92,585.52
     of the skull. Let's tuck the ching just very slightly.
},
{
    585.52,590.72
     What I'm going to do from there is take my hands and start to go upwards like this up
},
{
    590.72,591.92
     the door frame.
},
{
    591.92,596.44
     When you do this, you're going to notice that traction is being built into the neck.
},
{
    596.44,598.44
     Only go to your comfort level.
},
{
    598.44,602.56
     Once you hit that point, hold this for about 15 seconds.
},
{
    602.56,605.64
     If you need a little bit more, and this is the great part about it,
},
{
    605.64,610.64
     what you can do is lower your body weight down like this.
},
{
    610.76,611.6
     And I tell you what,
},
{
    611.6,615.6
     this is a great amount of traction into my neck right now.
},
{
    615.6,617.52
     Just nice, slow, controlled breathing.
},
{
    617.52,620.48
     Try to hold this for 15 to 30 seconds.
},
{
    620.48,622.96
     You're just going to relax like this,
},
{
    622.96,624.28
     take a bit of a breather,
},
{
    624.28,626.08
     and then from there,
},
{
    626.08,630.84
     just simply repeat this up to five times, trying to go a little bit further with it
},
{
    630.84,635.0
     each time to be able to open up those joint spaces.
},
