     Hey everybody, it's Dr. Joe and Mr. Bear, Mr. Bear, and today we're going to show you high atrial hernia treatments.
},
{
    7.28,9.28
     So let's get started.
},
{
    9.28,11.28
     Disclaimer alert, disclaimer alert.

},
{
    23.68,29.36
     there. That helps my channel grow and it allows me to continue to make videos for everybody. So with a high-eatle hernia, a lot of times it's trying to just get that
},
{
    29.36,34.56
     hernia that comes, that stomach area coming up through that little hole to
},
{
    34.56,39.36
     get it back down. So one of the easiest things to do is just start off with some
},
{
    39.36,43.6
     diaphragmatic breathing and that's just belly breathing and it's pretty easy to
},
{
    43.6,45.52
     do. It helps with the pelvic floor
},
{
    45.52,51.04
     as well. It helps draw it down so that brings the stomach down to help pull that high-o-lhearnia
},
{
    51.04,56.56
     down. So diaphragmatic breathing or belly breathing is really just you're trying to bring the air into
},
{
    56.56,62.24
     your belly area. Instead of what we a lot of times we do is chest breathing. So an easy way to do that
},
{
    62.24,68.68
     is place one hand on your belly and one hand on your chest. And what you want to try to do is the hand on your chest
},
{
    68.68,72.0
     doesn't really move. It might move a little bit but not a whole lot. But you
},
{
    72.0,76.44
     want to see your hand down at your belly move in and out. Now not forcing it in
},
{
    76.44,82.56
     and out but trying to bring the air down into the belly. So I'm gonna do it.
},
{
    82.56,87.0
     You might not see a whole lot but I just want you to see.
},
{
    97.36,101.04
     So you can see each time I do it I was able to get a little bit more into the
},
{
    101.04,104.84
     belly. If you haven't done it before it might be kind of hard to get it down.
},
{
    104.84,107.0
     But that's why the hands there are nice to see
},
{
    107.0,110.28
     because if you keep seeing your chest area move up and down that means you're
},
{
    110.28,112.92
     breathing up here. But like I said, you really want to breathe into that belly
},
{
    112.92,116.12
     because that helps kind of pull everything downward to give that high
},
{
    116.12,121.36
     little hernia down. So then the next one is lying down doing some bridges. You can
},
{
    121.36,127.38
     do this in your bed even before you get out of bed. In the mornings a lot of the treatment is nice to do in the morning so that's a lot of
},
{
    127.38,131.96
     times when people feel it the most. So a bridge, a very simple bridge, you might
},
{
    131.96,135.96
     have seen me do these before, but this time we're going to hold it up at the top
},
{
    135.96,140.8
     for about 15 seconds. So feet are about hip width apart and when you come up
},
{
    140.8,146.68
     you're really kind of driving your knees forward and coming up one segment at a time.
},
{
    146.68,153.4
     So once you get to here, if you can comfortably stay for about 15 seconds, that's what you
},
{
    153.4,154.4
     want to do.
},
{
    154.4,156.76
     You just want to kind of hold this position here.
},
{
    156.76,163.08
     And then once you get to that 15 seconds, nice and slowly come back down.
},
{
    163.08,166.96
     So we're kind of trying to strengthen the area now so that it's
},
{
    166.96,172.48
     not going to keep moving around in there. So again just just holding it up in this position. You
},
{
    172.48,177.6
     might not be able to get as straight in a line as I'm right now. So even if you start off here
},
{
    177.6,181.92
     that's okay if you haven't done bridges before it might be kind of hard. You might not be able to
},
{
    181.92,187.8
     hold it for the 15 seconds to start off with but that's what you want to work up to. And you can just do some nice breathing
},
{
    187.8,193.04
     in here too. You know I'm talking, but you know do that nice belly breathing
},
{
    193.04,196.76
     while you're up in this position and then slowly come back down. Since you're
},
{
    196.76,200.2
     doing that hold, you only really need to do those about three to five times. You
},
{
    200.2,205.8
     don't have to do anything really big with that. So then you're just going to roll over and again you can still be in the bed doing these. You don't have to do anything really big with that. So then you're just gonna roll over.
},
{
    205.8,207.46
     And again, you can still be in the bed doing these.
},
{
    207.46,209.16
     You don't have to do them on the floor,
},
{
    209.16,210.64
     though some people like to.
},
{
    210.64,213.76
     And then you're just gonna go into a cat cow
},
{
    213.76,214.86
     or a cat dog.
},
{
    214.86,218.36
     I like to call it dog just because I like dogs, as you know.
},
{
    218.36,221.32
     But it traditionally is called a cat cow.
},
{
    221.32,224.6
     So hands are pretty much underneath your shoulders.
},
{
    224.6,225.6
     They're not far out, they're not back. You want it pretty much underneath your shoulders. They're not far out,
},
{
    225.6,228.84
     they're not back. You want it pretty much straight up and down. You want your knees
},
{
    228.84,234.84
     about hip width apart, which is usually your two fists together. And then as you
},
{
    234.84,241.08
     breathe in, you're going into your cow or your dog and you're looking kind of up
},
{
    241.08,245.8
     or straightforward, dropping those hips and then coming in to your
},
{
    245.8,250.12
     cat breathing out and then tucking in your chin really trying to arch it as
},
{
    250.12,252.88
     much as you can.
},
{
    257.96,263.76
     So you can see you don't have to do a big hold you know just a pause make sure
},
{
    263.76,272.72
     you're doing some nice breathing maybe maybe three seconds each way. And really get that stretch. You can do five each,
},
{
    272.72,277.44
     just working on that. You can do these a couple times throughout the day. So the
},
{
    277.44,281.0
     next stretch is going to be a QL stretch or a quadratus lumborum stretch. And so
},
{
    281.0,290.2
     this is really again just to kind of lengthen up the chest area to make sure and pull down that hernia a little bit. I usually suggest doing both sides. So
},
{
    290.2,296.6
     you're just going to sit on one side and then bring the other hand up. So I'm stretching
},
{
    296.6,301.32
     this side. So I'm going to kind of lean into my hand. I want my weight to be over on the
},
{
    301.32,309.44
     hand that I'm sitting on. And then I'm going to bring the other one just kind of up and over and then I'm pushing my upper body this
},
{
    309.44,315.08
     way. So I'm kind of getting almost like a a C or a curve motion really to get that
},
{
    315.08,318.72
     nice stretch in there. I'm looking up towards my hand. I'm going to take a
},
{
    318.72,324.32
     thumbnail picture right now and then you can take one with me too. But holding
},
{
    324.32,326.06
     that stretch for about 30
},
{
    326.06,330.86
     seconds and then coming back down again like so you can stretch both sides. So
},
{
    330.86,335.7
     sitting on this one shifting that weight over coming up and over and then just
},
{
    335.7,339.82
     kind of arching into it like that. Looking up either towards my elbow or
},
{
    339.82,346.36
     towards my hand 30 seconds three times on each side. So then the next one is very similar,
},
{
    346.36,348.76
     but this one's more of a thoracic side bend,
},
{
    348.76,351.2
     but still again, the idea is opening up that area,
},
{
    351.2,353.28
     kind of pulling that stomach back down
},
{
    353.28,355.0
     to get everything back down.
},
{
    355.0,356.84
     So this time you're just gonna take your hands,
},
{
    356.84,358.84
     you can either clasp them behind your head
},
{
    358.84,359.68
     or behind your neck.
},
{
    359.68,361.16
     I kind of like behind my head,
},
{
    361.16,363.24
     I feel like that's a little bit more comfortable.
},
{
    363.24,367.68
     But this time, since it's the thoracic area, you're really just almost like you're
},
{
    367.68,371.2
     bringing one elbow up. So now this stretch is going to be a little bit more
},
{
    371.2,376.24
     here versus the QL is a little bit lower. So then I'm just going up into that
},
{
    376.24,380.04
     stretch just kind of arching in. I'm kind of looking up towards the ceiling just
},
{
    380.04,384.52
     to help with that. This one doesn't have to be a full 30 second stretch. It can be
},
{
    384.52,387.52
     maybe like a 10 to 15 second stretch
},
{
    387.52,389.6
     and then alternating sides and coming up.
},
{
    389.6,392.96
     But you're really kind of trying to do a side bend motion
},
{
    392.96,395.24
     and really bringing that elbow up.
},
{
    395.24,399.34
     So 10 to 15 seconds, three to five times on each side,
},
{
    399.34,401.08
     really to get that stretched out.
},
{
    401.08,402.92
     And the last ones are gonna be standing up.
},
{
    402.92,404.24
     So the next stretch standing up
},
{
    404.24,406.56
     is just gonna be a side side bending stretch so kind of like
},
{
    406.56,410.96
     when we receded but now you're standing so you can get the full body stretch. So
},
{
    410.96,414.52
     if you want to stretch this side you're going to bring this arm up and kind of
},
{
    414.52,419.4
     slide the other one down your side. So as you're coming up really reach across
},
{
    419.4,424.52
     your body and push out that hip so you're getting that full stretch through
},
{
    424.52,429.28
     there. Again just lengthening that upper body, getting that nice stretch. Again this one
},
{
    429.28,433.52
     doesn't have to be a full 30 second stretch. It can be a 10 to 15 second
},
{
    433.52,436.96
     stretch but if you want to hold it longer than 30 seconds you can. And then
},
{
    436.96,441.48
     switching sides so this one's sliding down and this one is coming up and over.
},
{
    441.48,446.12
     Really pushing out the hip, really kind of making that curve with your whole body,
},
{
    446.12,448.92
     feeling it all the way through there.
},
{
    448.92,452.44
     15 to 30 seconds to your choice, three to five times.
},
{
    452.44,454.92
     So then the last one is just gonna be
},
{
    454.92,457.76
     a nice deep breathing with an upper arm,
},
{
    457.76,459.12
     kind of jumping jack motion.
},
{
    459.12,462.08
     And again, this just kind of lifts up the rib cage.
},
{
    462.08,466.0
     I like this as just a relaxing exercise too, but again this helps
},
{
    466.0,471.2
     lengthen everything again to pull that stomach back down so it doesn't get stuck in that hole
},
{
    471.2,476.88
     there. So all you're going to do is kind of come up like you do jumping jack with your hands out to
},
{
    476.88,483.12
     the side and up and as you come up breathe in deeply and when you get to the ceiling take that
},
{
    483.12,485.0
     extra deep breath almost like you're trying to touch the ceiling, take that extra deep breath, almost like you're
},
{
    485.0,488.44
     trying to touch the ceiling, and then as you breathe out, come back down. So it's
},
{
    488.44,495.56
     like this. I'm breathing in. I can breathe out now, and then really high as
},
{
    495.56,502.88
     much as I can breathing in. Almost like I'm lifting up that rib cage, and then
},
{
    502.88,507.12
     coming back down. So I'll just do that all the way through without talking.
},
{
    516.32,520.32
     So since that's a lot, that's really stretching everything out. You can just do three to five,
},
{
    520.32,524.64
     whatever works for you. Not doing a whole lot to get anything irritated, but again just really
},
{
    524.64,527.2
     trying to stretch everything out. So there you have it,
},
{
    527.2,530.28
     those were ways to treat a hiatal hernia. If you'd like to help support my channel,
