     Bob and Brad the two most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    8.52,13.88
     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist, Brad Heineck physical therapist, we are the most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    13.88,19.68
     And our opinion of course Bob, seven best exercises to increase blood flow and circulation in your legs and feet
},
{
    19.92,23.28
     These are some things that are not evident to a lot of people
},
{
    23.28,27.58
     I don't think a lot of people realize that if they're not getting a lot of flow to their legs
},
{
    27.58,34.04
     You need to actually exercise in order to get more profusion of blood to the muscles, right blood contraction and relaxation
},
{
    34.84,36.04
     relaxation is
},
{
    36.04,41.0
     Part of the key to get fluid and that blood moving, right and also stretching
},
{
    41.2,43.2
     So we're gonna show you a bunch of things you can try
},
{
    43.68,49.06
     If you are new to our channel by the way, please take a second to subscribe to us other will come out and slap you
},
{
    50.46,53.76
     Okay, I guess we won't do that. We provide videos
},
{
    53.76,59.92
     And they come after us and pain-free and we upload every day and also please go over to Facebook
},
{
    60.08,62.08
     Otherwise we'll slap you
},
{
    62.5,64.5
     Okay, no I won't and
},
{
    64.76,68.76
     Like us over there because we like to be liked. Did you get up on the wrong side of bed?
},
{
    68.76,73.2
     I did, I fell off the bed. All right the first one Brad, let's talk about the first one
},
{
    73.2,75.64
     This is the easiest one, this is the one that everybody can do
},
{
    76.14,80.82
     Just you got to incorporate some walking into your life, the more you can walk the more
},
{
    81.6,83.6
     You're gonna get blood flowing to the
},
{
    84.52,86.72
     extremities of the feet and a lot of
},
{
    86.72,90.0
     for some people it's uncomfortable because they might have what is called cloudication
},
{
    90.96,97.44
     where they walk so far and they start getting pain in their calves because the blood's not flowing
},
{
    97.44,101.84
     like it should and what you want to do is walk up to that point and then try to go a little
},
{
    101.84,109.3
     further every day because eventually again you hope that eventually you're gonna get more blood
},
{
    109.3,113.24
     flow to the muscles by exercising them. Right and then with these other
},
{
    113.24,117.32
     exercises and stretches that should help increase the ability to walk further.
},
{
    117.32,122.6
     Right, next one Brad is very simple you're just gonna do some body weight
},
{
    122.6,127.48
     squats we call it you can just do it on the back of a chair. Do you want to do a break?
},
{
    127.48,129.48
     You bet right here
},
{
    131.04,133.04
     You got me Lonnie?
},
{
    133.6,137.6
     So you can hold a chair or whatever you need for balance, okay?
},
{
    137.68,140.52
     Good posture though. We like to do things with good posture
},
{
    140.52,144.16
     So we're not gonna squat forward like this which is a common mistake
},
{
    144.56,144.88
     So we're not gonna squat forward like this which is a common mistake
},
{
    150.4,150.48
     But we're up tall and just a nice gentle squat go down as far as you feel comfortable
},
{
    153.0,153.52
     Yeah, you can do real shallow ones. You don't I mean
},
{
    159.0,161.52
     You can start out here believe me. You're getting all the muscles working even when you're real shallow like this You know if you happen to have pretty good leg strength
},
{
    161.52,164.44
     You're welcome to go down farther as long as you feel comfortable
},
{
    164.44,167.74
     You can do 10 to 15 of these and everything pretty good leg strength, you're welcome to go down farther as long as you feel comfortable You can do 10 to 15 of these and everything feels good
},
{
    167.74,168.4
     You know you get the
},
{
    168.4,173.58
     Prosiculation going in these large muscle groups. Try to keep the knees behind the foot. I mean right
},
{
    173.58,175.88
     Yeah, go ahead. What we're saying here is
},
{
    176.72,180.38
     We preach this constantly, but if we run a plumb line there
},
{
    180.38,183.2
     It's better on your knees if they don't go past the foot
},
{
    184.08,188.1
     And that's in one reason why we kind of like the ball on the wall don't we Brad?
},
{
    188.1,190.96
     Sure, because you want to throw it to me real quick?
},
{
    191.84,193.84
     Brad's got to go get a ball
},
{
    194.88,196.88
     Look at that
},
{
    197.08,202.28
     All right, if you have one of these or if you don't by the way all the products that we love
},
{
    202.28,206.8
     We always put down in our list below in our Amazon list in the description
},
{
    206.8,211.62
     But what's nice about this especially if you have good grippy shoes, it's real easy to
},
{
    212.04,214.96
     Keep your knees behind the front of the foot with this
},
{
    216.2,218.92
     This is how I do them. I do these almost every day
},
{
    219.68,225.94
     Just a good functional strength anyone your back is protected. It's just really easy to do my wife does these every day
},
{
    225.94,231.6
     I don't know what she does. She wakes up in the morning and in like five seconds later
},
{
    231.6,233.56
     She's doing these really I'm like
},
{
    234.0,236.9
     You know I lay on the ground for a little bit and I roll around
},
{
    237.16,239.4
     I'm trying to stretch and she's like
},
{
    240.68,242.68
     Doing these things right over here
},
{
    243.48,246.32
     So anyway the beauty of the ball
},
{
    247.24,254.16
     All right next one Brad. This is one we all can do throughout the day too. You're gonna have to pan down here Lonnie
},
{
    254.6,257.44
     Sorry, I'm over here now. If you look at my feet
},
{
    258.0,260.52
     All you're gonna do is gonna raise your heels and
},
{
    261.6,265.12
     Then you're gonna raise your toes throughout the day you should be doing these
},
{
    265.84,271.68
     My fourth grade teacher used to do these Brad. Really? Yep. I remember I just really stuck in my head
},
{
    271.68,276.28
     It's like she's like no my doctor told me I'm supposed to do this because I'm having trouble with swelling and
},
{
    276.6,282.0
     Lack of circulation in my legs so she throughout the day she'd be teaching and she'd be going up and down like this
},
{
    282.0,285.5
     It's amazing what sticks in your head. Yeah it is so she was a nice teacher
},
{
    285.5,286.56
     Oh good
},
{
    286.56,288.56
     All right unlike my third grade teacher
},
{
    290.56,292.98
     All right next one Brad is the foam roller
},
{
    293.68,295.68
     These workout really good for
},
{
    296.08,297.64
     getting
},
{
    297.64,299.64
     perfusion of blood into the muscles
},
{
    300.2,307.16
     Tom Brady his workout the TB12. I don't have the book here, he uses vibrating foam rollers
},
{
    307.16,313.32
     Today we got foam rollers from FEI, which is, we'll put a little plug in for them,
},
{
    314.32,320.8
     Fabrication Enterprises Inc. I'll have a separate link for them below, if you are a physical therapist or occupational therapist
},
{
    320.8,327.58
     You should definitely get their catalogs, they've got a lot of good products They got a lot of good products and these are a couple of their foam rollers
},
{
    328.06,331.78
     This is under the Can-Do brand. I like that name, Can-Do. You're right
},
{
    332.36,339.52
     You can do it. And this is actually their black roll and they wanted to promote these too. They're kind of smaller
},
{
    339.54,346.5
     This one's pretty dense isn't it? Yeah, that's aggressive. How about this one? That's a little softer. So which one are you gonna use today Brad?
},
{
    346.5,348.5
     Well, I'm going with the pink. Okay
},
{
    349.88,351.0
     Okay
},
{
    351.0,355.32
     So it depends on where I'm gonna start from the ankle and we'll work up
},
{
    357.04,363.66
     Yeah, this is a good one to do because a lot of people have a lot of poor circulation in the calves don't they?
},
{
    363.66,366.1
     Yeah, so you're gonna work that you can do
},
{
    366.48,370.1
     Yeah, actually should show up well against them. Yeah it should. There you go
},
{
    370.2,374.9
     You know if you want to get more aggressive you go like this and that gets pretty aggressive
},
{
    374.9,378.18
     You know if I wasn't real tough I'd be hollering right now, so I'm going back to here
},
{
    378.18,381.92
     You're one of the toughest guys I know in this room. Oh, yeah. Now you're right there
},
{
    381.92,390.02
     You might as well go right up to the hamstrings Yeah, the hamstrings I'm gonna cross my legs on that one right away and go like that probably
},
{
    390.62,392.12
     With a one this narrow
},
{
    392.12,397.12
     I would just do one leg at a time because it's not quite wide enough if I had the three foot one you had in your
},
{
    397.16,402.92
     In your hand like that yeah, then I could do both legs a little more easily, but it works works just fine
},
{
    402.92,405.16
     These are nice compact you throw it into your bag
},
{
    405.16,407.16
     You know your gym bag or whatever
},
{
    408.52,414.88
     Then I would yeah, I would definitely do even these the for shin splint spread. Yep, I'm gonna get there
},
{
    414.88,419.86
     You're gonna get there you're rolling. Yeah, so he's doing the front thigh and now he's getting a little bit in the IT band even
},
{
    421.24,427.28
     You're not gonna go on the shin bone but no that anterior too so you're a little bit off to the side
},
{
    427.28,432.86
     I started doing these by the way. Oh really? Yeah, I did it this morning. I did the calf and I did the
},
{
    433.66,439.58
     Because I was getting a little bit of shin splints and it seems like it's really helped. Now I have a lot of weight through my other leg
},
{
    439.58,445.22
     I'm not putting all my body weight on there because that would be a little uncomfortable for me, but it all depends on the individual
},
{
    446.12,452.82
     foam rollers you'd be surprised at how pliable they make the muscles and how quickly you can move things along
},
{
    452.82,457.0
     It gets that circulation moving. All right next one is the leg wedge Brad
},
{
    459.6,464.48
     I'm actually gonna have you lay down because you fit better on it. Okay. Yeah, I'll get you a pillow
},
{
    464.48,468.8
     I'm actually gonna have you lay down because you fit better on it. Okay. Yeah, I'll get you a pillow.
},
{
    472.0,474.32
     Got you a cervical pillow. Oh, fancy one. Silky
},
{
    477.64,482.08
     There we go. All right, what's nice about the leg wedge It's just a good one, you know to get your feet up a little bit elevated
},
{
    482.08,486.88
     So the it's gonna help prevent the swelling from happening in the feet
},
{
    486.88,493.68
     and then when you're in this position it's a great position to go ahead and do the ankle foot flexion
},
{
    493.68,499.2
     and dorsal flexion and planar flexion and then circles too. Now something about this leg wedge
},
{
    499.2,506.08
     the contact it makes here really provides comfort for that low back. Yeah, we've said this many times
},
{
    506.08,508.48
     It's just a weird sensation
},
{
    508.48,513.44
     I didn't believe until Brad showed me this and is that it just feels really good on your back for some reason
},
{
    513.44,520.72
     So this is a great way to take a nap or you know if you're trying to relax after a hard day of being on your feet
},
{
    521.04,526.28
     Get your feet up. I've had one patient had swelling problems, he liked it
},
{
    526.28,532.08
     but he also added a pillow on the end, on the end too. Right right under his calf, even elevated a
},
{
    532.08,538.44
     little bit more, has provided that support, that we're just talking about. Alright the next one Brad
},
{
    538.44,548.64
     is this is a machine that we use in all our clinics, oh yeah, all five of our clinics actually, six
},
{
    548.64,554.32
     clinics actually, and what we do is we actually put a two by four underneath
},
{
    554.32,558.36
     the front, we don't need to do that right now Brad, but it just it puts it at a
},
{
    558.36,562.4
     little bit better angle, these were designed, it's an elliptical machine and
},
{
    562.4,566.8
     again we have it down below if you want to see what it costs I mean usually around 80 bucks I think
},
{
    567.36,570.08
     With free shipping, right, yeah somewhere in there
},
{
    570.08,575.88
     Yeah, anyway it was designed to use standing up, but we use it with all of our patients sitting down and
},
{
    576.6,579.6
     It's just a really smooth glide, right?
},
{
    579.6,580.8
     I mean it's just
},
{
    580.8,584.68
     So it's just and you can see I'm getting some my ankles going up and down like this
},
{
    584.8,589.94
     Flipping up and down so it's just a great one for getting a little more circulation into your legs and
},
{
    590.18,592.66
     Feet plus getting a little cardio a little exercise
},
{
    592.82,595.3
     Because the ankles and knees and a little bit of hip
},
{
    595.3,599.88
     Yeah, and there's a resistance knob on there if you want to make it a little bit tougher
},
{
    600.08,605.16
     But you know this is one you know I got one of these for my mom and she puts it in front of the TV
},
{
    605.16,610.04
     She just watches TV and sits there and the girl that works for us Rosie
},
{
    610.32,614.3
     She's right now. I just had a knee replacement and she does the same thing
},
{
    614.3,619.68
     She just sits in front of the TV and now if the person has stiff ankles
},
{
    620.84,624.04
     That's when in particular with an elderly person
},
{
    624.04,629.48
     That's when like Bob was talking about you put in one or two two-by-fours under here to elevate it
},
{
    629.48,634.64
     And it just makes it'll easier for someone that's weak or has some tight joints to get it around
},
{
    634.64,637.22
     Yeah, Brad actually is fabricated of these wood
},
{
    638.12,639.52
     What would you call them?
},
{
    639.52,646.36
     Fixtures for all of ours and so on and all of our units that we have those it's over there right now in fact
},
{
    646.84,649.68
     We could get one but that's all right. Yeah, you got the idea. So anyway
},
{
    650.12,652.72
     It just works out really good and these are very durable
},
{
    652.72,657.52
     We're using them for like six hours a day, right and they go on for years and years
},
{
    657.52,663.24
     They do, for home use you're never gonna have a problem. All right the last one Brad is you can actually use
},
{
    663.96,665.4
     You can stretch you want to stretch the muscles if you want if one Brad is you can actually use, you can stretch, you
},
{
    665.4,670.16
     want to stretch the muscles if you want, if you can and you can do that you
},
{
    670.16,673.84
     know just manually or a lot of times we recommend this stretch out strap, this is
},
{
    673.84,678.24
     a yoga strap, what's nice about this so you can start stretching the calf
},
{
    678.24,683.24
     muscles and then you got the strap so it's really easy to do and you can just
},
{
    683.24,687.48
     put your hands through here like this, and now I'm stretching
},
{
    687.48,690.8
     Especially if you have maybe a little arthritis in your hands and you can't
},
{
    692.24,695.2
     Grab on and just you can use your wrist and pull
},
{
    695.72,697.72
     You can go right in from this
},
{
    698.16,700.16
     Right into a hamstring stretch
},
{
    701.72,706.68
     Well my hamstring is a little, let's go this way, a little shaky there wasn't I Brad?
},
{
    708.6,710.92
     Okay, and then you can go into a hip
},
{
    711.16,714.26
     This is the kind of thing you can do, you know getting out of bed in the morning
},
{
    714.26,716.76
     Right, maybe you could start doing this because you're kind of sleepy
},
{
    716.76,718.72
     Maybe you could pull this strap off and start
},
{
    718.72,722.98
     Yeah, be it my transition to get out of bed, you can lay on your side like this and
},
{
    723.52,725.16
     This maybe put it down further
},
{
    726.16,729.98
     I'm gonna stretch the front of my thigh. So he's getting the quadriceps
},
{
    730.28,736.32
     So I'm taking one of the loops here and I can go all the way. Oh, I still did it wrong
},
{
    737.52,739.52
     I'm gonna go like this
},
{
    740.04,744.96
     Lay on your stomach Bob. Okay. See what's going on. It works as well. There you go
},
{
    745.88,747.88
     Good stretch that way
},
{
    748.88,751.4
     Any other ones we want to do with the strap rat or?
},
{
    752.52,756.08
     Nope that pretty much covers most of it for legs
},
{
    756.84,759.08
     You gotta get the major muscles there, so
},
