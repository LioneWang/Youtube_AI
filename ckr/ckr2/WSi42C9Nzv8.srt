     Examination of the lymph nodes A thorough clinical examination should usually
},
{
    9.36,16.72
     include both a systematic inspection and palpation of the clinically relevant lymph node stations.
},
{
    16.72,25.0
     The most important stations are the head and neck area, the axilla and the inguinal area.
},
{
    25.0,32.32
     Consequently, the lymph nodes are usually examined from cranial to caudal.
},
{
    32.32,36.44
     Around one-third of all lymph nodes are located in the head and neck area, where they can
},
{
    36.44,40.16
     be found superficially and are therefore easily palpable.
},
{
    40.16,46.42
     The following lymph nodes should be included in every palpation, suboxypetal, retro and
},
{
    46.42,56.38
     pre-aricular, submandibular, submental, posterior triangle of the neck, and those within the
},
{
    56.38,61.9
     area of the internal jugular vein, which lie deep within the neck and may be palpated ventral
},
{
    61.9,65.0
     or dorsal to the sternocleidomastoid muscle.
},
{
    66.0,70.0
     Additionally, the superclavicular lymph nodes should be palpated as well,
},
{
    70.0,75.0
     since enlargement of these lymph nodes is often associated with malignancies.
},
{
    76.0,81.0
     Abdominal tumors that metastasize via the lymphatic system, such as gastric cancer,
},
{
    81.0,87.0
     will often result in an enlarged, virtual node in the left superclavicular fossa.
},
{
    93.0,96.0
     Carefully palpate the individual lymph node stations.
},
{
    98.0,109.0
     To facilitate differentiation between lymph nodes and muscles, the area that is palpated should be as relaxed as possible.
},
{
    109.0,115.16
     Every palpable lymph node is considered enlarged.
},
{
    115.16,121.24
     If there is enlargement, pay attention to consistency, tenderness, mobility, the number
},
{
    121.24,126.0
     of enlarged lymph nodes and any erythema in the affected area.
},
{
    128.0,134.0
     Multiple fused lymph nodes are referred to as conglomerates and are highly suspicious for malignancy.
},
{
    143.0,149.28
     After palpating the head and neck, continue by examining the axillary lymph nodes, which
},
{
    149.28,154.0
     can be divided into different groups as well.
},
{
    154.0,160.16
     The pictoral or anterior group is located in the anterior axillary fold and is responsible
},
{
    160.16,166.0
     for the majority of lymphatic drainage of the chest and chest wall.
},
{
    173.0,177.0
     The subscapular, or posterior lymph node group, is palpable deep within the posterior axillary fold. It drains parts of the arms and the chest wall.
},
{
    178.0,185.68
     The brachial, or lateral lymph nodes, drain the majority of the arms and can be palpated in the area of the proximal humerus.
},
{
    187.28,191.28
     All of the lymph node groups just mentioned then drain into the central group,
},
{
    191.28,198.0
     which is palpable at the base of the axilla. The subclavicular or apical group represents the last
},
{
    198.0,205.04
     lymph node station before the lymphatic vessels drain into the venous system. This group should be examined together with the
},
{
    205.04,211.56
     cervical or axillary lymph nodes. In this patient, the examiner starts by palpating
},
{
    211.56,218.04
     the pectoral group behind the lateral aspect of the pectoralis major muscle. Afterwards,
},
{
    218.04,227.0
     he palpates the central group, followed by the posterior group in the area of the posterior axillary fold and the brachial group of the upper arm.
},
{
    230.48,233.28
     Distinguishing between lymph nodes and surrounding muscles
},
{
    233.28,236.48
     is best achieved when the arm is relaxed and lowered.
},
{
    239.48,244.0
     Afterwards, the superficial lymph nodes of the inguinal area should be palpated.
},
{
    245.0,247.0
     In other words, the superficial lymph nodes of the inguinal area should be palpated.
},
{
    251.0,253.0
     They are divided into a horizontal and a vertical group.
},
{
    259.0,260.0
     The horizontal group lies below the inguinal ligament and can therefore be palpated parallel to its course.
},
{
    265.6,269.04
     This group is responsible for draining parts of the external genitalia, trunk and lower back.
},
{
    273.36,276.4
     The vertical group is located adjacent to the great proximal syphenis vein and drains lymphatic fluid from the lower extremity.
},
{
    280.24,285.0
     Examination of the inguinal lymph nodes is best performed with the patient lying down.
},
{
    289.5,294.0
     As a lymphatic organ, the spleen should always be a part of the lymph node assessment,
},
{
    294.0,299.0
     since splinomegaly can hint at a systematic inflammatory or malignant illness.
},
{
    304.5,308.6
     The spleen is generally not palpable in healthy adults.
},
{
    308.6,314.66
     A pathologically enlarged spleen is palpated under the left costal margin during inspiration
},
{
    314.66,318.96
     as the inferior edge descends to the examiner's fingertips.
},
{
    318.96,326.0
     If an enlarged spleen is already suspected, palpation should begin further down.
},
{
    326.0,None
     The examination may be facilitated by gently lifting the left flank of the patient ventrally. you
