     Hi, I'm Dr. Adam Fields. Welcome to Beginner Shoulder Rehabilitation.
},
{
    5.0,9.5
     We are actually going to do some circles. Put your palms up like this and circle backwards.
},
{
    9.5,13.5
     This is a little warm-up here. You're going to start really small circles.
},
{
    13.5,16.5
     Some of you can start them down here if this is too much,
},
{
    16.5,20.5
     or even you can use your arms like this to make them a little less weighty.
},
{
    20.5,26.08
     But for now, if you can, do the nice big circle. Make them bigger. Good.
},
{
    26.08,31.52
     Chest is up. A lot of you have told me, hey, those four shoulder videos that you
},
{
    31.52,35.88
     came out for shoulder rehab, too intense for me. So we've gone to making them a
},
{
    35.88,40.86
     little bit easier. Now make those shoulders smaller. Good. Now make them go the
},
{
    40.86,46.52
     opposite direction and make them bigger again. Here we go. Let's get you so some good shoulders.
},
{
    46.52,48.32
     Stretch them out.
},
{
    48.32,50.6
     Say good morning, shoulders.
},
{
    50.6,52.2
     Hello, I'm here.
},
{
    52.2,53.92
     Let's make them strong.
},
{
    53.92,55.76
     Let's make them feel good.
},
{
    55.76,58.0
     Let's go back small again.
},
{
    58.88,60.28
     Good, chest is up.
},
{
    60.28,62.56
     Abs are braced.
},
{
    62.56,67.04
     Good, back is arched, but not too much. Your core is working for you right now.
},
{
    67.04,71.22
     Shoulders, you're going to feel a little stretch in your biceps and then you feel
},
{
    71.22,77.04
     that stretch kind of go. Okay, so let's just bring the shoulders down and we're
},
{
    77.04,81.16
     just going to move the arms just a little bit like this. This is called knocking
},
{
    81.16,91.6
     on the door of life. If this doesn't feel good, don't do it or just barely do it. But if it feels good, go for it. Usually I use this more in my shoulder impingement
},
{
    91.6,96.96
     videos, but we use it a little bit here just to put some blood into your shoulders. Get them ready
},
{
    96.96,111.64
     for the exercises. Good. This is great for frozen shoulder, even though this is not a frozen shoulder video. All right, keep those abs engaged. Work from your abs. Work from your abs. Move the arms from
},
{
    111.64,120.72
     the abs. That's it. You got it. Good. Let's do some scapular stabilization now. Your abs are
},
{
    120.72,127.2
     engaged. You're feeling them, right? You take a breath in and you pull your scapula down
},
{
    127.2,129.68
     towards your glutes.
},
{
    129.68,133.76
     So it's pull them down like that.
},
{
    133.76,135.12
     It's a very small movement.
},
{
    135.12,137.68
     Take a breath and pull them down again.
},
{
    140.72,150.62
     Big breath in and pull them down like this. So it's almost like I like the hands
},
{
    150.62,158.18
     supinated here also. Pulling those shoulders down just putting those
},
{
    158.18,168.0
     scapulae in your back pocket. Good pull themhhh. Feels good. Feel those little nooks and crannies in your low back
},
{
    168.0,171.0
     and in your mid back just working for you right now.
},
{
    171.0,173.0
     Shhhh.
},
{
    173.0,176.0
     Okay, what we're going to do now is we're going to do it single arm.
},
{
    176.0,179.0
     It's going to add a little brain shoulder connection.
},
{
    179.0,182.0
     A lot of shoulder rehabilitation is scapular stabilization.
},
{
    182.0,184.0
     Stabilization right here.
},
{
    184.0,185.52
     This is a great start for you.
},
{
    185.52,192.08
     So take, I'll take my left, you take your right, big breath in and pull it down.
},
{
    192.08,196.08
     Just the right one for you right now. Just pull it, pull it, feel it just dig. Feel it
},
{
    196.08,206.9
     scapulae, dig into your ribs. Good, big breath in and to your right, your left, pull it down, pull it, pull it, engage the abs, good, let's go to the other side.
},
{
    209.86,211.3
     Good, pull it down, pull it down,
},
{
    211.3,213.56
     pull it down, down, down, down, down, down.
},
{
    213.56,215.56
     Good, and the next one, pull it down.
},
{
    216.78,219.08
     We're not using any weights on this video.
},
{
    219.08,223.26
     This is just you, some isometric contractions,
},
{
    223.26,227.96
     some movement, but no weights. You can do this one
},
{
    227.96,235.16
     anywhere. Go in the woods and do it. Pull it down, pull that left one down, dig it in.
},
{
    235.16,238.92
     Good. Let's go the other side.
},
{
    243.76,247.68
     Palms facing me. There we go
},
{
    249.68,251.2
     And last one
},
{
    252.7,259.3
     Okay, we're gonna do Circles again, but you know palms up and we're gonna go 45 degrees out, right? This works the super spinatus muscle
},
{
    259.3,261.3
     We're just gonna do some arm circles again
},
{
    263.0,267.16
     Good perfect arm circles the abs are are engaged. The shoulders, just like
},
{
    267.16,270.02
     you just pulled them down, are going to be pulled down. Let's make them a little bit
},
{
    270.02,288.72
     bigger. Good. Now you feel a little more ab recruitment. Beautiful. Good. Let's go the other direction.
},
{
    288.72,290.6
     Get them a little fatigued.
},
{
    290.6,297.56
     Let's go right in the center now and let's zoom fast.
},
{
    297.56,298.56
     Feel the muscles work.
},
{
    298.56,301.16
     Again, if you can't do this, bring them down here.
},
{
    301.16,302.44
     Feel good about where you are.
},
{
    302.44,306.0
     You're just going to step it up a little bit by a little bit.
},
{
    306.0,315.0
     Your muscles have to take the job of the ligaments with the shoulder to really get it to work better to heal.
},
{
    315.0,319.0
     So then those ligaments and go the other direction can heal.
},
{
    319.0,328.76
     So really, shoulders, if anyone prays for patience, they get a shoulder injury because it takes some patience. You got to work at it. You got to keep working at it. Keep
},
{
    328.76,331.88
     working out. Otherwise people come to my house, well it's been four years this
},
{
    331.88,337.08
     thing keeps happening. Well you got to do these exercises regularly and then the
},
{
    337.08,341.96
     body can heal it. Can't just be a one or two time a week thing. Alright let's go.
},
{
    341.96,345.42
     We're going to do 90 degrees on your arms like this.
},
{
    346.56,349.36
     Palms up and we're gonna send.
},
{
    349.36,350.84
     We do external rotation of the arm
},
{
    350.84,353.44
     and push it out like this.
},
{
    353.44,357.6
     Push, push, push, push and bring it back to center.
},
{
    357.6,361.68
     Push it out, chest is up but the abs are engaged.
},
{
    361.68,363.44
     Pinch the shoulder blades.
},
{
    364.4,366.64
     Pinch it. Feel that pinch.
},
{
    366.64,371.36
     You're gonna work something called the rhomboid. I want somebody to hug you and
},
{
    371.36,389.12
     go, boy you got a strong back. This is great. Pinch it. Let's see the back. Pinch and bring it back. Pinch and bring it back. Good job you guys. Pinch and bring it back.
},
{
    389.12,393.72
     Pinch. Now we're going to do some pulses at the end. We're going to pulse, pulse.
},
{
    393.72,399.32
     Keep your elbows tight into the sides of your body. This is in here. It's more in
},
{
    399.32,408.4
     with the elbows to the tight sides of the body. Pinch it, pinch it, and pull the scapula down at the same time for 10, 9, 8.
},
{
    408.4,409.24
     Good job.
},
{
    414.84,415.88
     Great.
},
{
    415.88,418.2
     Palms up, we're gonna do some arm raises.
},
{
    418.2,420.44
     Arms up, come up like this.
},
{
    420.44,422.64
     Elbows pointing straight ahead.
},
{
    422.64,425.0
     Chest is up, abs engaged.
},
{
    425.0,428.0
     You're going to lift the arm with the hand still,
},
{
    428.0,431.0
     go a little wider stance, with the hand still facing back,
},
{
    431.0,433.0
     and then we're going to go to the other one.
},
{
    433.0,436.0
     And we're going to switch back and forth.
},
{
    436.0,438.0
     This is getting the anterior deltoid.
},
{
    438.0,440.0
     Nice deltoids.
},
{
    440.0,442.0
     Good.
},
{
    442.0,447.88
     It's also creating a little external rotation. External rotation is so good when
},
{
    447.88,458.6
     it comes to working out your shoulder. There we go. Keep going. Contract your triceps at
},
{
    458.6,466.16
     the top. We don't want flabby triceps. There we go.
},
{
    466.16,467.3
     Chest is up.
},
{
    467.3,468.64
     I'm feeling this.
},
{
    468.64,470.44
     I hope you are.
},
{
    470.44,472.48
     If not, this is no big deal.
},
{
    472.48,476.76
     Jump right to my four scapular stabilization videos
},
{
    476.76,478.8
     and start getting real serious.
},
{
    481.6,490.0
     Let's go for 10, 9, 8, 7, 3, 2, 1.
},
{
    490.0,492.28
     Alright, let's go back to the 90 degrees.
},
{
    492.28,494.48
     This time the palms facing you.
},
{
    494.48,496.32
     Chest is up, shoulders down.
},
{
    496.32,499.12
     Let's go wide stance on this one.
},
{
    499.12,504.48
     Just tack those elbows to the side of your body and pinch it.
},
{
    504.48,506.32
     Good. P pinch it. Good, pinch it.
},
{
    510.88,511.88
     You can do it.
},
{
    511.88,514.28
     You can get your shoulders strong.
},
{
    514.28,516.12
     It's happening right now as we speak.
},
{
    516.12,519.0
     You may even be able to be a little sore after this,
},
{
    519.0,521.12
     but you're gonna feel stronger.
},
{
    521.12,522.32
     You can do things.
},
{
    522.32,524.04
     You can lift things.
},
{
    524.04,524.88
     Gotta go mountain biking,
},
{
    524.88,527.0
     gotta carry that bike over a log.
},
{
    527.0,531.0
     You gotta swim. You gotta pick your kid up.
},
{
    531.0,535.0
     Let's do it. Let's do it with strength, power, confidence.
},
{
    535.0,538.0
     Turn your mental energy into physical energy.
},
{
    538.0,540.0
     There's a, I'm strong.
},
{
    540.0,543.0
     Every day. How you doing? I'm stronger.
},
{
    543.0,545.64
     I'm stronger every day. So he says, oh, how's that shoulder? I'm getting better every day. How you doing? I'm stronger. I'm stronger every day. So he says, oh how's
},
{
    545.64,550.28
     that shoulder? I'm getting better every day. I'm getting stronger every day. Nothing's
},
{
    550.28,557.6
     getting in my way. Let's do it. Come on now. Pulse it for 10. Push into that
},
{
    557.6,564.76
     end range motion. 4, 3, 2, feel the burn and 1. Alright let's hit the floor and
},
{
    564.76,567.4
     let's gather in some more strength to your shoulders.
},
{
    567.4,573.16
     So first we're going to start with your, on your hands and knees, just like this.
},
{
    573.16,574.16
     Okay.
},
{
    574.16,579.36
     Hands are, you know, have a nice, push your fingers a little bit into your mat.
},
{
    579.36,585.36
     Keep your elbows totally locked out and we're going to pinch your shoulder blades and then bring
},
{
    585.36,589.72
     them forward. The abs are engaged, you're pinching and you're bringing forward just
},
{
    589.72,593.72
     like this. Pinching, bring forward. We're going to do a little variation if you like,
},
{
    593.72,601.32
     if you can. The next level up is on your knees here, pinching forward like this or
},
{
    601.32,609.12
     if you're feeling very advanced today, you can come here and do a plank, pinching and forward.
},
{
    609.12,621.36
     Pinching forward like this. Good. Keep going. That scapula is regaining its range of motion. A lot
},
{
    621.36,626.64
     of us have scapular amnesia. All our scapula knows how to do is go up towards
},
{
    626.64,631.12
     the ears because we've been sitting at a computer or whatnot. We're going to learn how to bring
},
{
    631.12,638.32
     that scapula down and around and rotate it clockwise and counterclockwise. Everything but
},
{
    638.88,646.32
     we don't want up so pull it down a little bit. Good. now we're gonna do something I call the Iron Man.
},
{
    646.32,650.78
     We're gonna go on your belly, the chest is up,
},
{
    650.78,653.8
     the abs are engaged, the toes are pointed,
},
{
    653.8,656.56
     fingers are pointed, and bring those fingers
},
{
    656.56,659.94
     in to your sides, the palms are facing your body.
},
{
    659.94,662.76
     You're already gonna feel the shoulders just tighten up
},
{
    662.76,664.32
     and you're gonna feel them stabilize a bit,
},
{
    664.32,666.2
     pinch the shoulder blades together, and we're gonna feel him stabilize a bit. Pinch the shoulder blades together
},
{
    666.2,669.48
     and we're gonna come up, we're gonna fly like Iron Man.
},
{
    669.48,670.84
     I love Iron Man, he's so strong.
},
{
    670.84,672.96
     He says, I am Iron Man.
},
{
    672.96,675.08
     You know, you just tell yourself I am Iron Man,
},
{
    675.08,676.4
     I'm so strong.
},
{
    676.4,678.56
     You're gonna be shaking a little bit here now.
},
{
    678.56,680.64
     Let's just pulse the arms just a little bit up.
},
{
    680.64,683.54
     Pulse, pulse like this.
},
{
    683.54,684.36
     There it is.
},
{
    684.36,686.12
     Pulse, bring those hands in
},
{
    686.12,690.68
     close to you. Pull the shoulders down. I don't want your shoulders by your ears.
},
{
    690.68,696.24
     Engage the abs. Engage the glutes even. Straighten the toes. The toes are not off
},
{
    696.24,708.8
     the ground though. Doing good. Let's do 10 more of these. Pulse it, pulse it, pulse it.
},
{
    715.28,716.48
     Okay, next one we go from Iron Man to Aquaman. These are called swimmers. So
},
{
    722.24,725.6
     go face down, your arms are out, feet are out. We're just kind of with the breath, we're going to lift your left arm and your right leg and
},
{
    725.6,727.76
     just lift like that.
},
{
    727.76,731.36
     And then breathing out and coming up on the other side, lift.
},
{
    731.36,732.36
     Good.
},
{
    732.36,737.84
     Let's get your shoulder communicating with your hip.
},
{
    737.84,740.96
     It's almost like a cross crawl movement.
},
{
    740.96,742.88
     Crawling is very important by the way.
},
{
    742.88,745.8
     It helps with brain development.
},
{
    745.8,752.0
     Alright so let's, if you want to ramp this up a little bit, let's hover when we do it.
},
{
    752.0,758.72
     And let's come up and then don't return the leg or the arm back to the ground,
},
{
    758.72,763.76
     but keep it hovering. There you go. You'll feel this in your low back also, but I
},
{
    763.76,775.08
     really want you to fully load that shoulder. Fully bring it to its end range of motion. Good. And let's make
},
{
    775.08,789.16
     it a little faster and just pulse it. Pulse it. I love this one.
},
{
    789.16,794.28
     Since we're going with the superhero theme, I thought I'd call the next one Superman.
},
{
    794.28,803.32
     So let's go ahead and keep your feet on the ground, point the toes, bring your body up,
},
{
    803.32,807.4
     bring your arms to about right by your side.
},
{
    807.4,813.32
     And then what we're going to do is we're going to bring our arms out like Superman and straighten
},
{
    813.32,814.48
     them all the way.
},
{
    814.48,815.48
     Good.
},
{
    815.48,819.32
     And then big breath in and come up and then bring them out.
},
{
    819.32,827.0
     Now if this is a bit much, you can come down, come up, and bring them out.
},
{
    827.0,829.0
     Good.
},
{
    829.0,833.24
     Come down, bring them out.
},
{
    833.24,836.28
     Or if you want to stay hovering, just stay hovering.
},
{
    836.28,840.68
     But when you bring them out, you bring them back, pinch it, bring those elbows to your
},
{
    840.68,844.36
     side, and then bring them out in front of you.
},
{
    844.36,867.0
     Pinch it, bring your elbows to your side. Yeah, and this is beginner, come on. I's do five more.
},
{
    867.0,869.48
     Okay.
},
{
    869.48,872.0
     Okay.
},
{
    872.0,874.12
     Quick rest.
},
{
    874.12,882.28
     Move that body around.
},
{
    882.28,886.2
     Get the tension out of your mid back, and then we're going
},
{
    886.2,891.04
     to bring the hands like a W, like this.
},
{
    891.04,895.12
     And I call this one butterfly because we're going to flap our wings like a butterfly.
},
{
    895.12,896.12
     Okay?
},
{
    896.12,898.36
     And we're just going to bring them up.
},
{
    898.36,902.84
     You can leave your head down, which is fine, but keep those shoulders down towards your
},
{
    902.84,903.84
     hips.
},
{
    903.84,907.8
     Pinch, pinch, here we go.
},
{
    907.8,908.64
     Pinch.
},
{
    911.48,912.32
     Who would've thought?
},
{
    912.32,914.84
     No weight, and you're feeling it.
},
{
    932.5,936.52
     I love working shoulders. Some people might be coming up like this, leading with the elbows.
},
{
    936.52,937.52
     We don't want to do that.
},
{
    937.52,943.92
     We want to try and lead with your wrist, even if that diminishes the range of motion.
},
{
    943.92,944.92
     Lead with your wrist.
},
{
    944.92,947.76
     Make that highest to the ceiling.
},
{
    947.76,950.76
     Let's do it for five.
},
{
    950.76,951.76
     Good.
},
{
    951.76,961.16
     Let's go ahead and turn on our backs.
},
{
    961.16,968.68
     The next one is kind of a stretch meets exercise.
},
{
    968.68,970.92
     So this is just a butterfly.
},
{
    970.92,974.28
     We want to really loosen up the front of the body.
},
{
    974.28,977.88
     So the arm's going to be by your side.
},
{
    977.88,980.4
     Let's start with the legs flat.
},
{
    980.4,989.18
     And we're going to just go along the carpet or the floor, whatever you're using. And you'll feel a stretch in that biceps
},
{
    989.18,990.32
     coming all the way up.
},
{
    991.76,993.8
     Feel a chest stretch.
},
{
    993.8,995.72
     And when you can't go any longer,
},
{
    995.72,997.3
     see if I were to just go further,
},
{
    997.3,998.48
     I'd have to bring my arms up.
},
{
    998.48,1001.4
     I want them to stay on the ground.
},
{
    1001.4,1004.04
     And then let's bring them down.
},
{
    1004.04,1005.48
     Good.
},
{
    1005.48,1009.8
     Chest is up, but yet low back slightly pushed down
},
{
    1009.8,1011.08
     into the ground.
},
{
    1011.08,1013.48
     Fingers are wide, abs are engaged.
},
{
    1013.48,1015.56
     Feel the stretch in the biceps.
},
{
    1015.56,1017.8
     You can do this on a wall vertically also.
},
{
    1019.96,1021.96
     Just don't knock anything off the wall.
},
{
    1023.4,1026.1
     And you're gonna feel such a beautiful stretch here.
},
{
    1026.1,1027.96
     Feel that stretch, just raise it up,
},
{
    1027.96,1031.08
     push into that end range motion and bring it down.
},
{
    1032.6,1033.6
     Let's do a few more.
},
{
    1040.24,1053.48
     Good. All right.
},
{
    1053.48,1054.48
     Very good.
},
{
    1054.48,1057.36
     If you need more help, we're here for you.
},
{
    1057.36,1060.56
     Otherwise, you've already had a great day doing these exercises.
},
{
    1060.56,1062.24
     Now go enjoy the rest of it.
},
