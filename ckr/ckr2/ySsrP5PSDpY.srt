     Alright guys, in this next video we're gonna go over how to stabilize an impaled object.
},
{
    5.0,12.12
     Whether that object is a pen, a knife, wherever it is, and a limb, in an eye, Viri is gonna
},
{
    12.12,17.8
     pretend like she's not here, but she's holding our object in place.
},
{
    17.8,23.92
     So there's a pen in this guy's thigh right now, and Diane and Marshall are the EMTs.
},
{
    23.92,26.56
     And so initially when we come on scene, ABCs,
},
{
    26.56,28.48
     and we're gonna assess for DCAP-ETLS,
},
{
    28.48,30.44
     which can be found in another video
},
{
    30.44,33.16
     in the upper right hand corner right now.
},
{
    33.16,36.16
     And after DCAP-ETLS is assessed, no bleeding,
},
{
    36.16,37.44
     we're gonna go for PMS.
},
{
    37.44,39.4
     Marshall, can you demo PMS for us?
},
{
    39.4,42.04
     Yeah, so I'll be checking for PETAL pulse.
},
{
    42.04,43.44
     Okay, pulse is present.
},
{
    43.44,45.4
     Yep, and then check for motor sensation. What do we do? I'd ask him to push down on my hand like a pedal pulse. Okay, pulse is present. Yep, and then check for motor sensation
},
{
    45.4,51.06
     So what do we do? I'd ask him to push down my hand like a gas pedal great and then push up pull up
},
{
    51.06,53.46
     Okay, and then the last thing I'm checking for
},
{
    55.0,60.24
     Sensation so can you feel this Randy? Oh, and he says yes. Okay, perfect
},
{
    60.48,67.44
     And Diane is gonna assist Marshall in this so we're gonna use anything that allows us to stabilize the object about two-thirds
},
{
    67.44,69.04
     of the way up.
},
{
    69.04,71.88
     And so in this case, we just have four rolls of curl-axe.
},
{
    71.88,76.64
     And go ahead and support the pen.
},
{
    76.64,87.0
     And then Marshall is going to start rolling off the roll.
},
{
    87.0,127.0
     Very good. Once it's loose, you just tuck it in somewhere and then what's the last thing that we do?
},
{
    127.0,129.0
     Check the PMS again.
},
{
    129.0,131.0
     Awesome job guys. Thanks Marshall.
},
{
    131.0,134.0
     Diane and Maryse.
