    6.72,8.04
     on the internet.
},
{
    11.04,14.32
     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.
},
{
    14.32,15.64
     Brad Heineck, physical therapist.
},
{
    15.64,17.2
     Together we are the most famous physical therapists
},
{
    17.2,18.04
     on the internet.
},
{
    18.04,18.88
     In our opinion, of course, Bob.
},
{
    18.88,19.84
     Time to work, Brad.
},
{
    19.84,22.96
     Today we'll talk about the most important exercises
},
{
    22.96,27.08
     to help pinch, nerve, and neck pain fast relief.
},
{
    27.08,28.96
     This is an updated video, by the way.
},
{
    28.96,30.08
     We did this one before.
},
{
    30.08,32.6
     Yeah, but now we've got a nice new stretch in there.
},
{
    32.6,34.6
     We're gonna review it, look at it from a different look.
},
{
    34.6,36.52
     A little angled, the angle I'm talking about.
},
{
    36.52,37.8
     Yeah, the old one, by the way,
},
{
    37.8,40.24
     we got interrupted by some nursing home staff.
},
{
    40.24,41.08

     All right, and we got the podcast, Bob.
},
{
    74.44,75.44
     And we got the podcast.
},
{
    75.44,77.24
     Podcast is up and running.
},
{
    77.24,79.4
     You know, there's something I want to mention that
},
{
    79.4,84.92
     there's a couple complaints about our sign is getting beat up a little bit.
},
{
    84.92,85.0
     But you know, we like to get every last bit out of it. That's right. A couple complaints about our sign is getting feet up a little bit.
},
{
    85.0,87.2
     But you know, we like to get every last bit out of it.
},
{
    87.2,89.78
     So anyways, neck, pinched nerve,
},
{
    89.78,92.08
     we're talking about pinched nerve in the neck,
},
{
    92.08,93.36
     associated with neck pain,
},
{
    93.36,96.0
     but oftentimes as a result of that pinched nerve,
},
{
    96.0,99.0
     you can get referred pain into the shoulder blade,
},
{
    99.0,101.7
     which is really common, down the shoulder,
},
{
    101.7,104.16
     into the arm and all the way up to the fingers actually.
},
{
    104.16,105.6
     And if it's into the fingers,
},
{
    105.6,108.52
     it generally means you got a pinched nerve somewhere.
},
{
    108.52,110.52
     Right, exactly.
},
{
    110.52,114.4
     So what we need to do is kind of show you how this works
},
{
    114.4,115.68
     and why the nerve gets pinched.
},
{
    115.68,117.6
     So we're gonna use our friend Sam
},
{
    117.6,120.68
     and Gumby as his sidekick.
},
{
    120.68,122.44
     We're gonna look, what I do,
},
{
    122.44,124.76
     I have a nerve put in here
},
{
    124.76,126.18
     and we're going at a low level do, I have a nerve put in here and we're going on low level
},
{
    126.18,130.48
     because typically a pinched nerve happens at C6 or C7.
},
{
    130.48,131.32
     And that's cervical.
},
{
    131.32,132.68
     That's this bone or this bone.
},
{
    132.68,134.52
     Those cervical bones.
},
{
    134.52,137.52
     And then the nerves, here's the little nerves
},
{
    137.52,139.36
     coming out here.
},
{
    139.36,143.32
     And they're coming out of the frame and over the holes.
},
{
    143.32,148.48
     And they can get pinched there from bony overgrowth
},
{
    148.48,152.08
     or they can get pinched from the disc itself.
},
{
    152.08,155.08
     Right, so the nerves here are cut off.
},
{
    155.08,156.68
     So I put an extended one,
},
{
    156.68,159.28
     because this is the route that the nerves get down.
},
{
    159.28,161.96
     Actually, more than just one come off, they come out,
},
{
    161.96,164.4
     I believe there's three years at four that come together
},
{
    164.4,165.82
     and they form the brachial plexus,
},
{
    165.82,168.98
     but the route is the same underneath the clavicle.
},
{
    168.98,170.46
     It kind of goes through the axillary.
},
{
    170.46,171.78
     I don't know if you say collar bone?
},
{
    171.78,172.78
     Yep, under the collar bone.
},
{
    172.78,173.62
     Go through your armpit.
},
{
    173.62,175.46
     Yep, there, and then it goes down.
},
{
    175.46,178.9
     It starts the branch off down into the arm.
},
{
    178.9,182.32
     So what we're going to do is we need to unpinch it,
},
{
    182.32,184.3
     probably most of the time,
},
{
    184.3,187.12
     the nerve is pinched up in the neck,
},
{
    187.12,188.92
     in the cervical column.
},
{
    188.92,191.76
     It could possibly pinch be somewhere else,
},
{
    191.76,192.92
     possibly in the elbow.
},
{
    194.16,195.48
     But we're looking at this here
},
{
    195.48,197.44
     because the majority of the time that's where it is.
},
{
    197.44,199.76
     And you'll know just by some movement
},
{
    199.76,201.2
     of your neck typically.
},
{
    201.2,204.44
     So, any other questions with Sam?
},
{
    204.44,205.84
     No, I was just gonna say Brad,
},
{
    205.84,207.88
     so the first thing you really need to do
},
{
    207.88,209.88
     is we need to stop the cause.
},
{
    209.88,212.16
     Because if you do these exercises
},
{
    212.16,214.52
     and you haven't stopped what's causing it,
},
{
    214.52,216.0
     it's just gonna keep getting bad.
},
{
    216.0,217.6
     It's gonna keep getting worse.
},
{
    217.6,219.16
     So one of the causes?
},
{
    220.08,220.92
     Causes of what?
},
{
    220.92,223.24
     One of the causes is a head form posture.
},
{
    223.24,224.92
     I know, I had another thought though, Bob.
},
{
    224.92,225.76
     Oh, all right.
},
{
    225.76,227.28
     I just wanted to say one way you can confirm
},
{
    227.28,229.84
     it's in a low neck and this is what I do with
},
{
    229.84,233.48
     most of my patients is I have them set up
},
{
    233.48,235.8
     good and tall and straight in their chair.
},
{
    235.8,237.52
     I have them get their head over the ears
},
{
    237.52,240.16
     with a mild chin tuck and then I say,
},
{
    240.16,242.52
     can you look back like this really far?
},
{
    242.52,245.6
     And if they go back like that and it hurts,
},
{
    245.6,248.28
     I'm thinking, and I don't know what the percentage is,
},
{
    248.28,252.56
     but a high percentage, it's definitely in the neck.
},
{
    252.56,255.46
     We work the neck, we free the neck up,
},
{
    255.46,257.42
     things get better, the neck feels better,
},
{
    257.42,259.16
     down the arm goes better.
},
{
    259.16,261.92
     That's the majority of cases in my experience.
},
{
    261.92,264.52
     Yeah, really, if we treat the neck and it gets better,
},
{
    264.52,266.28
     obviously it was in the neck. Yeah, really, if we treat the neck and it gets better, obviously it was in the neck.
},
{
    266.28,267.12
     Right, so.
},
{
    267.12,268.02
     Exactly.
},
{
    268.02,272.04
     So yeah, posture, posture, posture, posture,
},
{
    272.04,274.48
     the three big things in our society
},
{
    274.48,277.6
     that causes poor head and neck posture,
},
{
    277.6,279.72
     which can create a pinched nerve,
},
{
    279.72,282.12
     is looking at your cell phone.
},
{
    282.12,284.04
     Yep, looking down like this.
},
{
    284.04,284.88
     Yep.
},
{
    284.88,287.64
     And, you know, moving the head forward.
},
{
    287.64,289.12
     Yep.
},
{
    289.12,291.3
     Driving a car, same thing.
},
{
    291.3,293.44
     People that have their head over their steering wheel,
},
{
    293.44,295.52
     I'm exaggerating a little bit, but you know what I mean.
},
{
    295.52,298.96
     Well, one thing, if they have the seat leaning back too far,
},
{
    298.96,301.6
     it causes you to move your head forward like that.
},
{
    301.6,303.36
     So that's why I want the seat upright
},
{
    303.36,306.24
     so you're in good posture. Exactly.
},
{
    306.24,310.8
     Sitting at a desk, computers, a little laptop.
},
{
    310.8,312.16
     Especially the laptops.
},
{
    312.16,314.8
     Because you're gonna go down like this.
},
{
    314.8,316.64
     We gotta get those screens raised up.
},
{
    316.64,318.16
     You gotta get the screens raised up,
},
{
    318.16,319.96
     get your chair positioned properly.
},
{
    319.96,321.56
     We've got videos on that as well.
},
{
    321.56,324.12
     We're not gonna go into detail, but posture is big.
},
{
    324.12,328.12
     So adjust your posture, make sure you're sitting up tall,
},
{
    328.12,330.88
     head over your ears if you will.
},
{
    330.88,332.0
     We like chin tucks.
},
{
    332.0,332.84
     Yep.
},
{
    332.84,334.52
     I mean, that'll be part of the exercise program.
},
{
    334.52,336.16
     As a matter of fact, we throw it in right now
},
{
    336.16,338.24
     because then we're gonna show exercises.
},
{
    338.24,341.6
     While you're sitting at your desk in your car.
},
{
    341.6,343.2
     It's a great correction exercise.
},
{
    343.2,344.24
     Do chin tucks.
},
{
    344.24,346.6
     Yep. Chin goes in towards your throat,
},
{
    346.6,348.4
     not down like this, but.
},
{
    348.4,349.32
     Or not up.
},
{
    349.32,350.16
     Right.
},
{
    350.16,351.76
     It's a reminder to you,
},
{
    351.76,355.12
     not only does it does the job of moving your head back,
},
{
    355.12,357.48
     but it's a reminder where your head should be positioned.
},
{
    357.48,358.32
     Right.
},
{
    358.32,359.92
     I've had a number of patients, I say,
},
{
    359.92,361.44
     can you do a chin tuck?
},
{
    361.44,362.96
     And they got the pinched nerve.
},
{
    362.96,365.6
     And even that will start to irritate it.
},
{
    365.6,367.6
     And it's like, so then we have to work into that gently
},
{
    367.6,368.44
     but we work with the-
},
{
    368.44,370.72
     Or even do a lined on on your back.
},
{
    370.72,371.56
     Right.
},
{
    371.56,372.4
     Just work on it.
},
{
    372.4,373.76
     With the towel behind your head.
},
{
    373.76,375.12
     Exactly.
},
{
    375.12,379.0
     So we're gonna start with the chin tucks and good posture.
},
{
    379.0,382.4
     Another exercise to,
},
{
    382.4,383.8
     so you know you've got good posture,
},
{
    383.8,386.38
     can you swing over this way, Mike?
},
{
    386.38,389.66
     As we use our friend, the wall.
},
{
    389.66,392.54
     And make sure you put your butt up against the wall.
},
{
    392.54,394.1
     This is the way I teach it.
},
{
    394.1,395.66
     And then your shoulder blades.
},
{
    395.66,399.2
     And then if you can get your shoulders back like this,
},
{
    399.2,401.02
     as opposed to forward.
},
{
    401.02,402.38
     So we'll get the shoulders back.
},
{
    402.38,403.62
     Now we've got good posture,
},
{
    403.62,405.48
     but then the last critical thing
},
{
    405.48,409.48
     is can you get your head to touch the wall there
},
{
    409.48,411.24
     with a little bit of a chin tuck?
},
{
    411.24,414.12
     That might be difficult at first with this pinched nerve,
},
{
    414.12,416.32
     but we're gonna show you a trick to get out of it.
},
{
    416.32,420.44
     And then from there, do the famous W's.
},
{
    420.44,422.56
     Now you can do this without the wall,
},
{
    422.56,424.92
     but the wall lets you know for sure
},
{
    424.92,426.56
     if you've got that good posture
},
{
    426.56,429.08
     because you touch your elbows in your hands
},
{
    429.08,431.92
     and you can work wall angels up and down.
},
{
    431.92,434.48
     It depends on how tight your shoulders are
},
{
    434.48,436.44
     and just do some repetitions like this,
},
{
    436.44,440.0
     five to 10 repetitions and do that throughout the day.
},
{
    440.0,441.84
     And why we do wall angels
},
{
    441.84,444.24
     and why we do this next one is because
},
{
    444.24,446.44
     if you are rounded out
},
{
    446.44,450.08
     in this position right up here in the upper back,
},
{
    450.08,451.44
     that if you're rounded out there,
},
{
    451.44,453.32
     there's no way you can straighten your neck out.
},
{
    453.32,455.32
     I mean, it's gonna affect your neck.
},
{
    455.32,458.84
     So we gotta get that all stretched out to
},
{
    458.84,462.6
     the wall angels do it, do it, a foam roller does it.
},
{
    462.6,465.44
     Do you wanna go lengthwise or do you want to go roll it?
},
{
    465.44,466.56
     Well, we could do both.
},
{
    466.56,468.84
     If they got a roller, they might as well do both.
},
{
    468.84,473.84
     So the one is you just, you can just work on the upper back.
},
{
    474.06,475.94
     And a lot of times if you fold your arms,
},
{
    475.94,478.6
     you can really get between the shoulder blades as well.
},
{
    478.6,482.08
     And you can just work on that area and stretch it out.
},
{
    482.08,484.24
     If you're doing a roller, don't do it on your bed.
},
{
    484.24,485.76
     You can see on this soft cushion,
},
{
    485.76,486.84
     it doesn't work well.
},
{
    486.84,488.68
     You know, on the floor works a lot better.
},
{
    488.68,490.0
     With the exception of this next one,
},
{
    490.0,490.84
     you could do this on the bed.
},
{
    490.84,492.18
     I'm gonna let you do this one, Brad.
},
{
    492.18,494.44
     I never get on that thing well.
},
{
    494.44,497.28
     So then you turn, if you got a three foot foam roller,
},
{
    497.28,500.36
     you turn it this way, right down your spine,
},
{
    500.36,502.56
     especially if you got the one that the lower density,
},
{
    502.56,504.28
     it's more comfortable.
},
{
    504.28,505.56
     And then you get your chin.
},
{
    505.56,507.06
     Now this is just like doing a chin tuck.
},
{
    507.06,509.88
     As a matter of fact, you can do baby chin tucks
},
{
    509.88,511.52
     while you're just relaxed.
},
{
    511.52,514.88
     And you're gonna relax for five or 10 minutes.
},
{
    514.88,516.88
     And straighten out your entire posture here.
},
{
    516.88,519.28
     It's straightening out that upper back, lower back,
},
{
    519.28,521.2
     and it's stretching out your pecs.
},
{
    521.2,522.04
     Exactly.
},
{
    522.04,525.4
     So it's an easy one to do in a relaxed position.
},
{
    525.4,527.4
     Your head might not be able to get all the way back
},
{
    527.4,530.84
     to start off, you might not use a rolled towel or something.
},
{
    530.84,532.16
     But, yeah.
},
{
    532.16,534.28
     If it doesn't go back, you could put a,
},
{
    534.28,536.32
     yeah, a rolled towel or folded up towel.
},
{
    536.32,538.84
     They make this device as well.
},
{
    538.84,541.76
     But you want to get rid of that and get your head down.
},
{
    541.76,544.96
     That's going to help free up that pinched nerve as well.
},
{
    546.08,548.6
     One last thing Brad, real quickly,
},
{
    548.6,551.48
     works for my patients a lot is if you're having pain down,
},
{
    551.48,554.44
     let's say the right arm, just whenever possible,
},
{
    554.44,556.0
     put your arm up on a pillow.
},
{
    556.0,558.84
     Because if the arm is being hung like this,
},
{
    558.84,560.6
     it's gonna pull your shoulder forward.
},
{
    560.6,562.76
     It's gonna put more stress on that nerve.
},
{
    562.76,566.22
     This is just a great way to start getting good posture
},
{
    566.22,567.62
     and taking stress off the nerve.
},
{
    567.62,568.94
     Sure, sure.
},
{
    568.94,572.46
     Should we show that the new exercise by Stuart McGill?
},
{
    572.46,573.98
     Sure, this is a,
},
{
    573.98,577.3
     we're just strengthening the neck without putting stress on it.
},
{
    577.3,579.62
     So you're gonna be in good posture.
},
{
    579.62,582.74
     I want you to put your tongue behind your teeth,
},
{
    582.74,584.1
     front of your teeth, right?
},
{
    584.1,584.94
     Okay.
},
{
    584.94,588.28
     And then you squeeze and tighten up the muscles
},
{
    588.28,589.26
     here in the neck.
},
{
    589.26,590.1
     And the front of the neck.
},
{
    590.1,591.48
     Yup, in the front of the neck.
},
{
    591.48,593.32
     Then you're gonna take your hands,
},
{
    593.32,594.84
     your two fists here,
},
{
    594.84,595.84
     and you're gonna,
},
{
    595.84,597.44
     if I wasn't holding it,
},
{
    597.44,599.48
     I would actually be pushing the neck up.
},
{
    599.48,601.04
     Okay, so it's like an isometric?
},
{
    601.04,602.68
     Yeah, it's isometric.
},
{
    602.68,607.52
     One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.
},
{
    607.52,609.44
     So we could do 10 of those.
},
{
    609.44,612.88
     Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.
},
{
    612.88,616.64
     What it does, it strengthens the correct muscles
},
{
    616.64,620.32
     without putting shear force on the bones.
},
{
    620.32,623.6
     So it's a comfortable way to strengthen,
},
{
    623.6,625.16
     is what I'm trying to say.
},
{
    625.16,626.72
     And that should help posture.
},
{
    626.72,628.48
     It's just gonna take pressure off that nerve.
},
{
    628.48,631.12
     It's strengthening the deep flexors which get weak
},
{
    631.12,634.08
     because you're strengthening the extensor
},
{
    634.08,635.92
     when you're dead for it.
},
{
    635.92,636.76
     Yeah.
},
{
    636.76,637.6
     Bad posture.
},
{
    637.6,639.68
     And now the other exercise.
},
{
    639.68,640.52
     What happened to all my...
},
{
    640.52,641.48
     Right here, sorry Brad.
},
{
    641.48,645.08
     Oh, I wonder, you can take a towel roll.
},
{
    645.08,648.72
     And what we're gonna do, I got a towel rolled up.
},
{
    648.72,651.26
     This is how a lot of times I have patients start.
},
{
    651.26,653.96
     As I mentioned earlier in the video,
},
{
    653.96,656.68
     if you can't go back like this and it hurts.
},
{
    656.68,658.68
     This is a McKenzie exercise by the way.
},
{
    658.68,660.44
     Robin McKenzie developed it.
},
{
    660.44,664.0
     You take a towel roll and go back in your chair,
},
{
    664.0,665.68
     good posture. And gently go back in your chair, good posture.
},
{
    665.68,668.36
     And gently go back like this.
},
{
    668.36,669.56
     And oftentimes I say,
},
{
    669.56,671.64
     oh, that support there feels better.
},
{
    671.64,673.32
     And I can go back farther.
},
{
    673.32,676.24
     And then you gently work that,
},
{
    676.24,678.8
     you know, five, maybe 10 repetitions.
},
{
    678.8,680.08
     Then you gotta take a break
},
{
    680.08,682.64
     and then come back at it in an hour or so.
},
{
    682.64,685.72
     If your arm in your hand is feeling better,
},
{
    685.72,687.4
     it's a really good sign.
},
{
    687.4,689.98
     If you start to do this and it starts to hurt
},
{
    689.98,691.88
     worst start on the arm, that means you're pinching
},
{
    691.88,693.3
     the nerve a little bit harder
},
{
    693.3,695.76
     and then you have to go to the next option.
},
{
    695.76,698.2
     Now, Brad was saying that the towel
},
{
    698.2,699.84
     helps better than no towel.
},
{
    699.84,700.68
     Right.
},
{
    700.68,704.24
     If you just try these, if you can do these without the towel,
},
{
    704.24,706.2
     do them with the towel, out the towel.
},
{
    706.2,708.28
     I've had people that have success just by putting
},
{
    708.28,710.72
     their hands back with your fingers down.
},
{
    710.72,711.68
     Give it some support.
},
{
    711.68,713.08
     Low on the neck.
},
{
    713.08,715.12
     And then you don't even have to use that towel
},
{
    715.12,717.64
     and you get similar results.
},
{
    717.64,720.76
     And that depends on the situation and the individual.
},
{
    720.76,725.0
     You can use what can work well is just the edge of a towel.
},
{
    725.22,729.32
     So instead of a thick towel, we get more specific.
},
{
    729.32,730.16
     The salvage.
},
{
    730.16,732.56
     Yep, the edge of the towel or the salvage.
},
{
    732.56,737.04
     I'm gonna get it low on the neck and kinda adjust it.
},
{
    737.04,739.76
     And yeah, that's the advantage of using the salvage
},
{
    739.76,744.0
     is you can really get focused in on one area of the spine.
},
{
    744.0,745.96
     Right where that nerve is.
},
{
    745.96,748.8
     It will do the same thing and we can roll up and pull up.
},
{
    748.8,750.62
     Pull up towards the eyes.
},
{
    751.92,752.84
     If you want to.
},
{
    752.84,756.08
     I've had people do it this way and this way
},
{
    756.08,758.68
     in whichever way works better, feels better,
},
{
    758.68,759.52
     it gives you more range.
},
{
    759.52,763.28
     Often I might recommend is grabbing it with one hand.
},
{
    763.28,765.0
     Like if you have a painful arm, grab with a non-painful arm and it with one hand. Like if you have a painful arm,
},
{
    765.0,768.8
     grab with a non-painful arm and just do one hand.
},
{
    768.8,771.04
     Because it's just gonna be more comfortable.
},
{
    771.04,774.28
     Yeah, cause with the injured, the arm that's sore,
},
{
    774.28,777.52
     it can even irritate it so you can relax it, put a pillow.
},
{
    777.52,778.68
     Now the thing about this,
},
{
    778.68,780.24
     you can do these throughout the day.
},
{
    780.24,782.2
     You don't just do them once and say,
},
{
    782.2,784.04
     oh, I'm done, I did what Bob and Brad said.
},
{
    784.04,786.68
     No, you do it like every hour if you can.
},
{
    786.68,789.28
     And that's how you're gonna get some relief.
},
{
    789.28,791.4
     You know, you're gonna get the benefit of it.
},
{
    791.4,793.84
     As long as the symptoms are getting better out of the arm
},
{
    793.84,796.24
     or moving from the shoulder up to the neck.
},
{
    796.24,797.92
     And you don't have to do it forever.
},
{
    797.92,799.32
     You're only gonna do that for,
},
{
    799.32,802.52
     usually I've had patients do that within a couple of days.
},
{
    802.52,803.92
     They start seeing some relief.
},
{
    803.92,805.6
     Right. And then they're motivated.
},
{
    805.6,807.72
     Right, and then the maintenance exercises,
},
{
    807.72,811.6
     usually posture, the posture exercises, and chin tucks.
},
{
    811.6,812.44
     Yeah.
},
{
    812.44,814.36
     By the way, Brad, you can also use the strap.
},
{
    814.36,815.92
     Yeah, if you have one of these,
},
{
    815.92,817.12
     these work really well.
},
{
    817.12,817.96
     Those work really well.
},
{
    817.96,822.84
     Particularly if you have arthritic hands
},
{
    822.84,824.16
     or you don't have good grip,
},
{
    824.16,826.94
     because you can go like this in the loops.
},
{
    826.94,830.14
     But they just, they can hit right on a spot.
},
{
    830.14,833.62
     You can get specific and then again, not gripping
},
{
    833.62,837.58
     but I'm using my hands and it does really work well.
},
{
    837.58,840.38
     And of course you can use these for a lot of other stretches
},
{
    840.38,842.94
     and whatnot to stretch out strap.
},
{
    842.94,844.22
     They're not very expensive either,
},
{
    844.22,846.64
     but I wouldn't buy it just for this.
},
{
    846.64,847.48
     Just for this.
},
{
    847.48,848.7
     If you got it laying around.
},
{
    848.7,849.98
     Give the towel a try.
},
{
    849.98,851.98
     So thanks for watching folks.
},
{
    851.98,None
     Good luck. you
},
