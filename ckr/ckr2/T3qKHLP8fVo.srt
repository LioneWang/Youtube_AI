     Bob and Brad, the two most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    9.56,13.76
     Hey lucky folks out there, I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist, Brad Heineck physical therapist
},
{
    13.76,17.32
     Together we are the most famous physical therapists on the internet and our opinion of course today Brad
},
{
    17.32,24.62
     We got five proven exercises proven in the sense that we've used them and they've worked right for knee osteoarthritis or knee pain
},
{
    25.52,30.88
     these are things that are easy to do and five things that you can try and you want to implement
},
{
    30.88,37.2
     them right now. Yes, well wait till you see the video first. Okay, so osteoarthritis just means
},
{
    37.2,43.2
     typical arthritis that you get wearing down of the joint and quite often sometimes little pieces
},
{
    43.2,46.2
     can break off and get in the wrong spot.
},
{
    46.2,50.08
     And also, and that's why this first one often comes in handy.
},
{
    50.08,51.08
     Sure.
},
{
    51.08,54.88
     All right, this is a Mulligan technique, Brian Mulligan again from New Zealand.
},
{
    54.88,59.76
     And what he does, you go ahead and this is the painful knee.
},
{
    59.76,64.2
     This one actually works sometimes Brad with people who have even a little bit of cartilage
},
{
    64.2,67.6
     problems. Sure. I had a nurse do this and she had great luck with it
},
{
    67.6,70.4
     Okay, so what you're gonna do is you're gonna put the leg up and
},
{
    71.08,75.56
     You're gonna actually grab on to the lower leg and you're gonna turn it in
},
{
    76.48,82.6
     Turn it this way so so the idea is we want to get that tibia bone to rotate
},
{
    82.6,90.38
     But the problem is you have skin around it and flesh. So you got to really grab deep. The whole idea here is that when you bend
},
{
    90.38,97.86
     your knee, Brad, believe it or not, when you bend your knee, this bone right here
},
{
    97.86,102.82
     turns. Sure. People don't know that, they think it just is like a hinge, but no,
},
{
    102.82,108.6
     this bone actually turns like this. The natural mechanics of it. So if you help it turn it's gonna go
},
{
    108.6,112.68
     a little bit further and if there's a problem within the joint sometimes that
},
{
    112.68,117.16
     helps it smooth out or it settles it maybe moves a little piece out of the
},
{
    117.16,122.36
     way. So again this is for someone that's pretty high level you have good balance
},
{
    122.36,128.08
     your mobility is good but you have knee pain. That's a good point Brad yeah, I don't want you putting your foot up here then falling over and then
},
{
    129.08,131.24
     Right so
},
{
    131.24,135.24
     You want to make sure you have you have the balance to do this you're gonna put your leg up again?
},
{
    135.24,139.98
     I'm grabbing with both hands, and I'm turning this leg right here. I'm grabbing pretty deep
},
{
    140.2,142.88
     I'm turning and while I'm turning I'm gonna go ahead and bend
},
{
    144.48,148.36
     And you're only gonna do this you'll know look at that crack Wow
},
{
    149.28,153.4
     When you do this it's gonna move farther and with less pain
},
{
    154.28,156.88
     The opposite happens and it starts to hurt more
},
{
    157.88,162.32
     Exactly. This is a pain-free technique. You should be pain-free right?
},
{
    162.32,164.64
     It does not work for everyone as a matter of fact
},
{
    164.64,168.96
     There's only a certain percentage of people it will work for. But when it works, it works well.
},
{
    169.52,176.64
     Yep. So you're trying to get more knee bend if you can. You know, especially if you have limited knee
},
{
    176.64,182.24
     bend. If you look at one knee, if you lay down, Brad, can you mind if I lay down? Go ahead. And if I
},
{
    182.24,185.24
     bend one knee and it goes all the way back like this,
},
{
    185.24,187.52
     and I bend the other knee and it only goes this far,
},
{
    187.52,188.84
     that's the arthritic knee,
},
{
    188.84,190.56
     this might be a good technique for it.
},
{
    190.56,191.88
     Yep.
},
{
    191.88,192.96
     All right.
},
{
    192.96,194.48
     The opposite is also true.
},
{
    194.48,196.12
     If your knees,
},
{
    197.4,200.76
     if you put your legs up on a stool or a chair,
},
{
    200.76,203.16
     and one knee goes all the way down,
},
{
    203.16,205.82
     the other knee stays bent and that's the
},
{
    205.82,210.28
     arthritic knee, you're gonna want to regain that motion. Right, if possible.
},
{
    210.28,215.84
     They have found that even a slight gain in motion will decrease the knee pain in
},
{
    215.84,220.96
     that leg and I have found this to be completely true Brad, we've had great
},
{
    220.96,225.58
     success with this. Right and this is a whole concept that Mackenzie has.
},
{
    225.58,229.66
     Yeah this is a Mackenzie concept. So you're gonna want to get this knee
},
{
    229.66,232.86
     straighter again. So what you're gonna do is gonna go ahead and put it up on a
},
{
    232.86,239.14
     stool. Let's put it up on maybe that one. Yep that's a better stool. You can see it.
},
{
    239.14,243.38
     There we go. So you're gonna put your foot up on the stool the one that's giving you
},
{
    243.38,245.48
     trouble and it's very simple. All you're gonna do is foot up on the stool the one that's giving you trouble and it's very simple
},
{
    245.48,247.8
     All you're gonna do is push down you can push down here and here
},
{
    248.44,254.44
     Not on the kneecap not on the kneecap and you're gonna do what we call pressure on pressure off pressure on
},
{
    255.68,257.68
     pressure off and
},
{
    257.68,263.52
     By actually saying the words that tells you how long to do it right you don't have to time it so yeah pressure on
},
{
    264.24,265.48
     Pressure off and I don't have to time it. So yeah, pressure on, pressure off and
},
{
    265.48,271.36
     I don't know if I mentioned on the other one you should do it ten times and you can do it twice in a row if you want
},
{
    271.46,275.78
     But I'd only do it once a day and this one you can do throughout the day. Sure
},
{
    276.28,280.8
     And one point I want to bring up Bob is when you do this you say the first one it hurts
},
{
    280.8,285.82
     It doesn't hurt feel good, but by the second or third one the pain should start to decrease
},
{
    285.82,290.42
     Right and the range of motion should increase a little bit over time, right?
},
{
    290.42,294.36
     If you push it it hurts and by the fourth or fifth one it just hurts more and more
},
{
    295.08,300.96
     Then just stop, then back off a little bit too, maybe don't push as hard or back off to the next day
},
{
    300.96,302.52
     I had one guy do this
},
{
    302.52,310.16
     I gotta tell you though and he went a little crazy on it and he got really sore the first day and ended up working for him, but he was
},
{
    310.16,314.96
     kind of upset with me the first day that it had gotten so sore because, but I didn't expect
},
{
    314.96,319.6
     him to go home and do it every 10 minutes, you know. So the first day I would only do
},
{
    319.6,325.84
     one set of 10 and then next day see how it, know fared and then maybe do two sets of 10.
},
{
    325.84,334.52
     So you got all that Brad? Yeah so these you only do is it responds well day to day. I know what you
},
{
    334.52,339.92
     mean some people say if 10 is good a hundred is better right but don't you're spreading the
},
{
    339.92,344.44
     forces out over the joint. If you don't have the joint if it's not moving as much as it should be
},
{
    344.44,346.56
     it's just rubbing on one little spot instead of spreading the forces out. Right joint. If you don't have the joint, if it's not moving as much as it should be, it's just rubbing on one little spot
},
{
    346.56,348.72
     instead of spreading the forces out.
},
{
    348.72,350.1
     All right, in addition to that,
},
{
    350.1,352.08
     you're gonna wanna do some strengthening to the knees.
},
{
    352.08,354.24
     So those two are for the motion.
},
{
    354.24,356.36
     And so now we wanna start some strengthening.
},
{
    356.36,359.28
     So a good one to do is just a straight leg raise, Brad.
},
{
    359.28,363.4
     And in theory, you wanna get the motion as much as you can
},
{
    363.4,365.4
     and then go to the strength. To me, the best gain you're gonna get is get the motion as much as you can and then go to the strength right to me
},
{
    365.4,369.04
     The best gain you're gonna get is from the motion sure
},
{
    369.04,375.4
     That's that's what's gonna help you decrease the pain the most but over time the strength will help you sure so a
},
{
    375.6,377.8
     Straight leg raise Brad you can do it a lot of different ways
},
{
    378.0,380.84
     You can just go ahead and sit up like this and I'm gonna strengthen this one
},
{
    380.84,386.52
     I'm just gonna go ahead and lift up like this one One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.
},
{
    386.52,387.36
     Do it again.
},
{
    387.36,388.68
     I wanna point out a small thing.
},
{
    388.68,389.52
     One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.
},
{
    389.52,391.4
     When you do this, you can extend the knee all the way
},
{
    391.4,393.92
     to get those quadriceps kicking in.
},
{
    393.92,395.52
     See, I didn't even know I was doing that.
},
{
    395.52,396.84
     Yeah, little things like that makes a difference.
},
{
    396.84,398.28
     Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
},
{
    398.28,399.12
     it is harder.
},
{
    399.12,401.32
     Harder, now one more little thing, Bob.
},
{
    401.32,402.76
     Do that and pull your toes up.
},
{
    402.76,407.92
     One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. It's harder. These are the little things that
},
{
    407.92,414.4
     you can lay down and do it this way a little easier to start off with. You can turn it a little bit
},
{
    414.4,420.32
     maybe get a little more of the VMO right? You bet. This is one of the the classic things that a
},
{
    420.32,425.56
     surgeon will say the person cannot walk take their brace off until they can do a straight leg
},
{
    425.56,432.84
     raise and keep it locked out. Good set of ten and hold for ten or ten second or ten account of ten.
},
{
    432.84,439.16
     Right. And you can do the three ways but I don't know that let's not even do that huh Brad. No
},
{
    439.16,444.48
     let's keep it. Let's keep the quad. There's a lot of options here but we're gonna stick with some
},
{
    444.48,445.8
     basic ones that work.
},
{
    445.8,447.48
     All right, how about the next one, Brad?
},
{
    447.48,449.28
     Why don't we show a hamstring strength in any one
},
{
    449.28,450.12
     that you can do?
},
{
    450.12,450.96
     You wanna do that one?
},
{
    450.96,452.8
     I'll just put you up on a chair here.
},
{
    452.8,454.84
     Now, this is for people that,
},
{
    454.84,457.56
     if your mobility is good where you can go down
},
{
    457.56,461.88
     to a carpeted floor and you can go up to a piece of furniture,
},
{
    463.0,464.24
     some people can get down on the floor,
},
{
    464.24,466.44
     but they can't get back up with knee pain.
},
{
    466.44,468.88
     So if you got that problem, this is not for you.
},
{
    468.88,471.68
     This is for the people who are mobile and awesome.
},
{
    471.68,473.68
     This is just a great hamstring one.
},
{
    474.64,476.6
     The hamstrings are on the back of the leg.
},
{
    476.6,479.84
     They connect from the knee down to the pelvis.
},
{
    479.84,480.96
     It's your tuberosity.
},
{
    480.96,483.08
     You don't need to know that.
},
{
    483.08,487.48
     But what we're gonna do is I'm gonna think about pushing my heels straight down into the chair.
},
{
    487.48,490.6
     Yeah, I'm going to push down and my lift my butt up a little bit.
},
{
    490.6,496.16
     You could start out with isometrics and just push, hold it for eight to ten seconds,
},
{
    496.76,499.96
     and relax, and you will feel it right in here.
},
{
    499.96,504.8
     And you know you do ten reps of that. And again with arthritis, you want to make sure you're not having pain.
},
{
    504.8,505.4
     Right, so you're not having pain, right?
},
{
    505.4,512.0
     So you should with this and then you can start to pick up a little higher and you can get some hip involvement
},
{
    512.0,514.5
     if you scoot yourself away a little bit and
},
{
    515.52,521.92
     Work here you're gonna get both hamstrings and you're gonna get a little hip motion in there and that's all good for you
},
{
    521.92,527.2
     Yep, that's all part of the walking phase there all these joints and muscles work together when you're walking
},
{
    531.44,533.78
     There is an option one thing I do Bob
},
{
    534.4,539.46
     Probably more than you do as I'll do kind of like on and off
},
{
    539.92,546.36
     As opposed to the hold for 10 seconds, but that's an individual preference. I think yeah depending on the person
},
{
    546.76,550.82
     All right, the last one that you're gonna do is this very simple shallow squats
},
{
    553.0,556.3
     These you know these are good for you a great one for the knee
},
{
    556.3,560.76
     But most often people can't go down very far before they start running into pain
},
{
    560.76,564.24
     Yep, but you most people can do a version of these
},
{
    564.24,564.64
     Sure
},
{
    564.64,565.58
     So you can do it from hanging on version of these. So you can do it
},
{
    565.58,568.58
     from hanging on the chair or you can do it in front of the chair if you want
},
{
    568.58,574.04
     like this and you're just going to squat down slight and come back up again. I
},
{
    574.04,577.62
     know that doesn't seem like much but it actually is a great knee
},
{
    577.62,581.56
     strengthener and you're trying to stop the knee from going past the
},
{
    581.56,584.92
     foot, right Brad? You want to show that with a...
},
{
    584.92,585.28
     Again if balance is a problem make sure you have something to hold on in Stop the knee from going past the foot right Brad right you want to show that with
},
{
    589.88,595.32
     Again if balance is a problem make sure you have something to hold on in front So when I'm going down I don't want to see this the knee going way past the foot right puts a lot more pressure
},
{
    595.32,597.32
     I'm going to go right about to there
},
{
    597.8,603.48
     You can even do a little bit lunges like this to Brad you can do shallow lunges where you just kind of go like this
},
{
    612.4,618.76
     And that's where yeah yeah that's where a chair helps out really a lot is it? Right. Like this. Yep you can put a chair there if you have a cane you can put a chair in one hand
},
{
    618.76,627.34
     cane in the other anything to keep your stability. All those are nice functional strengthening activities
},
{
    627.34,629.42
     and they'll work well.
},
{
    629.42,630.74
     All right Brad, what say you?
},
{
    630.74,631.82
     I stole your line.
},
{
    631.82,635.86
     All right, Bob, I say that we can fix just about anything
},
{
    635.86,638.66
     except for this broken heart.
},
{
    638.66,639.5
     Right there.
},
{
    639.5,642.18
     Darn it, it's just been evading us.
},
{
    642.18,644.98
     Yeah, but I got some big ideas for 2017 on this.
},
{
    644.98,647.36
     It's just gonna break the boat.
},
{
    647.36,648.72
     Guys can't wait, can ya?
},
{
    648.72,649.8
     Thanks for watching.
},
