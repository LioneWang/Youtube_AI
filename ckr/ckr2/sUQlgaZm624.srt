     In this video I'm going to show the absolute best movement to take pressure off a pinch

     nerve in the lower back.
},
{
    5.84,9.56
     Hey everyone, Dr. Roe here at SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan.
},
{
    9.56,14.16
     I see patients on a daily basis with pinch nerves due to bulging discs and herniated
},
{
    14.16,15.16
     discs.
},
{
    15.16,19.38
     And these exercises I'm going to show you have helped a lot of them find quick relief.
},
{
    19.38,25.16
     With a herniated disc in the lower back, we need to focus on extension or backward movement. This
},
{
    25.16,29.52
     movement is important since it helps bring bulging material back inside the
},
{
    29.52,34.16
     disc and off-pinch nerves. The goal of these stretches is not only to decrease
},
{
    34.16,39.32
     pain levels but also to get what we call centralization of nerve pain. That is a
},
{
    39.32,42.96
     way of saying that if you put pressure on a nerve it will cause it to travel
},
{
    42.96,45.3
     such as a shooting sciatica pain down the leg. If you relieve pressure on a nerve, it will cause it to travel such as a shooting sciatica pain
},
{
    45.3,46.3
     down the leg.
},
{
    46.3,50.22
     If you relieve the pinch off the nerve, it will start to heal by having the pain travel
},
{
    50.22,53.26
     back to the starting point, which would be the low back.
},
{
    53.26,58.46
     In a nutshell, if you feel less pain and it's not traveling as far after doing these stretches,
},
{
    58.46,60.5
     then you know they are working for you.
},
{
    60.5,64.86
     So I'm going to show variations of extension exercises in different positions.
},
{
    64.86,68.44
     These will include lying on your back, your stomach, seated and
},
{
    68.44,73.14
     standing. They give you many options to experiment with so give them a try and go
},
{
    73.14,76.56
     with the ones that feel the most comfortable for you. Let's get started
},
{
    76.56,81.2
     and get feeling better right now. For this first exercise, lie on your back with a
},
{
    81.2,88.34
     rolled-up towel underneath your lower back. This exercise helps to arch your lower back, relieving pressure on the spinal discs. You can
},
{
    88.34,92.36
     also use larger objects such as a pillow to get more of an arch in the back and a
},
{
    92.36,96.54
     more intense stretch. Hold this position for up to a couple minutes at a time as
},
{
    96.54,100.78
     long as you feel comfortable and repeat. For a more advanced stretch, you can do a
},
{
    100.78,105.92
     ball arch on a stability ball. Roll the ball under you so that your back is flat on the ball.
},
{
    106.1,108.3
     The ball should follow the curve of your spine.
},
{
    108.3,113.54
     Let your back extend over it and go to a position where you feel the lower back starting to relax.
},
{
    113.8,120.6
     Hold this position to create an extension from your upper back to the lower back. For exercises lying on the stomach,
},
{
    120.6,125.08
     we'll go from the least to most intense. First is simply lying down on a flat
},
{
    125.08,129.56
     surface with a pillow under the chest. This will elevate the trunk slightly and put the
},
{
    129.56,134.12
     lower back into slight extension. To make the stretch stronger, prop yourself up on
},
{
    134.12,139.12
     the elbows and let the hips and pelvis lie as flat as possible. You want to put an arch
},
{
    139.12,143.0
     in the lower back. The advanced stretch in this position would be fully straightening
},
{
    143.0,146.78
     the arms out and getting an intense stretch in the lower back.
},
{
    146.78,152.12
     Go to your comfort levels and hold for up to 15 to 30 seconds and repeat 3 to 5 times.
},
{
    152.12,155.92
     Sitting with good posture at the edge of a chair, place your hands in the small of your
},
{
    155.92,160.48
     back for support and slowly extend your back by arching the spine backwards.
},
{
    160.48,165.06
     Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, relax, and repeat 3 to 5 times.
},
{
    165.06,168.92
     For a more intense stretch, press into the small of the back with your hands to help
},
{
    168.92,172.76
     increase the arch, but only go to what is comfortable.
},
{
    172.76,176.56
     For standing extension, the movement is similar to the seated stretch.
},
{
    176.56,179.64
     Slowly extend your lower back by arching backwards.
},
{
    179.64,184.08
     Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, relax, and repeat 3 to 5 times.
},
{
    184.08,188.08
     You can again press into the small of the back to make the stretch stronger.
},
{
    188.08,192.28
     This exercise is specifically used to treat disbolges that are pinching nerves off to
},
{
    192.28,196.08
     one side, causing sciatica or leg pain.
},
{
    196.08,199.12
     Start with your feet together, standing about a foot from a wall.
},
{
    199.12,203.12
     The leg that isn't hurting is the one that you want closest to the wall.
},
{
    203.12,206.12
     Bring your elbow to the side and then lean against the wall.
},
{
    206.12,208.58
     Slowly slide your pelvis next to the wall
},
{
    208.58,211.0
     to create a side bend in the spine.
},
{
    211.0,213.48
     Hold the pelvis next to the wall for five seconds
},
{
    213.48,215.62
     and then return to the starting position.
},
{
    215.62,218.1
     Repeat this exercise up to 10 times.
},
{
    218.1,220.72
     If your pain is still lingering or getting worse,
},
{
    220.72,223.42
     more sophisticated traction to relieve pressure
},
{
    223.42,228.9
     in the spinal disc is going to be needed to get relief. Look into spinal decompression therapy, which
},
{
    228.9,232.68
     is one of the best conservative options available that can help treat
},
{
    232.68,236.8
     herniated discs and pinched nerves. I use spinal decompression therapy in my
},
{
    236.8,240.76
     office and have gotten great results with it and have helped a lot of people
},
{
    240.76,248.38
     get long-lasting relief without the use of drugs, injections, and surgery. So I hope these stretches helped you out and you're already getting
},
{
    248.38,252.58
     some relief. If they did please show us your support by giving this video a like
