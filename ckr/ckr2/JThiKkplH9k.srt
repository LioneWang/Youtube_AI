     and liquids to pass into the esophagus.

     The pop-up bottle method was designed by German researchers with the intention of helping people
},
{
    77.92,83.84
     swallow dense tablets. To swallow tablets, the pop-up bottle way, you'll need a water bottle
},
{
    83.84,85.48
     with a narrow opening.
},
{
    85.48,88.12
     Start by placing the pill on your tongue.
},
{
    88.12,92.6
     Then bring the water bottle to your mouth and close your lips tightly around the opening.
},
{
    92.6,96.88
     While keeping contact between the bottle and your lips, use a sucking motion to swallow
},
{
    96.88,99.04
     the water and tablet.
},
{
    99.04,102.92

     inside and weigh less than water.
},
{
    105.28,110.56

     Start with your chin up and your shoulders back as you place the pill in your mouth.
},
{
    114.94,119.32
     Then take a medium sized sip of water, tilt your head forward touching your chin to your
},
{
    119.32,120.8
     chest.
},
{
    120.8,123.8
     Swallow the pill and water while your head is kept bent.
},
{
    123.8,127.56
     The idea is to move the pill back towards your throat as you tilt your head forward
},
{
    127.56,130.76
     and give you something else to focus on as you swallow.
},
{
    130.76,136.44
     Finally, you can bury the tablet or capsule in applesauce pudding or other soft food.

},
{
    145.42,149.42
     Then swallow.

    153.84,158.5
     One can grind a pill into powder or use a pill splitter to swallow smaller pieces one
},
{
    158.5,159.74
     by one.
},
{
    159.74,169.12
     One can also apply a pill coating lubricant or spray a lubricant to the back of the throat to make the pill or throat respectively more slippery to make it easier to swallow.
