     Hi, I'm Dr. Adam Fields. Welcome to day 7 of your 7 part neck relief series. I'm so
},
{
    6.84,11.76
     happy you're here. And hey, if you do this one, just start over again. Just do it
},
{
    11.76,14.88
     over and over and over again. If you want to do these videos twice a day, if your
},
{
    14.88,19.24
     neck can handle it, great. But if you feel like you need a day off, take a day off.
},
{
    19.24,23.08
     That's okay. Alright, we're going to start with a warm-up. We're going to do some
},
{
    23.08,25.04
     McKenzie extension exercises.
},
{
    25.04,27.28
     Take one hand over the other just like this,
},
{
    27.28,28.52
     put it in your low back,
},
{
    28.52,30.64
     and we're gonna just push like this,
},
{
    30.64,31.96
     pushing into the low back
},
{
    31.96,33.92
     so we get a little bit of a curve.
},
{
    33.92,37.76
     Again, that curve, gosh, there was even a study
},
{
    37.76,41.44
     that showed that men who had lost their lumbar curve
},
{
    41.44,43.76
     have a shorter life expectancy.
},
{
    43.76,45.72
     You want that lumbar curve. I
},
{
    45.72,50.16
     get all kinds of questions on that but get that curve. You want the curve
},
{
    50.16,53.68
     with the ab strength at the same time. Okay so here we go. We're going to get
},
{
    53.68,57.68
     into what's called a founder position. Your knees are going to be slightly bent.
},
{
    57.68,62.04
     That curve is there and you're going to come forward at the hip. So you have that
},
{
    62.04,69.68
     arch in your low back. The hands are going to come back, the fingers are nice and wide, coming forward like this. Feel that, pull
},
{
    69.68,73.92
     the shoulder down towards the butt, make that neck long. Good. Make it like a
},
{
    73.92,80.26
     supermodel on the runway. Neck, just super long neck. Good. Coming forward. Feel
},
{
    80.26,84.54
     the glutes engage because your weight is on your heels. Now we're
},
{
    84.54,89.24
     going to go ahead and do some neck flexions like this back and forth.
},
{
    89.24,90.24
     Good.
},
{
    90.24,96.88
     This is multi-modal, incorporating many things, not just your neck.
},
{
    96.88,97.88
     We're getting posture.
},
{
    97.88,98.88
     We're getting neck.
},
{
    98.88,99.88
     Range is emotion.
},
{
    99.88,100.88
     Good.
},
{
    100.88,104.24
     Now we're going to come up and down a little bit with the whole body.
},
{
    104.24,110.24
     Okay? So, stop moving your head, bring the arms in a little bit, pull the shoulders down towards
},
{
    110.24,114.68
     the butt and we're going to come down and up just like this.
},
{
    114.68,120.64
     Keep the arch in the low back, push down through the heels, feel that butt just wake up a little
},
{
    120.64,121.64
     bit.
},
{
    121.64,122.64
     Hello butt!
},
{
    122.64,124.68
     The glutes are so important.
},
{
    124.68,127.36
     Good. If you have glute amnesia
},
{
    127.36,132.08
     like a lot of people do, check out our core videos. I got some core videos. Boom. You're
},
{
    132.08,138.44
     going to have just that wonderful, engaged, powerful butt. Alright, let's go ahead. We're
},
{
    138.44,144.36
     going to do some lateral flexion now. Come back into your founder, hands back, fingers
},
{
    144.36,146.16
     wide, shoulders down, and we're
},
{
    146.16,150.84
     going to move the head side to side, like this. Ear to the shoulder, ear to the
},
{
    150.84,158.28
     shoulder. Good. Coming forward, arch that low back, weight goes into the heels, pull
},
{
    158.28,165.52
     the shoulders down towards the butt. Let's do the good mornings again.
},
{
    165.52,168.4
     Arms in, coming up and down.
},
{
    168.4,170.4
     Pushing down, in through the heels.
},
{
    170.4,171.4
     Good.
},
{
    171.4,172.4
     Hello, glutes.
},
{
    172.4,173.4
     Wake it up.
},
{
    173.4,174.4
     Good.
},
{
    174.4,177.4
     Chest is up.
},
{
    177.4,178.9
     Pull the shoulders down.
},
{
    178.9,181.4
     How many times can I say that?
},
{
    181.4,182.68
     Okay.
},
{
    182.68,187.0
     Let's go back into the founder, pull the shoulders down.
},
{
    187.0,190.0
     Okay, let's do some circles with the top of your head.
},
{
    190.0,194.0
     Circles, good, circles.
},
{
    194.0,196.0
     Just working with gravity a little bit different.
},
{
    196.0,201.0
     Doing it vertical is one way, doing it horizontal is another.
},
{
    201.0,203.0
     45 degrees or so is another.
},
{
    203.0,207.12
     Let's go the other direction.
},
{
    207.12,213.56
     Oh yeah, a little popping and clicking in there.
},
{
    213.56,215.04
     Move it around.
},
{
    215.04,216.04
     Good.
},
{
    216.04,218.44
     And another set of good mornings.
},
{
    218.44,229.76
     By now your low back should be fatiguing a little bit, coming up and down. Even your feet are flat, a little more weight on those
},
{
    229.76,235.12
     heels. Almost like your feet kind of want to come together without knocking your knees.
},
{
    235.12,251.8
     Really setting it. Really getting engagement on those inner thighs. Good. Okay. Let's do a little 45 degree stretch here. Pull it. Big breath in. Pull with that
},
{
    251.8,264.32
     hand. Good. Let's go other side. Oh, hello neck. Hello hydration. Okay. Let's do the founder again.
},
{
    264.32,266.3
     Slightly bend your knees. Toes are pointing straight ahead or even a little bit pigeon-toed. Okay, let's do the founder again.
},
{
    266.3,269.48
     Slightly bend your knees, toes are pointing straight ahead or even a little bit pigeon
},
{
    269.48,270.8
     towed.
},
{
    270.8,274.34
     Arch the low back, coming forward like this.
},
{
    274.34,277.34
     Hands are out, bring them up a little bit in the back.
},
{
    277.34,280.92
     Feel that tension nicely in that mid-back.
},
{
    280.92,284.08
     Your rhomboids, your scapulae are pulling together.
},
{
    284.08,293.04
     And now let's do some nods. Do I love this? Yes. Am I feeling great? Yes. Am I helping myself? Yes. Am I
},
{
    293.04,307.0
     getting better every day? Yes. Okay, let's do again coming up and down with those good mornings. Good morning.
},
{
    307.0,311.0
     Chest is up.
},
{
    311.0,314.0
     Engage those abs a little like somebody is going to punch you.
},
{
    314.0,316.0
     Like what you're, you're, you're what's called bracing, right?
},
{
    316.0,318.0
     You're just tightening up.
},
{
    318.0,323.0
     So full engagement, 360 engagement.
},
{
    323.0,327.02
     Back to that founder. Let's go ear to the shoulder. Ear to the
},
{
    327.02,336.44
     shoulder. Remind those shoulders down towards your hips. Long neck. Rock in the
},
{
    336.44,346.2
     baby here. Good. Let's go back to good mornings. Getting a little workout. Oh, it's hot. I'm sweating.
},
{
    346.2,348.2
     Okay.
},
{
    348.2,350.2
     Feel them glutes.
},
{
    350.2,351.2
     Glutezilla.
},
{
    351.2,352.2
     Glutealicious.
},
{
    352.2,353.2
     Okay.
},
{
    353.2,355.2
     Bring the hands back.
},
{
    355.2,356.2
     Beautiful.
},
{
    356.2,357.2
     Okay.
},
{
    357.2,359.2
     Now we're going to do circles.
},
{
    359.2,360.2
     Circles.
},
{
    360.2,361.2
     Oh, yeah.
},
{
    361.2,365.68
     So, people go, oh, that's my bad neck. My bad neck. oh that's my bad neck.
},
{
    365.68,366.68
     My bad neck.
},
{
    366.68,369.28
     That's not your bad neck.
},
{
    369.28,374.56
     Considering all you've put it through, what it ought, for me it's surfing, mountain biking,
},
{
    374.56,376.6
     car racks, whatever it is, right?
},
{
    376.6,378.6
     That neck's been good to you.
},
{
    378.6,380.0
     Now we need to be good to it.
},
{
    380.0,382.92
     Give it the love it needs.
},
{
    382.92,386.32
     Love your neck.
},
{
    386.32,387.32
     There it is.
},
{
    387.32,389.56
     Okay, one more.
},
{
    389.56,390.56
     Here we go.
},
{
    390.56,391.56
     Good.
},
{
    391.56,392.56
     Loving it.
},
{
    392.56,393.56
     Coming down.
},
{
    393.56,398.24
     Coming down a little further this time.
},
{
    398.24,400.56
     Just dig deep.
},
{
    400.56,410.72
     Five, four, three, 2, 1.
},
{
    410.72,414.6
     Your jaw and your suboccipital are totally connected.
},
{
    414.6,418.44
     So we want to loosen the jaw a little bit, which is actually going to help the suboccipital
},
{
    418.44,419.44
     to loosen.
},
{
    419.44,423.4
     So we're going to get a chin tuck and you're going to open your mouth, curl your tongue
},
{
    423.4,426.2
     on your lower teeth and open your mouth. We're going to open your mouth, curl your tongue on your lower teeth and open your
},
{
    426.2,429.68
     mouth and we're going to do some eye movement also.
},
{
    429.68,435.68
     So open that mouth, put the tip of your tongue behind your lower teeth, pushing down, curling
},
{
    435.68,440.0
     your tongue forward, open that jaw as wide as you can.
},
{
    440.0,441.6
     Look to the left and right.
},
{
    441.6,446.04
     Make sure your eyes go into their extreme ranges of motion all the way to the corners
},
{
    446.04,447.68
     of your eye sockets.
},
{
    447.68,448.68
     Push it a bit.
},
{
    448.68,451.06
     Move left and right, left and right.
},
{
    451.06,452.68
     We're going to open that jaw.
},
{
    452.68,453.88
     Good posture.
},
{
    453.88,455.62
     Ears over the shoulders.
},
{
    455.62,457.38
     We're counteracting your clenches.
},
{
    457.38,460.4
     We're flexing your antagonistic muscles.
},
{
    460.4,461.4
     Good.
},
{
    461.4,462.4
     Good job.
},
{
    462.4,467.02
     Okay, let's stretch the scalenes. Take your right hand, put it behind your back. Good. Good job. Okay, let's stretch the scalings. Take your right hand, put it
},
{
    467.02,471.88
     behind your back. Good. Take your left hand, put it on top of your head, and just pull.
},
{
    471.88,481.48
     Just like that. Now just look up a little bit. That hurts a little bit. Stay there
},
{
    481.48,489.04
     just a second. Let's see if that pain just dissipates just a little bit.
},
{
    490.48,491.92
     All right, let's go ahead and do the other side.
},
{
    500.4,502.08
     Left hand behind your back. Pull that ear all the way. Oh, it's good. And look up a little bit.
},
{
    505.76,508.24
     That hurts too much. Just go back down. Try and stay in that for a second though.
},
{
    509.92,515.56
     Okay, we knew the chin tuck again with the mouth open and the eye movement. Open
},
{
    515.56,520.2
     that mouth, curl that tongue, push down on those lower teeth. Remember great
},
{
    520.2,529.8
     posture. Let's begin this power yoga for your eyes. Moving them side to side. This is multimodal learning. Training your visual cortex, your
},
{
    529.8,536.64
     suboccipitals, your deep cervical nex flexors, infrascapular muscles even. Good.
},
{
    536.64,540.72
     Go for it. Left to right with your eyes. You're taking a part in your own
},
{
    540.72,553.64
     programming. Go for it. Who cares if the people around you can see you right now and think you look silly. Good job. Waking up that nervous system, challenging
},
{
    553.64,558.4
     it in different ways. Alright, let's go ahead and do a little self massage. Just get your
},
{
    558.4,562.92
     hands, just pull it right back. Just work that neck. Work the side of your neck. Go
},
{
    562.92,570.04
     deep on it a little bit. Get in there. It can handle it. You can do it. Those muscles have been working good
},
{
    570.04,576.48
     for you. They're giving you lots of response time, quickness, and movement,
},
{
    576.48,580.12
     and holding those postures, and driving, and whatnot. Let's go to the other side now.
},
{
    580.12,589.2
     Just go ahead and grab that neck. Just knead it. Knead that neck. Good. Okay, we're

{
    589.2,594.72
     going to do a little prologotic neck exercise now. So grab it. If you don't have it, you
},
{
    594.72,600.48
     can click on the link in the description and grab it or you can use a towel or whatnot.
},
{
    600.48,606.84
     Alright, good. And just use it And now bring it a little bit low.
},
{
    606.84,607.84
     We're going to start again.
},
{
    607.84,608.84
     We're going to start low this time.
},
{
    608.84,612.56
     And bring your head back and tuck the chin.
},
{
    612.56,613.56

    621.48,622.48
     Share it on social media.
},
{
    622.48,624.48
     You know, don't keep it to yourself.
},
{
    624.48,629.4
     You know how many people have neck pain that just are silently suffering that we can help together?
},
{
    630.2,631.4
     Let them know.
},
{
    632.8,634.6
     Alright, let's move it up a little bit.
},
{
    634.6,636.6
     This time we're going to go side to side.
},
{
    640.2,641.2
     Oh yeah.
},
{
    642.2,644.2
     You should be happy with yourself.

     Good job.

{
    649.0,654.0
     Now come up and we'll go back.
},
{
    654.0,659.0
     All right.
},
{
    659.0,667.0
     Now just give yourself a big hug.
},
{
    667.0,670.68
     Oh, it feels good.
},
{
    670.68,672.24
     Just a lot of flex.
},
{
    672.24,674.68
     Loosen up that thoracic spine a little bit.
},
{
    674.68,679.48
     Oh, it houses your neck.
},
{
    679.48,680.48
     Okay.
},
{
    680.48,684.48
     Oh, very good.
},
{
    684.48,687.0
     Oh, beautiful.
},
{
    687.0,690.0
     I'll see you back in day one.
},
{
    690.0,691.0
     Good job.
},
