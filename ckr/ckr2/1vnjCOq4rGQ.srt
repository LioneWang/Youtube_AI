     My name is Randy White and I'll be demonstrating the pressure dressing.
},
{
    11.52,15.64
     The first thing is, of course, is BSI to make sure that you have your gloves on.
},
{
    15.64,19.64
     The next thing is you'll need some four beforeers and as soon as you get there you want to make
},
{
    19.64,25.28
     sure that you cover that and put direct pressure, pinpoint pressure over that bleeding.
},
{
    25.28,31.64
     Okay, once you've done that, you may need to move on to a different skill like, for
},
{
    31.64,36.24
     instance, airway or treating for shock or something like that.
},
{
    36.24,39.28
     So I'm going to put a pressure dressing on it.
},
{
    39.28,44.36
     Okay, now remember, once you put this on here, you shouldn't be looking at it anymore.
},
{
    44.36,47.2
     I'm going to put an anchor wrap on.
},
{
    47.2,52.64
     An anchor wrap really is just to keep my bandage from slipping all over the place.
},
{
    52.64,60.28
     And now I'm going to, again, keeping direct pressure over the top, I'm going to be moving
},
{
    60.28,67.0
     the wrap distal to proximal, proximal to distal.
},
{
    67.0,68.0
     Okay?
},
{
    68.0,74.0
     And as I'm going to make this look a little pretty, okay?
},
{
    74.0,80.0
     Now when I want to do direct pressure over the site, okay?
},
{
    80.0,83.0
     I'm going to bring the bandage around,
},
{
    83.0,86.68
     and now I'm going to move the bandage over and now I'm going to move the bandage over and
},
{
    86.68,89.16
     put direct pressure over the site with that.
},
{
    89.16,96.48
     I'm going to come around being careful now not to drop my roller gauze because if I do
},
{
    96.48,102.88
     then I've lost a ball game and it's a lot easier to drop when you're rolling backwards.
},
{
    102.88,114.84
     Now I'm rolling forwards again. I'm going to do this one more time here and one more time here. Okay now I'm just
},
{
    114.84,127.0
     going to finish it up making sure that I put plenty of my roller gauze over the top.
},
{
    127.0,129.24
     Again tightening up as I go.
},
{
    129.24,136.72
     Making sure that the bottom side is loose so that I get good pulses.
},
{
    136.72,138.68
     Now I'll tape and tie and tuck.
},
{
    138.68,140.96
     I want to make sure that I have a good pulse here.
},
{
    140.96,146.72
     I want to make sure I've got good capillary refill here. I want to make sure I got good capillary refill here.
