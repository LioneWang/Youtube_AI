     arm, or collarbone.
},

     Cut a large piece of cloth into a square that's at least 40 inches on each side.
},
{
    31.76,40.44
     If necessary, dress any wounds or make a splint before putting the arm in a sling.
},
{
    40.44,41.64
     Step 2.
},
{
    41.64,45.0
     Fold the cloth diagonally in half, forming a triangle.
},
{
    45.0,51.0
     Step 3. Drape the triangle so its base runs up and down the chest opposite the injured
},
{
    51.0,56.0
     side, with the top corner dangling over and behind the shoulder on the un-injured side
},
{
    56.0,61.0
     and the bottom corner hanging below the waist. The corner opposite the base should wrap part

    66.6,70.24
     Gently support the injured arm at the elbow across the torso.
},
{
    70.24,71.8
     Step 5.
},
{
    71.8,75.4
     Lift the bottom corner up so the sling now cradles the injured arm.
},
{
    75.4,79.96

},
{
    79.96,82.52

},
{
    82.52,86.72

},
{
    86.72,88.04

     too high.

    109.98,111.98
     shirt.

    111.98,112.98
     Step 7.
},
{
    112.98,117.86
