{

     So now let's take a look at the conscious infant choking patient.
},
{
    15.32,20.24
     There's a few things that should tip us off that the baby is fully conscious but also
},
{
    20.24,21.6
     fully choking.
},
{
    21.6,29.44
     And that is that their eyes are open, they may be gagging, they're still moving around, but they're not breathing, they're not coughing and they're certainly
},
{
    29.44,33.72
     not even able to babble or if they're able to speak they're not saying any words.
},
{
    33.72,38.96
     You may even start to see this thing called circummoral cyanosis, that's a blue ring
},
{
    38.96,43.56
     that starts to form around the lips of the baby indicating that they're beginning to
},
{
    43.56,45.24
     starve of oxygen and
},
{
    45.24,48.08
     our treatment is really necessary.
},
{
    48.08,52.44
     If you have a bystander nearby, it wouldn't be a bad idea and it would certainly be in
},
{
    52.44,57.8
     the best interest of the baby if you had them call 911 and get the ambulance on the way.
},
{
    57.8,61.6
     If you didn't have anybody around, you could certainly call 911 but I still think it's
},
{
    61.6,68.16
     in the best interest of the baby for you to begin doing the treatment first and wait until the baby goes unconscious if
},
{
    68.16,72.48
     it's up to you to have to call 911. So what we're going to do is we're going to
},
{
    72.48,76.04
     remove this onesie so that I can really show you the landmarks that are
},
{
    76.04,80.56
     important as we begin to demonstrate the skill related to getting this
},
{
    80.56,84.84
     obstruction clear. I'm going to place my thumb and forefinger over the cheekbones
},
{
    84.84,86.84
     of the baby's face,
},
{
    86.84,88.8
     supporting the head and neck,
},
{
    88.8,90.98
     letting them rest on my forearm
},
{
    90.98,92.88
     while they straddle my bicep.
},
{
    93.84,96.2
     I'm now gonna take the opposite palm
},
{
    96.2,100.34
     and use that to give five back blows or back slaps
},
{
    100.34,102.6
     between the shoulder blades of the baby.
},
{
    102.6,104.72
     It's important to remember that the head of the baby
},
{
    104.72,105.5
     is down while the feet are higher of the baby. It's important to remember that the head of the baby is down
},
{
    105.5,108.0
     while the feet are higher than the head.
},
{
    108.0,111.5
     That allows gravity to work with us, not against us.
},
{
    111.5,113.0
     Five back blows.
},
{
    113.0,116.0
     One, two, three, four, five.
},
{
    117.5,120.5
     Sandwich the baby's head and neck to support the neck and head.
},
{
    120.5,122.5
     Ring finger across the nipple line,
},
{
    122.5,125.52
     two fingers down on the chest, on the sternum,
},
{
    125.52,132.8
     and now we're going to repeat with five chest thrusts. One, two, three, four, five. If the baby
},
{
    132.8,138.96
     did not get rid of the obstruction and indicating that with breathing again, coughing, gagging,
},
{
    138.96,145.48
     starting to try to cry, we're simply going to repeat the process. We're going to sandwich thumb
},
{
    145.48,150.08
     and forefinger over the cheekbones, flip the baby back over, face down,
},
{
    150.08,157.8
     straddling our bicep, and repeat with five back blows. One, two, three, four, five.
},
{
    157.8,163.6
     Turn the baby over, ring finger across the nipple line, five more chest thrusts.
},
{
    163.6,166.9
     One, two, three, four, five.
},
{
    166.9,172.1
     We're going to continue to do these back blows and chest thrusts until the object comes out,
},
{
    172.1,176.9
     the baby begins to breathe again, or the baby goes unconscious.
},
{
    176.9,181.3
     If the baby goes unconscious, it's at this time that we, if we haven't done it already,
},
{
    181.3,185.04
     we call 911 and get an ambulance on the way. If the baby
},
{
    185.04,190.08
     does go unconscious, we then move into the unconscious infant choking procedure.
},
{
    190.08,194.36
     But it's important to note that when we're doing the back blows and the chest
},
{
    194.36,198.92
     thrusts, make sure we don't let our arms sag with each of those compressions or
},
{
    198.92,204.44
     back blows, as when it sinks down, it diminishes the effect of the actual
},
{
    204.44,206.4
     chest thrusts that are forcing
},
{
    206.4,209.68
     the air up the trachea to pop that object out.
},
{
    209.68,215.16
     Keep in mind that this is about 80% effective when you do the chest thrust and the back
},
{
    215.16,216.16
     blows.
},
{
    216.16,219.92
     It's an extremely effective procedure and it can work really well if you run into this
},
{
    219.92,220.88
     type of situation.
},
