     In this video, I'm going to show you how to decompress your back in bed for instant pain relief. Stay tuned.
},
{
    10.32,15.04
     Hey everyone, Dr. Roe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. In this video, we're going
},
{
    15.04,20.56
     to go over decompression or pulling motions throughout the whole back to take pressure out of spinal
},
{
    20.56,29.3
     discs that might be causing back pain or sciatica. All of these exercises are easy, effective, and can be done in the comfort of your bed.
},
{
    29.3,34.38
     And the great part is it may give quick relief too, even in as little as 30 seconds.
},
{
    34.38,36.06
     Go through all of the exercises.
},
{
    36.06,38.88
     It's going to hit the back just a little bit differently.
},
{
    38.88,43.5
     So take what is most effective at getting rid of your back pain or sciatica pain.
},
{
    43.5,46.84
     So let's get started and get the back feeling better right now.
},
{
    46.84,50.76
     This decompression exercise is what I'd like to call the back hammer because it's very
},
{
    50.76,54.16
     good at hitting specific spots in the lower back.
},
{
    54.16,56.8
     Let's start off on our back in bed just like this.
},
{
    56.8,61.04
     Our legs are going to be off, knees bent roughly at 90 degrees, feet are going to be flat during
},
{
    61.04,62.32
     this exercise.
},
{
    62.32,66.76
     That way we can push and pull and slide our body off the edge of this bed.
},
{
    66.76,69.96
     Arms go straight at the elbow, hands are going to grip at the edge.
},
{
    69.96,76.62
     What I'm going to do from here is slowly slide my body off the edge of that bed to the point
},
{
    76.62,81.68
     where my hips and my buttock are off the edge of that bed and gravity is starting to take
},
{
    81.68,84.4
     my lower body weight down towards the floor.
},
{
    84.4,89.0
     Let's reposition the knees at 90 degrees like this feet are also again going to be flat.
},
{
    89.0,93.4
     When you do this it's going to put the back into extension which helps take
},
{
    93.4,98.36
     pressure off spinal discs. It should feel like a very deep stretch at the very
},
{
    98.36,103.92
     low end of the lumbar spine. This should be targeting L5. From here let's hold
},
{
    103.92,106.4
     this position comfortably for 30 seconds.
},
{
    106.4,111.84
     Do nice slow controlled breathing also. Just let the tension out. The more you relax, the better
},
{
    111.84,117.36
     this treatment will be. From here, what we're going to do is slowly just inch down a little bit more
},
{
    117.36,122.64
     and try to target the next segment above, which would be L4. The great part about this exercise,
},
{
    122.64,126.32
     we're going to target L5 all the way through L1,
},
{
    126.32,128.48
     all of the segments of the lower back.
},
{
    128.48,130.56
     Again, just repeat this.
},
{
    130.56,133.16
     We're going to reposition our legs so this is comfortable.
},
{
    133.16,136.84
     We're going to let gravity take it down towards the floor and just hold this position for
},
{
    136.84,138.72
     30 seconds.
},
{
    138.72,143.04
     And then just repeat all the way up to the top of the lower back.
},
{
    143.04,145.2
     When you do this, you're going to notice that one
},
{
    145.2,151.76
     certain spot hits it just a little bit better, gives you more relief. Maybe it's right here for me.
},
{
    151.76,156.96
     Make note of that. That's the spot that you're going to want to concentrate on and throw more
},
{
    156.96,162.08
     repetitions in. I would recommend doing this three to five times and just kind of relaxing
},
{
    162.08,169.62
     after about 30 seconds and then repeating. If this becomes too easy, you can take it to the next level by raising your body up and
},
{
    169.62,175.0
     taking one arm and sliding it underneath the back right at the edge of the bed.
},
{
    175.0,180.36
     This will put the back into more extension and at that point intensifying the stretch.
},
{
    180.36,184.8
     You can also use a rolled up towel or even a pillow underneath your back.
},
{
    184.8,185.96
     So experiment with that.
},
{
    185.96,188.32
     If you get more relief, use it.
},
{
    188.32,193.08
     But you can also take this one to the next, next level by incorporating a lateral lean
},
{
    193.08,195.9
     into it to take more pressure off the back.
},
{
    195.9,199.12
     So let's go back to that spot that's offering us the most amount of relief.
},
{
    199.12,200.36
     Let's say it's right here for me.
},
{
    200.36,204.12
     What I'm going to do is cross my arms over my shoulders like this.
},
{
    204.12,209.4
     I always call it the mummy. And then from there, I'm going to take one shoulder and try to just go towards
},
{
    209.4,215.12
     one edge of the bed, keeping my back flat during this whole exercise. When you do this,
},
{
    215.12,219.88
     you're going to feel the back start to open up just a little bit differently. So experiment
},
{
    219.88,224.08
     with this. Go all the way towards the left or until a point where you feel relief. Hold
},
{
    224.08,228.84
     that for about 30 seconds. Relax. And then you can repeat this. You can also try it
},
{
    228.84,233.0
     on the other side. But go through all of the motions. Target the spots that need
},
{
    233.0,237.52
     at the most and throw more repetitions in. So two of my absolute favorite back
},
{
    237.52,243.2
     exercises are the Child's Pose and the Cobra. Two yoga positions. And when you
},
{
    243.2,246.08
     put them together it pretty much is going to help target
},
{
    246.08,248.0
     and decompress the whole back
},
{
    248.0,250.08
     from the shoulders down to the tailbone.
},
{
    250.08,251.76
     And they're very easy to do.
},
{
    251.76,253.92
     To start off with, let's go on all fours
},
{
    253.92,255.08
     in bed just like this.
},
{
    255.08,257.32
     I like to have my feet off to the side of the bed
},
{
    257.32,258.68
     or at the edge of the bed, I should say.
},
{
    258.68,262.88
     And I hook at the edge with my feet for a stable anchor point.
},
{
    262.88,268.36
     From here, let's start off by doing the child's pose. I'm going to tuck my chin towards my chest like this, pull my
},
{
    268.36,272.64
     arms out in front of me. From there I'm just going to lower my butt down towards
},
{
    272.64,276.56
     the heels as much as I can while I keep my arms straight and just really grip
},
{
    276.56,280.08
     into the bed with your fingers. Once we have a very comfortable stretch let's
},
{
    280.08,283.48
     try to inch forward with our fingers just a little bit to intensify the stretch.
},
{
    283.48,288.88
     The key is to allow the upper body chest to sag down towards the bed.
},
{
    288.88,291.56
     It will help really stretch in between the shoulder blades.
},
{
    291.56,295.64
     But with this, you should feel a full back stretch from the shoulders all the way down
},
{
    295.64,296.64
     to the tailbone.
},
{
    296.64,299.32
     Hold this comfortably for 30 seconds.
},
{
    299.32,301.44
     Do nice slow controlled breathing also.
},
{
    301.44,303.12
     Let that tension out.
},
{
    303.12,305.2
     From there, we're going to go into the cobra.
},
{
    305.2,311.28
     So we just rock forward like this to the point where our hips and our pelvis go flat. During this
},
{
    311.28,317.28
     exercise we want to make sure to have our hips and pelvis flat. We're not arching up like this.
},
{
    317.28,323.04
     We're putting the lower back into extension which will help decompress those spinal discs.
},
{
    323.04,325.44
     If this position right here is too much,
},
{
    325.44,327.56
     you can do what is known as a half cobra.
},
{
    327.56,329.32
     So instead of straightening the arms,
},
{
    329.32,331.92
     we just go onto the elbows just like this.
},
{
    331.92,334.32
     So experiment with them, go with whatever you feel
},
{
    334.32,335.64
     is the most comfortable.
},
{
    335.64,338.8
     But you want to hold this position for 20 to 30 seconds.
},
{
    338.8,341.12
     Again, do nice, slow, controlled breathing.
},
{
    341.12,344.08
     From there, we're just gonna go back into the child's pose.
},
{
    344.08,347.56
     And with the next repetition, always challenge yourself also
},
{
    347.56,349.72
     to stretch down a little bit further
},
{
    349.72,351.68
     to intensify this stretch.
},
{
    351.68,354.44
     But you want to just repeat this nice and slow
},
{
    354.44,358.0
     for about three to five complete repetitions.
},
{
    358.0,360.48
     If you want to take this one to the next level,
},
{
    360.48,363.4
     what you can do is instead of going straight out with it,
},
{
    363.4,366.08
     let's angle our body just very slightly
},
{
    366.08,367.06
     towards one direction.
},
{
    367.06,369.8
     I'll go a little bit towards my right and then repeat.
},
{
    369.8,372.08
     What you'll notice is that this hits the back
},
{
    372.08,373.76
     just a little bit differently.
},
{
    373.76,375.52
     So go all the way towards the right
},
{
    375.52,377.84
     and then go all the way towards the left.
},
{
    377.84,379.72
     If you notice that one certain angle
},
{
    379.72,382.12
     hits it a little bit better, make note of that,
},
{
    382.12,383.92
     throw more repetitions in.
},
{
    383.92,387.46
     And you can also repeat this while doing the cobra.
},
{
    387.46,392.92
     So give that a try and focus on the spots that you feel just need a little bit more
},
{
    392.92,394.28
     attention.
},
{
    394.28,400.22
     So here is a great three-part exercise that you can progress into to increase the intensity.
},
{
    400.22,403.24
     We're going to start off on our stomach in bed just like this.
},
{
    403.24,407.84
     Let's put a pillow or towel underneath our hips, our pelvis to create an anchor point
},
{
    407.84,410.52
     and also give us a little bit more comfort.
},
{
    410.52,411.52
     First part is very easy.
},
{
    411.52,416.2
     What I'm going to do is slowly slide forward until my shoulders and my head are completely
},
{
    416.2,418.16
     off the edge of that bed.
},
{
    418.16,421.0
     From there, just allow gravity to take them both.
},
{
    421.0,424.52
     When you do this, you're already going to feel a very good stretch happening into the
},
{
    424.52,430.16
     lower back that works its way up to the upper back. Try to hold this for about 30 seconds. Do nice,
},
{
    430.16,435.28
     slow, controlled breathing. Again, the more you relax, the better this exercise will be.
},
{
    435.28,440.56
     But if you want, from here, you could hold this for a longer period of time. If it feels good,
},
{
    440.56,447.66
     hold it for several minutes. Grab a book, an iPhone, anything. Just take your mind off it and let gravity do all of the work.
},
{
    447.66,450.8
     If you need to breathe, just slide back just like this and take one.
},
{
    450.8,454.8
     You want to try to do this for about three to five complete repetitions.
},
{
    454.8,459.28
     You can slide forward just a little bit more with each repetition also because that's only
},
{
    459.28,464.4
     going to intensify the stretch because gravity is taking more body weight, increasing that
},
{
    464.4,467.0
     traction throughout the whole back.
},
{
    467.0,472.0
     In the second part, let's take this one to the next level. What I'm going to do is keep going forward
},
{
    472.0,478.0
     off the edge of the bed until I can go on my elbows just like this. I want my body weight to be supported
},
{
    478.0,485.84
     on my forearms and my elbows. My elbows go slightly pointed out from my body. I just interlock my hands just like this for
},
{
    485.84,490.52
     a very stable anchor point. Let's tuck the chin towards the chest very slightly. From
},
{
    490.52,496.96
     here this should be a very, very good stretch, pretty much into the lower back all the way
},
{
    496.96,502.68
     up to the upper back. We want to hold this position for about 30 seconds. Do nice low
},
{
    502.68,505.16
     control breathing again. When you need a breather,
},
{
    505.16,507.4
     you can just push yourself back up.
},
{
    507.4,510.24
     But you want to do this one for about three to five
},
{
    510.24,511.44
     complete repetitions.
},
{
    511.44,512.48
     Again, if it feels good,
},
{
    512.48,515.28
     you can hold it for an extended period of time.
},
{
    515.28,516.12
     In the third part,
},
{
    516.12,518.76
     we can really make this a lot stronger
},
{
    518.76,522.2
     by incorporating more of a child's pose position into this.
},
{
    522.2,524.04
     So instead of going up on our elbows,
},
{
    524.04,526.88
     what I'm going to do is straighten my arms out
},
{
    526.88,528.12
     just like this.
},
{
    528.12,532.28
     Take my fingers, grip into the floor of the carpet, and from here tuck the chin towards
},
{
    532.28,536.28
     the chest and then crawl forward with the arms as much as you can.
},
{
    536.28,540.08
     The more that you crawl forward with the arms, the more that you're going to feel it throughout
},
{
    540.08,541.08
     the back.
},
{
    541.08,546.0
     Also, let the chest try to sag down towards the floor because that will also help stretch
},
{
    546.0,551.6
     the upper back even more. But once we feel a very good traction throughout the whole back,
},
{
    551.6,558.08
     let's hold this position for 30 seconds. Again, if you need a breather, just push yourself back up
},
{
    558.08,564.24
     with your arms pulled with your legs. But you want to do this for three to five complete repetitions.
},
{
    564.24,567.2
     To take this one even to the next level,
},
{
    567.2,569.28
     I don't know how many times I've said that so far,
},
{
    569.28,571.28
     what I'm going to do is turn my body
},
{
    571.28,573.48
     and angle it towards one certain direction.
},
{
    573.48,576.52
     So in this case, I'm going all the way towards my right.
},
{
    576.52,578.56
     When you do this, you're going to feel the muscles
},
{
    578.56,581.16
     and the back, it hit just a little bit differently.
},
{
    581.16,584.04
     So experiment with going all the way towards the right,
},
{
    584.04,585.56
     go all the way towards the left.
},
{
    585.56,587.72
     If you notice that one certain spot,
},
{
    587.72,589.92
     like right here on this right side for me,
},
{
    589.92,591.68
     hits it just the best,
},
{
    591.68,593.16
     what I'm going to do at that point
},
{
    593.16,594.84
     is throw more repetitions in
},
{
    594.84,598.16
     because I'm targeting areas that's releasing pressure
},
{
    598.16,600.4
     and also offering relief.
