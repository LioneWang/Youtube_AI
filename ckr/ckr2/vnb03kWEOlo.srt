     In this video, I'm going to show you the quickest and best way to fix neck pain at home.
},
{
    5.28,6.28
     Stay tuned.
},
{
    6.28,7.28
     Hey, everyone.
},
{
    7.28,15.76
     Dr. O'Clock coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan.
},
{
    15.76,20.52
     If you're in need of a quick neck pain fix and you're stuck at home, this is a video
},
{
    20.52,22.48
     that you're not going to want to miss.
},
{
    22.48,25.16
     We're going to focus on safe, natural movements
},
{
    25.16,26.96
     that will help open up the neck
},
{
    26.96,28.88
     and also increase range of motion,
},
{
    28.88,32.16
     hopefully giving pain relief in as little as 30 seconds.
},
{
    32.16,34.96
     All of these motions, I'm going to use
},
{
    34.96,38.0
     just everyday things around the house,
},
{
    38.0,40.04
     a couch, a chair, things like that,
},
{
    40.04,43.0
     so hopefully you'll have all of this equipment.
},
{
    43.0,47.04
     The only thing that I will be using is a pull-up band for one of the exercises.
},
{
    47.04,49.16
     That's the only special equipment that we're going to be using.
},
{
    49.16,52.56
     A pull-up band you can buy locally at a sporting goods department.
},
{
    52.56,56.16
     You can also get them online, such as at Amazon.
},
{
    56.16,59.88
     But all of these motions, they're very easy, simple to do, and you may find that they give
},
{
    59.88,61.4
     you the fix that you're looking for.
},
{
    61.4,64.68
     So let's get started with it and get the neck feeling better at home.
},
{
    64.68,71.36
     So for this first at-home neck pain relief exercise, I'm going to be using an everyday hand drying
},
{
    71.36,72.36
     towel.
},
{
    72.36,73.68
     It's just a medium-sized towel.
},
{
    73.68,75.64
     Let's roll it up just like this.
},
{
    75.64,80.64
     What I'm going to do is I'm going to put the towel at the base of the skull right here,
},
{
    80.64,82.72
     the top portion of the neck.
},
{
    82.72,87.18
     I'm just going to put it just like that and then grab the ends of the towel.
},
{
    87.18,93.14
     From here, what I want to do is focus on building range of motion into the neck through rotation.
},
{
    93.14,95.38
     That is turning the head from side to side.
},
{
    95.38,99.3
     So if you're having difficulty turning to one side, this is going to really help.
},
{
    99.3,105.96
     Hold one end stationary while the other one then turns the head towards one certain
},
{
    105.96,110.8
     direction. Only go to a point where you feel a very good stretch. You want to
},
{
    110.8,115.16
     hold this for about 10 to 15 seconds. You're just going to relax and then
},
{
    115.16,121.28
     you're going to repeat this up to five times, holding for again 15 seconds. And
},
{
    121.28,128.84
     then you're just going to go towards the opposite side. Even if the other side doesn't hurt, on all of these exercises you want to do them on
},
{
    128.84,132.04
     both sides to keep the muscles in balance.
},
{
    132.04,135.72
     But the key is only going to your comfort level.
},
{
    135.72,140.36
     So how we're going to build a little bit more traction to help open up the neck with this
},
{
    140.36,145.74
     exercise, let's grab the ends right here, but let's crisscross our arms like this.
},
{
    145.74,148.0
     Hold this side stationary again with this hand,
},
{
    148.0,149.46
     but with this one, what we're going to do
},
{
    149.46,152.16
     is we're going to lift up and then over towards the ceiling,
},
{
    152.16,155.16
     almost at a nice angle, kind of like 45 degrees.
},
{
    155.16,156.54
     So watch how I do this.
},
{
    156.54,159.2
     I'm going to pull, hold this one stationary,
},
{
    159.2,160.24
     and then lift up.
},
{
    160.24,162.7
     I'm almost kind of going through my eye with this.
},
{
    162.7,167.96
     You should feel an upward pull into the neck with this one on top of the rotation.
},
{
    167.96,170.46
     Hold this one for about 10 to 15 seconds.
},
{
    170.46,175.3
     You're just going to relax and then you're going to repeat this up to five times and
},
{
    175.3,179.12
     then just switch to the opposite side to do the same thing with that.
},
{
    179.12,184.68
     A great way to just build a little bit more movement into the neck very, very easily with
},
{
    184.68,185.56
     a towel.
},
{
    185.56,191.16
     So let's build off that last neck pain exercise with a neck decompression exercise that you
},
{
    191.16,193.56
     can do with a countertop.
},
{
    193.56,198.56
     If the countertop is too high, you can also use a chair, a bed, or your couch.
},
{
    198.56,203.76
     What I'm going to do is put a pillow underneath my knees and go up to a countertop.
},
{
    203.76,205.04
     Let's take our rolled up towel,
},
{
    205.04,206.72
     put it back into that original position
},
{
    206.72,208.4
     that we did with that first exercise,
},
{
    208.4,211.68
     and let's put our back of our arms
},
{
    211.68,214.54
     completely flat against the countertop.
},
{
    214.54,217.6
     We want our back nice and straight while we do this.
},
{
    217.6,222.12
     What I'm going to do is just raise the towel up slightly
},
{
    222.12,225.46
     towards the ceiling and then hold onto to the two ends. Let's
},
{
    225.46,229.42
     pull it forward with our hands just to make sure there's no slack at the base
},
{
    229.42,234.82
     of the skull. From this point what I'm going to do is lower my butt towards my
},
{
    234.82,238.98
     heels. Gravity is going to help you with this so when you do this you're going to
},
{
    238.98,244.36
     feel a very good pull into the neck. Only go to your comfort level. You want to
},
{
    244.36,245.0
     hold this one for 15 seconds. If you're able to your comfort level. You want to hold this one
},
{
    245.0,250.52
     for 15 seconds. If you're able to, you can work your way up to a half minute. Then
},
{
    250.52,256.8
     just relax and then you're just going to simply repeat this up to five times. If
},
{
    256.8,260.88
     you feel that one side needs a little bit more attention, what you can do just
},
{
    260.88,265.48
     like that first exercise is hold one side completely stationary, lift
},
{
    265.48,270.6
     the other one up to turn the head a little bit into rotation, and then lower your butt
},
{
    270.6,272.64
     down towards your heels.
},
{
    272.64,278.18
     Again, holding for 15 to 30 seconds, relaxing three to five times, and then if you feel
},
{
    278.18,281.12
     like switching to the other side, you can do that too.
},
{
    281.12,286.12
     So here's another decompression stretch that you can do for the neck using a couch.
},
{
    286.12,289.76
     Let's just put a pillow right here over the arm of a couch.
},
{
    289.76,294.44
     And what I'm going to do is I'm going to position my pelvis over that, and then I'm
},
{
    294.44,299.4
     going to then take my towel and put it at the back of the neck.
},
{
    299.4,304.28
     What I'm going to do with this is start off by just pulling forward with the towel to
},
{
    304.28,306.28
     build a slight traction
},
{
    306.28,307.68
     into the neck.
},
{
    307.68,312.12
     From there what I'm going to do is I'm going to lift my feet off the floor and then I'm
},
{
    312.12,317.16
     just going to allow my lower body to roll down the edge or I should say the arm of
},
{
    317.16,318.16
     the couch.
},
{
    318.16,322.76
     When you do this gravity is going to just take your lower body weight and increase the
},
{
    322.76,327.24
     amount of traction that you're feeling into your back all the way to the neck.
},
{
    327.24,332.04
     You can hold this one for up to 30 seconds, possibly longer if you feel comfortable, but
},
{
    332.04,336.76
     at any point you feel that you need a break, just lower your feet, take a little bit of
},
{
    336.76,341.68
     a breather, and then you're just going to repeat this up to five times.
},
{
    341.68,346.08
     It's just, again, a great way for gravity to do most of the work while you get a good traction
},
{
    346.08,349.02
     into the neck and hopefully get some good pain relief.
},
{
    349.02,350.02
     Give this one a try.
},
{
    350.02,351.98
     So here's another good way that we can put
},
{
    351.98,354.98
     a decompression stretch or self-traction
},
{
    354.98,357.14
     into the neck on our couch.
},
{
    357.14,359.7
     You can also do this at the edge of your bed.
},
{
    359.7,362.3
     So let's position ourself to where our chest
},
{
    362.3,365.68
     and our shoulders are pretty much just slightly
},
{
    365.68,367.06
     off the edge right here.
},
{
    367.06,371.08
     Let's take our towel and put this at the back of the head.
},
{
    371.08,373.68
     Just do a slight chin tuck with this.
},
{
    373.68,380.28
     What I'm going to do is just pull forward with the two ends of my towel until I feel
},
{
    380.28,384.56
     a very, very good stretch into my neck.
},
{
    384.56,387.08
     Again, only to your comfort level.
},
{
    387.08,392.68
     You want to hold this up to 30 seconds if you're able to, and then just relax,
},
{
    392.68,398.8
     and then repeat up to five times. Again, if you feel that one certain direction
},
{
    398.8,402.72
     needs to be opened up a little bit more to give relief, hold one end stationary
},
{
    402.72,410.08
     while the other one goes slightly at an angle. Again, holding this one for 30 seconds, relaxing, and then
},
{
    410.08,415.06
     repeating this up to five times. It's just a good way to allow gravity to help
},
{
    415.06,419.8
     us out and again get a very good pulling traction into the neck to relieve
},
{
    419.8,424.48
     pressure into those spinal discs and hopefully give quick relief. So this next
},
{
    424.48,426.12
     self-traction for the neck
},
{
    426.12,427.06
     that you can do at home,
},
{
    427.06,429.42
     I'm going to be using my pull-up band.
},
{
    429.42,433.8
     I put it around the handle on the backside of the door,
},
{
    433.8,437.12
     close the door firmly so it's nice and sturdy.
},
{
    437.12,438.32
     It's not going to come back
},
{
    438.32,439.84
     and obviously whack us in our face.
},
{
    439.84,442.2
     And then I also took a hand drying towel
},
{
    442.2,445.6
     and I just wrapped it on the other end for comfort.
},
{
    445.6,450.16
     So what I'm going to do is lay flat on my back like this and I'm going to take the
},
{
    450.16,453.58
     other end and place it right at the back of the skull.
},
{
    453.58,458.9
     And then from there what I'm going to do is I'm going to slowly start to use my body
},
{
    458.9,462.08
     weight to inch out from the door.
},
{
    462.08,465.46
     The more that you inch out, the more tension is going to be
},
{
    465.46,470.34
     placed right here on these bands. What I'd like to do is slightly tuck the chin
},
{
    470.34,476.18
     and keep going out until you feel a very good traction start to be formed into
},
{
    476.18,481.1
     the neck. I just place my hands down at the side right here. So with this one
},
{
    481.1,487.94
     right here, you're going to feel a very good amount of traction starting to get pulled through the pull-up band right here.
},
{
    488.3,493.66
     Again, only go to your comfort level. Try to hold this one for up to 30 seconds.
},
{
    493.66,497.48
     With this one, you can actually go for much longer, a minute if you feel a lot of relief.
},
{
    497.48,502.86
     And then from there, you can just use your upper body weight to go backwards to take a little bit of a breather.
},
{
    502.86,507.58
     But on the next time, try to go just a little bit further with it because you're going to find that it
},
{
    507.58,511.28
     offers a little bit more neck traction hopefully to open up those spinal discs
},
{
    511.28,515.98
     and give more pain relief. But for the second part what you can end up doing is
},
{
    515.98,519.46
     working a little bit more in the upper back by taking the arms and then just
},
{
    519.46,524.1
     going back up there back like this towards the wall. So what I'd like to do
},
{
    524.1,525.92
     is just kind of like a nice,
},
{
    525.92,528.24
     even motion while I do this.
},
{
    528.24,530.72
     And you can do this for up to five times,
},
{
    530.72,534.52
     holding for 30 seconds, possibly even upwards,
},
{
    534.52,535.8
     towards a minute.
},
{
    535.8,538.32
     But once you're done, you just kind of slide back,
},
{
    538.32,541.4
     take it off, and use as needed.
},
{
    541.4,543.16
     Give that one a try, very easy to do.
