     Hi, I'm Dr. Adam Fields. Welcome to your day two evening session of 360 breathing.
},
{
    6.28,12.36
     It's time to go from multitasking to monotasking. Letting it all go. The only
},
{
    12.36,17.32
     task you're gonna have to do here is breathe. So go ahead, get yourself a nice
},
{
    17.32,23.04
     comfortable spot, either sitting or even lying down is great. And let's start
},
{
    23.04,26.48
     breathing. Yesterday we did abdominal breathing,
},
{
    26.48,28.08
     today we did lateral breathing,
},
{
    28.08,29.96
     we're gonna integrate the two right now,
},
{
    29.96,33.4
     and we're actually gonna go for a four second in,
},
{
    33.4,36.2
     eight second out cadence.
},
{
    36.2,37.68
     Don't be too concerned about it,
},
{
    37.68,40.24
     I just want a little quicker on the inhale
},
{
    40.24,42.32
     than we have on the exhale.
},
{
    42.32,44.72
     So let's go ahead, exhale all your air out,
},
{
    44.72,46.56
     put one hand on the top, one hand on the bottom,
},
{
    46.56,47.52
     and breathe in.
},
{
    47.52,50.8
     And exhale.
},
{
    50.8,57.76
     And inhale.
},
{
    61.76,62.56
     And exhale.
},
{
    68.4,70.44
     And exhale. Nice and relaxed.
},
{
    70.44,72.08
     Inhaling.
},
{
    72.08,75.12
     Exhaling.
},
{
    75.12,81.48
     Keep going on your own.
},
{
    81.48,83.48
     Inhaling.
},
{
    83.48,85.0
     Exhaling.
},
{
    88.0,95.0
     Exhaling. Good. Almost like an ocean. Just seeing that tide coming in over the sand, breathing in.
},
{
    96.0,100.0
     And out back to the ocean, breathing out.
},
{
    102.0,109.84
     Ocean coming in, breathing in.
},
{
    109.84,117.04
     Ocean going out, breathing out.
},
{
    117.04,121.96
     Breathing in.
},
{
    121.96,126.9
     Breathing out, letting it go.
},
{
    126.9,133.88
     Really superimpose that ocean into your body, into your lungs, seeing it filtering into
},
{
    133.88,172.6
     you. Get rid of that stagnant air out of your lungs.
},
{
    172.6,207.0
     Keep it going. Present moment. Goodbye stale air.
},
{
    211.0,219.0
     In through the nostrils.
},
{
    223.0,225.36
     Bring it in. Smooth transition.
},
{
    231.2,236.64
     All the way in for three, two, one, exhale.
},
{
    244.28,250.4
     Bring it in. Detox those lungs.
},
{
    250.4,257.52
     Nurturing breath.
},
{
    257.52,262.04
     Bring it out.
},
{
    262.04,267.04
     Relax the body.
},
{
    270.8,271.52
     On your own, inhale.
},
{
    275.48,279.56
     Beautiful, letting it go.
},
{
    283.52,285.2
     Goodbye, cortisol. Inhale. Hello melaton.
},
{
    291.2,297.04
     Bring it in for four. Three, two, one. Let it go.
},
{
    304.7,315.5
     You're doing great. Bring it in for four, three, two, one.
},
{
    315.5,317.06
     Time for recovery.
},
{
    317.06,321.7
     Big breath in.
},
{
    321.7,328.18
     All body systems.
},
{
    328.18,332.48
     Big breath in.
},
{
    332.48,345.68
     Blood pressure going down. Bring it on in.
},
{
    345.68,351.84
     Letting it go.
},
{
    351.84,356.4
     You're doing great.
},
{
    356.4,358.4
     Letting it go.
},
{
    358.4,364.32
     Letting that body go.
},
{
    364.32,370.08
     Return now to the natural measure of your breath and just bask in what that gave you.
},
{
    370.08,377.68
     That breath just nurtured your body, massaged your cells, detoxified, down-regulated your
},
{
    377.68,379.2
     nervous system.
},
{
    379.2,382.28
     How wonderful it is to be with you here.
},
{
    382.28,388.0
     I look forward to seeing you tomorrow morning for day three of your 360 breathing.
},
