     In this video, I'm going to show you how to fix your knee pain for good at home.
},
{
    4.84,5.84
     Stay tuned.
},
{
    5.84,6.84
     Hey, everyone.
},
{
    6.84,14.4
     Dr. Rowe from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan.
},
{
    14.4,19.04
     If you're dealing with a locked up stiff achy knee and need a quick relief, especially
},
{
    19.04,22.56
     at home, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss.
},
{
    22.56,24.92
     I'm going to break it down into three parts.
},
{
    24.92,28.66
     The first part is going to focus on the soft tissue around the knee, including the muscle
},
{
    28.66,29.66
     and ligaments.
},
{
    29.66,31.7
     We're going to do a self massage per se.
},
{
    31.7,35.94
     The second part, I'm going to show you a very good traction exercise that you can do at
},
{
    35.94,40.26
     home that doesn't require any special equipment that will help open up the knee joint and
},
{
    40.26,43.54
     hopefully provide some quick relief and better motion.
},
{
    43.54,46.2
     The third part, we need to focus on strengthening the knee
},
{
    46.2,48.4
     and its surrounding soft tissues,
},
{
    48.4,50.8
     so hopefully we will have a lot less instances
},
{
    50.8,52.9
     of knee pain in the future.
},
{
    52.9,56.34
     If you have to ask, will this help XYZ condition
},
{
    56.34,58.08
     of the knee, my answer is always going to be,
},
{
    58.08,60.58
     get it looked at by your doctor instead.
},
{
    60.58,62.88
     This video is designed for simple strains
},
{
    62.88,63.88
     and sprains of the knee.
},
{
    63.88,70.68
     It will not help major injuries such as a meniscal or cartilage tear, ligament tear,
},
{
    70.68,71.92
     anything like that.
},
{
    71.92,73.16
     So don't ask.
},
{
    73.16,74.92
     Go visit your doctor instead.
},
{
    74.92,79.28
     So let's get started with it and get rid of that knee pain for good at home.
},
{
    79.28,82.88
     In the first part, we're going to focus on the soft tissue around the knee, including
},
{
    82.88,85.36
     the cartilage, ligaments, and muscles.
},
{
    85.36,90.52
     This is one of my favorite ways to get rid of muscle and just general tightness around
},
{
    90.52,91.52
     the knee.
},
{
    91.52,96.24
     It's a form of muscle scraping, also known as Gua Sha.
},
{
    96.24,99.28
     What I'm going to be using is coconut oil.
},
{
    99.28,106.66
     You can also substitute this for any massage lotion or you can actually use icy hot bio-freeze,
},
{
    106.66,107.86
     anything like that.
},
{
    107.86,111.36
     We just want something that we can put around the muscles
},
{
    111.36,114.9
     and around the knee to help give a little bit of lubrication
},
{
    114.9,117.86
     and you're going to see here very quickly why.
},
{
    117.86,120.86
     So let's take my lotion, my massage oil,
},
{
    120.86,122.36
     and just coat around the knee
},
{
    122.36,124.2
     or where you're having a lot of discomfort.
},
{
    124.2,128.6
     You're going to want to go on the back of the knee, the sides of the knee, all around the muscles themselves.
},
{
    128.6,133.44
     And then from there what I'm going to do is I'm going to use a butter knife.
},
{
    133.44,138.92
     If you don't have a butter knife a spoon will also work. I'm not going to be using the sharp serrated edge.
},
{
    138.92,143.64
     Instead let's use right here the thickness of the handle itself.
},
{
    143.64,147.8
     You want one that is nice and thick and is also going to be nice and smooth.
},
{
    147.8,152.52
     Let's take a towel right here and just grab over the serrated part just so we don't end
},
{
    152.52,154.84
     up cutting ourselves.
},
{
    154.84,159.24
     Once we have enough lubrication from there, what I'm going to do is simply start to go
},
{
    159.24,162.44
     around the muscles of the knee itself.
},
{
    162.44,167.4
     I put pressure in there to make sure that I'm really getting a good massage, but not too
},
{
    167.4,170.24
     much to the point where it's causing discomfort.
},
{
    170.24,175.32
     I'm going to go first around the quadriceps, that big muscle right up here, and go from
},
{
    175.32,178.16
     here all the way down to the knee itself.
},
{
    178.16,180.04
     Make sure that you have plenty of oil around.
},
{
    180.04,182.76
     If you feel like you don't, just add a little bit more.
},
{
    182.76,188.4
     It's always good to have more lubrication than to have it not pretty much causing a
},
{
    188.4,189.9
     lot of friction in there.
},
{
    189.9,194.32
     When I'm doing this, what you're noticing is a lot of redness is starting to come in.
},
{
    194.32,195.44
     That's the whole point of it.
},
{
    195.44,200.66
     What it's doing is it's bringing blood flow to that soft tissue to help promote healing.
},
{
    200.66,206.4
     If you feel a spot that's just really gritty, stop over that and really just dig in there.
},
{
    206.4,212.0
     Do this for about 5 to 10 seconds, move over to a different spot and do the same thing.
},
{
    212.0,217.0
     But once you do that, also switch directions and hit it at a different angle.
},
{
    217.0,221.14
     You want to go up with it and then you also want to go down with it just to make sure
},
{
    221.14,228.78
     that we're attacking that soft tissue at all angles. But go to the side of the knee, go into the calf muscles right here.
},
{
    228.78,232.34
     Hit the hamstring in the back and also inside the leg
},
{
    232.34,237.9
     and down into the middle of the gastroc or the calf muscle right here.
},
{
    237.9,242.06
     Take the round edge of whatever you're using, the knife right here,
},
{
    242.06,246.4
     and you can also go inside the knees right here where the divots are at. Let's say that you have a lot of pain on the using the knife right here. You can also go inside the knees, right here where the divots are at.
},
{
    246.4,247.68
     Let's say that you have a lot of pain
},
{
    247.68,249.0
     on the inside of the knee.
},
{
    249.0,252.52
     You can use that tool, that butter knife I should say,
},
{
    252.52,255.84
     to really just go in there and dig at that soft tissue.
},
{
    255.84,258.56
     I just like to do five to 10 second holds,
},
{
    258.56,260.2
     attack it at a different angle,
},
{
    260.2,262.8
     and then just make sure to go all around the knee.
},
{
    262.8,264.6
     Great way to be able to go in there
},
{
    264.6,266.96
     and just get a lot of tightness out very quickly.
},
{
    266.96,267.8
     For the second part,
},
{
    267.8,269.92
     we're going to focus on stretching the knee
},
{
    269.92,271.32
     with a light traction.
},
{
    271.32,274.96
     I'm going to show two different exercises that you can use.
},
{
    274.96,277.08
     So give them both a try and go with the one
},
{
    277.08,278.88
     that you feel helps the most.
},
{
    278.88,280.72
     This one is particularly good
},
{
    280.72,282.48
     for people that have a locked up knee,
},
{
    282.48,284.0
     maybe some knee arthritis
},
{
    284.0,286.28
     or just want to help open it up.
},
{
    286.28,291.08
     I'm going to be using two hand drying towels that I rolled up like this.
},
{
    291.08,295.08
     Let's sit on the floor and what I'm going to do is whatever knee that I'm focusing on,
},
{
    295.08,299.04
     in this case it's my right side, I'm going to take that rolled up towel and put it directly
},
{
    299.04,300.96
     behind the knee like this.
},
{
    300.96,304.52
     Let's put the foot flat and then slide it back towards us like this.
},
{
    304.52,305.36
     I take my hands,
},
{
    305.36,310.36
     put it on the shin, and I'm just like a lever bringing the knee back towards me. When you
},
{
    310.36,315.36
     do this, the more that you bring the heel back towards your butt, the more that's going
},
{
    315.36,321.36
     to traction into the knee. Only go to your comfort level. Sometimes you will get a quick
},
{
    321.36,326.04
     pop or crack into the knee. That is completely normal. What I
},
{
    326.04,331.3
     do is once I feel like it's a very good stretch, I hold this position for 15
},
{
    331.3,337.8
     seconds. From there, I just relax and then I'm going to repeat up to five times.
},
{
    337.8,342.2
     Every time that I do this, I try to go a little bit further with it. You're trying
},
{
    342.2,347.76
     to build motion into that knee and it should just give a little bit more. For the second exercise I'm going to take the
},
{
    347.76,352.08
     towel and go lengthwise with it. Let's put it behind the knee that we're focusing on
},
{
    352.08,356.16
     so I'm starting off on the floor with a pillow underneath my knees for extra comfort. I'm
},
{
    356.16,361.88
     going to grab the two ends like this and pull them away from my knees so it's really tight
},
{
    361.88,368.58
     at the back of the knee. And once I do, I'd like to just anchor my fist into the ground or I should say the pillow
},
{
    368.58,369.92
     like this.
},
{
    369.92,373.04
     When we have a lot of tension built up in there so it doesn't feel like there's any
},
{
    373.04,379.56
     slack, what I'm going to do from there is take my butt slowly down towards my ankles.
},
{
    379.56,382.12
     Actually, I just got my knee to release right there.
},
{
    382.12,383.68
     It was a pretty good pop.
},
{
    383.68,385.64
     I just keep going down further and further.
},
{
    385.64,389.16
     You should really feel that knee start to traction open.
},
{
    389.16,391.72
     Only go to your comfort level with it.
},
{
    391.72,394.6
     From there, you want to hold this for 15 seconds.
},
{
    394.6,398.96
     You're just going to relax and then repeat up to five times.
},
{
    398.96,401.0
     And each time going a little bit further with it,
},
{
    401.0,403.84
     just to help build some more motion in there.
},
{
    403.84,408.76
     Great exercise. So if we want to get rid of knee pain for good we have to focus on building
},
{
    408.76,413.68
     strength in and around the knee. I'm going to show you two simple exercises
},
{
    413.68,418.18
     that are going to focus on all of the main muscle groups associated with knee
},
{
    418.18,423.04
     pain including the quadriceps and the hamstrings. These are compound exercises
},
{
    423.04,428.6
     that are great because it's going to also focus on building stability into the knee by helping to
},
{
    428.6,433.36
     improve coordination of those muscles and the soft tissue. First exercise we're
},
{
    433.36,437.58
     going to do what's called a toe tap. I'm taking a hardcover book and placing it
},
{
    437.58,442.92
     under one foot. You can also use a yoga block or anything that is thick and
},
{
    442.92,445.8
     sturdy and won't collapse under your weight.
},
{
    445.8,451.36
     The first part of this exercise, and there's three parts, what I'm going to do is whatever
},
{
    451.36,455.52
     knee that I'm focusing on, that is going to be the one, that foot is going to be on that
},
{
    455.52,456.52
     book.
},
{
    456.52,461.0
     Let's straighten the other leg, and what I'm going to do is just slowly start to bend
},
{
    461.0,464.22
     that knee till the heel touches the floor.
},
{
    464.22,467.9
     When you do this, you're going to feel all of those muscles in the leg around that knee
},
{
    467.9,469.9
     really start to engage.
},
{
    469.9,474.84
     If this is difficult, you can have a chair off to the side right here or use a broomstick
},
{
    474.84,476.34
     to help steady yourself.
},
{
    476.34,482.98
     You want to do just nice, slow, controlled motions, moving only from that knee.
},
{
    482.98,486.6
     When you do this, try to have good upright lower back posture and
},
{
    486.6,493.24
     engage that core to help stabilize everything. I try to do 10 repetitions of this, take a
},
{
    493.24,499.32
     breather, and then from there do another set. The second part, and this one's a little bit
},
{
    499.32,503.4
     harder, what we do is we're going to bend the knee, but instead we're going to take
},
{
    503.4,508.84
     our leg and put it behind us like this and do the same thing. And actually this one's a
},
{
    508.84,513.34
     little bit more tricky even for me. So what I'm doing is just slow nice knee
},
{
    513.34,517.38
     movements and then I'm just trying to take that knee down. And the same thing
},
{
    517.38,522.66
     with this one, 10 repetitions and you're just going to do two sets of this. So if
},
{
    522.66,525.16
     you find that all of these are too easy,
},
{
    525.16,527.08
     try to do an alternating motion.
},
{
    527.08,529.16
     So go back into that first position,
},
{
    529.16,531.4
     and then go back like this.
},
{
    531.4,534.54
     And I tell you what, this takes a lot of coordination
},
{
    534.54,537.52
     into that knee, but it's going to help build strength in there
},
{
    537.52,541.2
     and just get all of those muscles working together
},
{
    541.2,545.0
     to hopefully ward off future instances of knee pain.
},
{
    545.0,550.6
     So a great compound exercise that's going to target a lot, pretty much all the muscles
},
{
    550.6,556.4
     that are associated with knee pain is the squat. Me personally, I think the squat is
},
{
    556.4,562.04
     the premier exercise for building overall lower body health. What I'm going to do
},
{
    562.04,565.64
     first is just use a sturdy chair, one
},
{
    565.64,570.2
     without wheels, and let's slide to the edge of it like this. And then from there
},
{
    570.2,574.68
     let's just stand up. I'm going to position my feet to be shoulder width apart and
},
{
    574.68,578.52
     my toes are going to be slightly angled out about 10 degrees. This will help
},
{
    578.52,581.98
     take a little bit off in these themselves. Let's make sure the low back
},
{
    581.98,587.36
     has very good upright posture. Let's engage the core a little bit. We're going to put our arms out in front of us
},
{
    587.36,592.72
     like this and I'm just going to put my weight on my heels and then slowly start
},
{
    592.72,598.44
     to lower my butt down towards that chair. When you make contact with the chair,
},
{
    598.44,604.4
     drive from the heels and just come back up. Just nice, slow, controlled movements.
},
{
    604.4,606.86
     And when you do this, make sure that
},
{
    606.86,611.84
     your knees don't travel past your toes when you get down to the bottom. Just make a note
},
{
    611.84,617.26
     of that. That should ensure that you have a good center of gravity. Once you're able
},
{
    617.26,628.2
     to do all of this, just do nice, slow, controlled movements for 10 to 15 repetitions. From there, take a breather and do two to three more sets.
},
{
    628.2,633.76
     If you find the box squat a little too easy or you want to focus on one particular knee,
},
{
    633.76,635.0
     this is a good way to do it.
},
{
    635.0,637.36
     This is called a staggered box squat.
},
{
    637.36,641.76
     What I'm going to do is whatever side that I'm focusing on, let's bend the knee at 90
},
{
    641.76,645.56
     degrees while the other leg is just going to go out just very slightly.
},
{
    645.56,650.08
     I'm going to just place my heel directly down into the floor.
},
{
    650.08,651.88
     What I'm going to do is just the same thing.
},
{
    651.88,656.92
     I'm going to come up with it like this and then put my arms out in front of me and slowly
},
{
    656.92,657.92
     come back down.
},
{
    657.92,662.68
     But when you do this, you're going to feel a lot more being placed on that knee that
},
{
    662.68,668.0
     right there is bent. So do 10 to 15 repetitions of this
},
