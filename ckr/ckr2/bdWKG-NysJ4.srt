     Hey there, welcome back to How To Medicaid and welcome to this video on everything you need to
},
{
    12.16,17.28
     know to check yourself for skin cancer. Most importantly, what are the major types of skin
},
{
    17.28,22.08
     cancer and how do you recognize them? And as always, I will bore you with a quick introduction.
},
{
    22.08,26.8
     My name is Rourou, I'm a medical doctor from the Netherlands and I'm making weekly medical videos to educate
},
{
    26.8,31.42
     myself as well as you, my viewer, because I believe that medically educated people make
},
{
    31.42,34.8
     a healthier decisions and that's what this channel is all about.
},
{
    34.8,36.4
     This video also comes with a quick disclaimer.
},
{
    36.4,38.12
     It's meant purely informational.
},
{
    38.12,39.68
     This is not medical advice.
},
{
    39.68,44.4
     And always contact your doctor, especially if you think you might have skin cancer.
},
{
    44.4,45.38
     Go to your doctor, especially if you think you might have skin cancer. Go to your doctor.
},
{
    45.38,50.52
     Now I want to start this video off by educating you on the three main types of skin cancer.
},
{
    50.52,54.62
     Basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and melanomas.
},
{
    54.62,57.66
     Because if you don't know them, you cannot recognize them.
},
{
    57.66,62.34
     These different cancers are named after the cells in which they are developing and carcinoma,
},
{
    62.34,65.12
     as you might have guessed guessed is Latin for cancer.
},
{
    65.12,69.88
     In this picture you see where the basal cells, squamous cells and melanocytes are located
},
{
    69.88,70.88
     in your skin.
},
{
    70.88,73.32
     Now let's take a closer look at each of these cancers.
},
{
    73.32,78.16
     Now we start off with the most common form of skin cancer, a basal cell carcinoma but
},
{
    78.16,81.04
     luckily this is the least dangerous one.
},
{
    81.04,89.6
     Grows very slowly and it spreads very rarely which makes it very easily treatable and not that deadly. Basal cell carcinomas are usually developed in
},
{
    89.6,94.6
     places with a lot of sun exposure so your arms, your head, your torso, these
},
{
    94.6,98.72
     kinds of places as exposure of ultraviolet rays can increase your
},
{
    98.72,102.8
     chances on developing a basal cell carcinoma. And now then the most burning
},
{
    102.8,105.28
     question how can you recognize them?
},
{
    105.28,110.28
     Here I am showing you some examples of a basal cell carcinoma that may appear as a painless
},
{
    110.28,113.8
     raised area of skin, looking dry and scaly.
},
{
    113.8,119.24
     Can be called red or pale and as it drives it may appear ulcerated or look like a sore.
},
{
    119.24,124.16
     And lastly if you look very closely you can see small blood vessels running over it.
},
{
    124.16,125.82
     Next up squamous cell carcinomas.
},
{
    125.82,128.96
     And luckily, they are more rare than a basal cell carcinoma
},
{
    128.96,131.26
     because they develop a little more quickly
},
{
    131.26,133.02
     and they can spread more easily.
},
{
    133.02,135.86
     This makes them harder to treat and more dangerous.
},
{
    135.86,137.98
     It usually develops over several months,
},
{
    137.98,139.58
     but if you recognize it early,
},
{
    139.58,141.1
     your chances improve vastly
},
{
    141.1,143.22
     and the prognosis is usually good.
},
{
    143.22,145.04
     And helping you to do so is the whole point of
},
{
    145.04,151.76
     this video so please leave a like for me trying to save your life. Now let's get back to the
},
{
    151.76,156.88
     question how do you recognize a squamous cell carcinoma? It usually looks like a slow growing
},
{
    156.88,162.48
     hot lump with raised edges and a scaly top. It can also lie below the level of your normal skin
},
{
    162.48,166.4
     and as it grows can evolve in an ulcer or a reddish skin plaque
},
{
    166.4,173.1
     that bleeds very easily and frequently and again if you take a very close look it is covered with tiny blood vessels.
},
{
    173.1,181.4
     As with basal cell carcinomas exposure to UV radiation of the sun can greatly increase your chances on developing a squamous cell carcinoma.
},
{
    181.4,187.96
     Therefore they are found most often in sun exposed areas, the back of your hand, scalp, lip and torso.
},
{
    187.96,189.96
     Lastly, we will cover melanomas,
},
{
    189.96,192.32
     the most dangerous form of skin cancer.
},
{
    192.32,194.96
     It grows very fast, it spreads very early
},
{
    194.96,196.92
     and therefore it's very dangerous.
},
{
    196.92,200.92
     Melanomas develop pigment producing cells called melanocytes
},
{
    200.92,202.8
     and if undetected and untreated,
},
{
    202.8,205.44
     they can be deadly within just a few months.
},
{
    205.44,210.04
     And a melanoma might be developed at parts of your body not normally exposed to sunlight
},
{
    210.04,215.4
     but as with the previous skin cancers exposure to ultraviolet rays might increase your likelihood
},
{
    215.4,217.08
     to actually developing it.
},
{
    217.08,221.84
     Now then the most important question how can you recognize a melanoma and to do this properly
},
{
    221.84,225.06
     you first need to learn how to recognize a normal healthy mole.
},
{
    225.06,231.54
     Moles, also called nevus or nevus cells, are a type of benign which means non-cancerous tumor.
},
{
    231.54,237.06
     These are a type of skin cell containing a lot of pigment. This explains why moles are often brown or black.
},
{
    237.06,241.12
     Now usually you're born with several moles. This is determined genetically.
},
{
    241.12,248.28
     However, they may also appear randomly during your lifetime And for this there seems to be no specific trigger. Here it is important to
},
{
    248.28,252.28
     know that normal moles can have various sizes and characteristics. They can be
},
{
    252.28,256.88
     brown or black, hairless or with a lot of hairs, flat or as a bump on your skin,
},
{
    256.88,260.92
     but usually they're around. And from here it's quite simple to recognize a
},
{
    260.92,265.24
     melanoma. If your mole changes in appearance, if it becomes larger,
},
{
    265.24,269.76
     if it changes in color, if it starts bleeding, or if it becomes painful, then you should
},
{
    269.76,274.4
     contact your doctor. You could also use the following acronym to detect melanomas early
},
{
    274.4,278.92
     A, B, C, D, E, F, which I would trust you remember.
},
{
    278.92,283.72
     A stands for asymmetry and as I told you, normal moles should be round. B stands for
},
{
    283.72,286.6
     borders, are there any irregularities, edges, colonos, moles should be round. B stands for borders. Are there any irregularities?
},
{
    286.6,287.6
     Edges?
},
{
    287.6,288.6
     Colonies?
},
{
    288.6,289.6
     There should be none.
},
{
    289.6,290.6
     C stands for colors.
},
{
    290.6,293.84
     Does your mole have multiple colors which it did not have before?
},
{
    293.84,295.64
     Like red, white or black?
},
{
    295.64,296.64
     D stands for diameter.
},
{
    296.64,299.76
     If your mole becomes larger than 6 millimeters.
},
{
    299.76,301.88
     E stands for revolving over time.
},
{
    301.88,303.2
     Does your mole change?
},
{
    303.2,305.84
     An F stands for funny looking, which basically means
},
{
    305.84,310.48
     that if your mole starts to look funny, then get it checked out. Now I hope this video was clear
},
{
    310.48,315.52
     and I hope you know now how to check yourself for skin cancer. Please share this video with someone
},
{
    315.52,320.64

},
{
    320.64,327.92
