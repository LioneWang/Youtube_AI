     Hi everyone, I hope you guys are keeping well. Today I'm going to talk about
},
{
    7.16,12.78
     blood flow restriction. It's one of the things that has been in the market for
},
{
    12.78,17.82
     a while but a lot of people don't have that much information about it and what
},
{
    17.82,22.64
     are the advantages of using it. Specifically right now because of lockdown
},
{
    22.64,47.32
     in many countries all around the world there is not enough access to the gym and sometimes you might not have enough amount of equipment at home to be able to maintain your muscle mass and be you to actually get the similar effect from your workout and
},
{
    47.6,54.78
     We got basically these from ASHRAE basically and company. I'm gonna leave you a link below and show you
},
{
    55.18,57.18
     basically these and
},
{
    57.7,66.24
     Blood flow restriction tools are how it works. How can you get and benefit from it and especially if you don't have access to the gym
},
{
    66.8,72.56
     and you still would like to have a workout at home, how can you use this at home as one of the
},
{
    72.56,76.4
     things that actually can help you to maintain your muscle mass and help you to build muscle mass.
},
{
    77.76,81.68
     In addition to what I explained to you just now, I would like to let you know,
},
{
    81.68,90.68
     not only when you want to get a good workout, can use this in the in the world of rehab and as a physical therapist and I'm using these and
},
{
    91.12,98.38
     Actually coughs for many of my patients who can't really apply high volume or high intensity load
},
{
    98.6,106.04
     This actually and coughs can help them to get the similar benefit of actually using their body weight,
},
{
    106.04,109.56
     but it can increase the intensity of workout for them,
},
{
    109.56,111.88
     which means it's pretty low impact.
},
{
    111.88,115.92
     And if you had like a literally a very acute surgery
},
{
    115.92,119.84
     or acute injury, you can actually use these
},
{
    119.84,123.56
     as a facilitator for you to actually get the similar benefit
},
{
    123.56,125.28
     as a high intensity load. I'm gonna show you in this box you to actually get the similar benefit as a high-intensity load.
},
{
    129.84,135.36
     I'm going to show you in this box what you actually get. If you purchase these, basically there's four basically cuffs that you can use them for upper body and lower body,
},
{
    135.36,141.28
     like literally at the same times or usually either for upper body or lower body. And there is a
},
{
    141.28,145.36
     basically a pump here that you can actually measure your pressure.
},
{
    145.36,150.92
     It's pretty slick and clean and tidy and the way that they design these cuffs and
},
{
    150.92,154.12
     I actually really like this because I've never seen something similar in the market.
},
{
    154.12,159.48
     The way that you can actually adjust them is very clean and tidy. It's click-in and you can
},
{
    159.48,164.76
     actually see the pressure straight away and there's a basically kind of like adjuster here
},
{
    164.76,166.78
     that you can adjust the pressure.
},
{
    166.78,171.42
     Let me show you how you can actually adjust this on your let's say upper body and you
},
{
    171.42,174.66
     can give it a try.
},
{
    174.66,180.38
     Alright guys, we presume that you want to do an upper body basically workout and you
},
{
    180.38,186.12
     can literally open this and the head of this pump should be always looked down.
},
{
    186.12,190.64
     You can literally start to wrap it as high to the limb
},
{
    190.64,193.44
     as possible, which means if you're using your arm,
},
{
    193.44,195.72
     like literally you want to get it as close as possible
},
{
    195.72,199.68
     to your armpit, and you don't wanna make this too tight,
},
{
    199.68,202.16
     it actually should be kinda like a little bit loose
},
{
    202.16,204.12
     that you'd be able to move it,
},
{
    204.12,205.88
     because as soon as you start the pump
},
{
    206.2,209.2
     you can actually increase that pressure and
},
{
    210.56,217.04
     adjust it. Now when you're putting it in one side you can straight away this adjuster can
},
{
    217.52,221.88
     click in very clean and tidy and you basically close this
},
{
    222.44,225.76
     adjuster and you start the pump. As soon as you start the pump,
},
{
    225.76,230.76
     you can actually see the pressure of the coughs,
},
{
    231.04,231.96
     how far it is.
},
{
    231.96,236.96
     What is suggest on the manual between 120 to 140, 180,
},
{
    238.08,241.7
     the pressure would be ideal while you're doing your workout.
},
{
    241.7,248.58
     But at the same time, I would suggest you to check and and see and you shouldn't feel too much pressure or feel numb or tingling
},
{
    248.58,252.84
     to your hands while you're actually bending your arms or your leg which
},
{
    252.84,256.58
     means you already can feel a slight pressure and that's exactly what we're
},
{
    256.58,259.86
     looking for. Now you don't need to do anything as soon as you find out the
},
{
    259.86,265.18
     pressure is good you can basically press that and it's actually ready to go.
},
{
    265.18,269.06
     Now, as you can see immediately after getting it there,
},
{
    269.06,270.94
     you can see all the veins are out
},
{
    270.94,273.66
     and you can feel that actually pressure is on.
},
{
    273.66,276.1
     That exactly what you're looking for.
},
{
    276.1,279.5
     All right guys, to show you what can you do with these coughs
},
{
    279.5,282.42
     and I'll prepare you a short body weight workout
},
{
    282.42,284.3
     and I've included some free weights
},
{
    284.3,286.8
     and resistance band into it to show you
},
{
    286.8,288.28
     how you can give it a try
},
{
    288.28,290.08
     and get benefit from these calves.
},
{
    290.08,293.64
     You can also add on free weights into it if you like to,
},
{
    293.64,297.2
     but what research and study recommend is to use
},
{
    297.2,299.92
     and basically 20 to 30% of your maximum strength
},
{
    299.92,302.08
     when you're using the basically calves
},
{
    302.08,304.48
     for getting the similar advantages.
},
{
    304.48,305.6
     But there's no
},
{
    305.6,309.48
     harm to go heavier on that that's not a problem now if you're interested to get
},
{
    309.48,313.56
