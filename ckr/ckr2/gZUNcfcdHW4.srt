     Hey everybody, it's Doctor Jo and today I'm going to show you some stretches and exercises for cervical radiculopathy. Let's get started.
},
{
    14.6,16.8
     So if you have this you know it's pretty
},
{
    17.44,21.52
     ridiculous and you want to get rid of that pain because it's nerve pain. Basically what
},
{
    21.8,26.08
     radiculopathy is is the nerve root at the spine gets inflamed
},
{
    26.08,30.8
     and irritated and then it causes that pain usually down the arm or if it's in the lower
},
{
    30.8,36.0
     body down the leg. So to start off with we're just going to do some nerve glides. With nerve
},
{
    36.0,41.6
     glides remember you just want to do a little bit maybe 10 just one time a day because if you do too
},
{
    41.6,48.4
     many it'll flare up the nerve even more and that's definitely what you don't want. So to start off with take the arm and put
},
{
    48.4,54.2
     it almost up into a stop sign position but turn your palm facing you and what
},
{
    54.2,58.08
     you're gonna do is imagine that there's a string on your finger and your head so
},
{
    58.08,62.92
     they follow each other. So basically you're gonna pull your head over and
},
{
    62.92,65.12
     straighten your arm out and then come
},
{
    65.12,69.68
     back in. Try and keep your head in a straightforward position. Don't turn
},
{
    69.68,74.64
     towards it but keep it straight ahead and then just side bend over and follow
},
{
    74.64,79.44
     that hand going down and coming back up. So again just start off with ten of
},
{
    79.44,82.56
     these. I wouldn't recommend any more because it might flare it up a little
},
{
    82.56,88.22
     bit more. Then you're gonna go into some stretching and do a trap stretch and that's those muscles
},
{
    88.22,92.4
     back here where if they get tight they they pull in and put pressure on that
},
{
    92.4,96.08
     spine and put pressure on the nerves. So for the trap stretch if I'm stretching
},
{
    96.08,101.2
     my right side I'm going to put my hand down. Some people put it behind their back.
},
{
    101.2,108.64
     You can do that if you're sitting in a chair it helps to kind of grab on the bottom of the chair because then that kind of stabilizes the shoulder because you don't want
},
{
    108.64,114.96
     your shoulder coming up, you want it to stay down. And then take your opposite hand and then just pull
},
{
    114.96,121.44
     away and hold that stretch for 30 seconds. So you should feel that stretch right in through there
},
{
    121.44,125.28
     and just nice hold. See if I'm not holding on that shoulder comes
},
{
    125.28,128.64
     up a little bit and it's not terrible but then I'm not getting quite as much
},
{
    128.64,131.8
     of a stretch. So make sure you kind of pull it down. You can just take your
},
{
    131.8,136.6
     fist and push it down as well. Holding that for 30 seconds and then doing that
},
{
    136.6,141.68
     three times. If you want to do both sides you can as well. The next one is
},
{
    141.68,149.9
     going to be a chin tuck and we've talked about chin tucks in the past where it's not tucking down towards your chest,
},
{
    149.9,155.7
     but it's actually tucking it in, making a whole lot of little chins there.
},
{
    155.7,158.8
     So the goal is to make a whole bunch of wrinkles right there.
},
{
    158.8,165.46
     So what I like to do is kind of use my finger as a target just so I know that I'm actually retracting that chin
},
{
    165.46,169.84
     back. So just starting here and then it's almost like I'm trying to take the back
},
{
    169.84,175.18
     of my head towards my other hand. So just scrunching in getting lots of little
},
{
    175.18,180.7
     chins there but keeping that chin up. Hold it for about three to five seconds
},
{
    180.7,188.32
     and then relax and you can see that there's a space now between my finger and my chin and I moved it a little bit but you can tell that there's
},
{
    188.32,194.04
     a difference there and then move it again and retract and hold it there three
},
{
    194.04,199.56
     to five seconds and do about five of those. Then the next one is going to be
},
{
    199.56,208.0
     the chin retraction with a little bit of an extension and And remember with extension if you have neck issues anyways sometimes this
},
{
    208.0,212.64
     movement for people makes you dizzy or very painful so don't feel like you have
},
{
    212.64,215.44
     to do a lot you're just getting that movement. So you're
},
{
    215.44,222.08
     going to do that chin retraction first and then just an up and down
},
{
    222.08,227.3
     while you're retracted. So you can try and do about five at a time
},
{
    227.3,230.46
     while you're retracted or relax each time.
},
{
    230.46,232.24
     Cause sometimes it's hard cause you haven't worked
},
{
    232.24,233.46
     those muscles in a while.
},
{
    233.46,236.54
     People tend to get that forward head posture
},
{
    236.54,239.4
     and then these become weak, these become tight.
},
{
    239.4,243.88
     So you might have to do one chin tuck, go up, relax.
},
{
    243.88,247.12
     But if you can hold it and do about five at a
},
{
    247.12,252.24
     time, that's the best. And then do two sets of five. So there you have it. Those were
},
{
    252.24,256.28
     your stretches for cervical radiculopathy. If you have any questions, leave them in

    256.28,261.32
