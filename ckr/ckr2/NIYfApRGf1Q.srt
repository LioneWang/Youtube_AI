     Hi everybody, this is Dr. Tahir again at Family Pediatrics. Thank you so much for joining us today.
},
{
    5.2,8.84
     We have cute little Holden and Katie and we have Phil with us today and
},
{
    9.68,12.72
     Holden came in today with ear pain and he has an ear infection.
},
{
    13.48,18.24
     With the type of ear infection that he has, I'll need to give him some antibiotics and some pain medicine.
},
{
    18.48,26.56
     But along with that, I want to teach you a special massage technique that will help drain the fluid inside his ear into his
},
{
    26.56,31.36
     throat. There's a small tube that we have that connects the ear to the back of the throat. It's
},
{
    31.36,38.16
     called the Eustachian tube. And that you can get clogged sometimes. And that can also make the fluid
},
{
    38.16,46.44
     build up in our ear. Okay, so the massage technique I'll show you, it's kind of a technique to help pump that tube a little bit,
},
{
    46.44,49.08
     to hopefully help that drain a little better.
},
{
    49.08,52.48
     Along with using the antibiotics or any decongestants
},
{
    52.48,55.4
     that he may be using, that massage technique
},
{
    55.4,57.44
     may also help to decrease some of that fluid
},
{
    57.44,58.64
     and pressure inside.
},
{
    58.64,59.64
     Sounds good?
},
{
    59.64,61.32
     All right, so what you'll want to do
},
{
    61.32,64.36
     is for doing the little massage technique,
},
{
    64.36,67.32
     you want to use some kind of an oil for him.
},
{
    67.32,73.36
     The easiest one to use is simple plain organic olive oil, extra virgin olive oil.
},
{
    73.36,76.36
     Same exact oil that we eat and cook with.
},
{
    76.36,79.16
     Okay, so you know it's safe to use on his skin also.
},
{
    79.16,85.64
     So I have some of that here and I'm going to bring that over and put a little bit on my finger okay.
},
{
    91.84,99.0
     Alright, Holden are you ready? Isn't this fun? Are you excited? Holden is super
},
{
    99.0,103.28
     excited too. So what you'll do is use a little bit of oil and here I'm just
},
{
    103.28,105.24
     gonna put this on a little cotton ball but at home you is use a little bit of oil. And here I'm just going to put this on a little cotton ball.
},
{
    105.24,110.88
     But at home, you can use a little bowl or disposable cup
},
{
    110.88,112.16
     or something like that.
},
{
    112.16,116.88
     I'm just going to put this here so that I can motion my thumb
},
{
    116.88,117.84
     with this.
},
{
    117.84,119.88
     I'm not going to put my thumb on there or in there,
},
{
    119.88,121.28
     so it stays clean.
},
{
    121.28,121.8
     All right.
},
{
    121.8,123.12
     So what you'll want to do is you'll
},
{
    123.12,125.88
     want to use your thumb for the massage.
},
{
    125.88,129.28
     And you notice there's not too much oil on my finger.
},
{
    129.28,131.8
     If you look at my finger close up,
},
{
    131.8,134.52
     there's hardly much oil there.
},
{
    134.52,135.84
     You don't need dripping oil.
},
{
    135.84,140.24
     You just need a little oil so your finger slides on his skin
},
{
    140.24,143.76
     and it doesn't create heat and friction.
},
{
    143.76,145.04
     And that's all you're doing.
},
{
    145.04,146.08
     I'm gonna put a little more,
},
{
    146.08,149.4
     because my fingers are a little dry, I think, there.
},
{
    150.84,154.08
     All right, so what you'll wanna do is,
},
{
    155.04,156.28
     hold it, honey, can you move your head
},
{
    156.28,157.96
     just like that for me, sweetheart?
},
{
    157.96,158.96
     Perfect.
},
{
    158.96,161.72
     So it's this ear that we're looking at.
},
{
    161.72,164.76
     And what you wanna do is feel right behind his ear,
},
{
    164.76,165.64
     and you'll feel a bone
},
{
    165.64,172.08
     right back over here. Go ahead and feel that. And also feel his jaw right over here. That's
},
{
    172.08,178.08
     his jaw bone. Now he's got a couple of different kinds of ear infections going on. He's got
},
{
    178.08,182.64
     the outer ear infection going on which is more painful. And the middle ear infection
},
{
    182.64,185.58
     going on. Most kids have only one type but
},
{
    185.58,190.08
     he has both. So we're going to be very gentle with him so we don't cause him any discomfort.
},
{
    190.08,194.04
     Okay sweetheart, go like this for me. What you'll be doing is you'll be using your thumb,
},
{
    194.04,201.76
     starting from up here on top of his ear and right behind his ear and you're going to gently
},
{
    201.76,206.0
     press down and pull your thumb down and kind of go
},
{
    206.0,210.56
     around his lower jaw that's his lower jaw and that's the bone so you're not
},
{
    210.56,214.0
     gonna press on the bone that's not gonna do any good but it's in between this
},
{
    214.0,217.56
     bone and the lower jaw so it's like a little groove that you'll put your thumb
},
{
    217.56,222.44
     into and gently move your thumb down like that just about you don't have to go
},
{
    222.44,228.64
     all the way further down just in that direction. I'm going to do this five times five or ten times and then
},
{
    228.64,234.08
     repeat that a few times a day. Just like that okay. For him we're being very
},
{
    234.08,240.12
     gentle. If kids have an outer ear infection like he does it maybe that it
},
{
    240.12,242.76
     doesn't help with the outer ear infection it's more for middle ear
},
{
    242.76,245.4
     infection. It just so happens he's got both,
},
{
    245.4,246.84
     but this is for middle ear infection.
},
{
    246.84,249.52
     That's what helps the draining like that.
},
{
    249.52,251.24
     All right.
},
{
    251.24,254.76
     Does it feel okay, sweetheart?
},
{
    254.76,256.16
     OK, do you want to try that?
},
{
    256.16,258.12
     And just see if you can get the one up.
},
{
    258.12,262.8
     See, make sure you get to the right part of the groove
},
{
    262.8,266.32
     and that it's in between the bony areas, not on top of the bones.
},
{
    267.44,274.24
     And so it's, yeah, and it's perfect to be right behind them just like you're sitting.
},
{
    274.96,277.2
     And that's a perfect position too.
},
{
    279.92,284.08
     Good. So you're straight ahead of this bone and behind the lower jaw.
},
{
    284.3,286.3
     good so you stay ahead of this bone and behind the lower jaw.
},
{
    287.4,287.8
     Just like that, okay?
},
{
    291.4,293.9
     And just gentle with him because he's got the outer infection too, so it may be more tender for him, but he's doing well.
},
{
    293.9,295.9
     So go ahead and try that about 10 times.
},
{
    296.3,297.7
     Do that about three times a day.
},
{
    298.2,303.1
     And that helps the drainage so you're doing something along with all the medications that we have to use.
},
{
    303.1,303.7
     Sounds good?
},
{
    304.3,305.04
     Wonderful. Any
},
{
    305.04,310.96
     questions you guys? Wonderful. You're very welcome. Hope it feels good. Hope it gets better for you
},
{
    310.96,316.24
     very soon and if there's any problems just give me a call. Alright so I hope you guys enjoyed that
},
{
    316.24,321.76
     and have a new technique to try for your children if they're suffering from an ear infection and
},
{
    321.76,None
     I'll talk to you guys later.
},
