{
    0.0,4.08
     Hey everybody it's Doctor Jo and today I'm going to show you how to use a TENS EMS unit
},
{
    4.08,7.96
     for elbow pain like tennis elbow or golfers elbow.
},
{
    7.96,8.96
     So let's get started.
},
{
    8.96,14.32
     Disclaimer alert, disclaimer alert!
},
{
    14.32,21.12
     The folks at HealthMateForever sent me their Pro18AB and their W19 which is the wireless
},
{
    21.12,22.12
     one.
},
{
    22.12,25.34
     So it's really cool because if you are putting it on an
},
{
    25.34,29.86
     area your elbow or even your back your knee and you want to go somewhere it's
},
{
    29.86,33.42
     nice that you don't have all that wiring. But you can use this unit with the
},
{
    33.42,37.38
     wiring ones as well. So I'm going to show you both for the elbow but we'll start
},
{
    37.38,41.14
     off with the wireless one. And so the wireless like I said is really cool
},
{
    41.14,46.04
     because you can kind of stick it on and you don't have a whole bunch of other stuff with you.
},
{
    46.04,52.26
     So these are the little wireless buttons here and they go on with specific pads.
},
{
    52.26,59.28
     So the pad comes with it and the coolest part is you can get two and it will control two.
},
{
    59.28,67.52
     So I'm just going to show you with the one because they come in sets of one. And so you just kind of snap it on
},
{
    67.52,71.44
     like that and make sure you have everything off while you're getting it set up. And then
},
{
    71.44,77.28
     this little piece just connects into the wireless approved one. So there's a bunch of different
},
{
    77.28,83.12
     units that have the wireless so you can make sure that it has the wireless icon and then
},
{
    83.12,89.6
     you just plug that in right there and then they'll talk to each other. So if you're interested in purchasing any of the 10 CMS units you can
},
{
    89.6,95.04
     just click on the link up there. So once you get everything kind of connected in, still don't turn
},
{
    95.04,101.12
     it on yet, you're going to put it on and then we'll turn everything on. So I'm going to show you kind
},
{
    101.12,106.3
     of set up for the tennis elbow but it would be the same for the golfers elbow or even something like
},
{
    106.44,109.8
     triceps tendonitis if you had something going on with your elbow there as well.
},
{
    109.9,114.26
     So you can put the electrode or the pad on a couple different ways.
},
{
    114.44,120.18
     You can wrap it around like this kind of right on that lateral epicondyle or the medial epicondyle.
},
{
    120.18,124.32
     But I found for me personally, I liked it a little bit better longer
},
{
    124.74,127.14
     because it not only covers the epicondyle
},
{
    127.14,132.38
     Where all those tendons come in attached where that irritation is but it comes down into the muscle belly a little bit too
},
{
    132.42,137.04
     So for the tins you really want to do that because that's going to help with that pain
},
{
    137.16,142.94
     So with the tins it really is for pain control and to increase circulation
},
{
    142.94,145.28
     So tins is different than the EMS.
},
{
    145.28,149.04
     Tins is that transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation.
},
{
    149.04,151.22
     So it's just getting those surface nerves.
},
{
    151.22,152.92
     So if you have a contraction,
},
{
    152.92,155.52
     if you see a muscle contraction, like a big contraction,
},
{
    155.52,158.62
     when you're doing the tins, it's either on too high
},
{
    158.62,161.0
     or your placement isn't quite right.
},
{
    161.0,163.72
     For a contraction, you wanna use the EMS,
},
{
    163.72,167.92
     the electrical muscle stimulation, because they are different currents. So even though you can get a
},
{
    167.92,171.28
     contraction with the tins, you should really use the EMS if that's what you're
},
{
    171.28,175.28
     using, because for the tins you want it to be relaxing, you want it to be
},
{
    175.28,178.44
     comfortable, you don't want it to be super painful, and when you're trying to get
},
{
    178.44,182.0
     the muscle contraction with the EMS it's pretty uncomfortable and sometimes just
},
{
    182.0,185.26
     a little bit painful. So once you get it set up,
},
{
    189.18,191.7
     then there's a little on button here that you're going to turn on to turn this piece on and then you're going to turn the unit on.
},
{
    191.94,196.66
     And so you can see here that it has the little red light that's on and then the
},
{
    196.66,198.78
     green light came on saying it was wireless.
},
{
    199.02,202.22
     And then the blue is on for the channel A.
},
{
    202.42,205.48
     If you want to do channel B, you just hit the middle
},
{
    205.48,211.08
     button. So if I had to, they both could be on A and then you just have to use A.
},
{
    211.08,215.72
     Or if you wanted it maybe stronger here and less here, you could do channel A
},
{
    215.72,220.68
     and then channel B and then increase the intensity separately for each one. So
},
{
    220.68,223.76
     that's kind of a nice component as well because you might want it a little bit
},
{
    223.76,229.4
     stronger on the muscle belly versus right at the bone joint. So it's a nice kind of
},
{
    229.4,234.96
     component to be able to do it that way. So it works just the same with the TENS EMS that
},
{
    234.96,241.36
     once you get everything set up, the top ones here are more for the TENS and then there's
},
{
    241.36,249.04
     some that will lower down for the EMS and we'll talk about that in just a second. So a lot of times people say, well, which one should, which setting, which mode should I use?
},
{
    249.04,252.72
     You know, they, they give you a lot of choices and some people might tell you
},
{
    253.16,256.46
     this one's for this way frequency. You should use this one this way.
},
{
    256.46,262.9
     But honestly, I really think whatever one is most comfortable for you because TENS is supposed to make it feel better.
},
{
    262.9,268.52
     It's supposed to be comfortable, maybe a little painful, but that good hurt, not just hurt hurt. So I
},
{
    268.52,272.84
     would go through each mode and just try it a little bit. So with this one you
},
{
    272.84,277.24
     just hit the M and that changes the mode and the plus and minus is the
},
{
    277.24,282.44
     intensity and the T is just for the timer up top there. So once I get to a
},
{
    282.44,285.28
     different mode I just start pressing it and even just one I can feel it there. So once I get to a different mode, I just start pressing it and
},
{
    285.28,290.68
     even just one, I can feel it there. So as you can look and see, there's no muscle
},
{
    290.68,294.88
     contraction there and maybe that's just not the one I like. This one's just kind
},
{
    294.88,298.96
     of almost like it's just kind of poking at me. So I'm just gonna move on to the
},
{
    298.96,303.76
     next one and then you each time you move it, it starts back over with intensity,
},
{
    303.76,305.12
     which is nice because then you don't end up, it starts back over with intensity, which is nice because
},
{
    305.12,310.12
     then you don't end up having it higher on one and then it jumping really high to the
},
{
    310.12,311.12
     next one.
},
{
    311.12,313.2
     So it kind of starts over with that, which is nice.
},
{
    313.2,316.44
     I'm going to go back to the first one here and I'm going to start turning it up a little
},
{
    316.44,317.44
     bit.
},
{
    317.44,321.0
     And so I'm going to see if I can get a muscle contraction and just show you what I'm talking
},
{
    321.0,328.4
     about with the tins because you can, especially if you don't have a lot of tissue in that area, but again if you're using it for a
},
{
    328.4,331.94
     tin, it really shouldn't be contracting or that muscle shouldn't be jumping
},
{
    331.94,336.2
     because then you're just fatiguing the muscle out. So there we go. I don't know
},
{
    336.2,339.68
     if you can see that a little bit, but there's a little bit of a contraction
},
{
    339.68,343.96
     there and so that's definitely too much. So I would just either take it back down
},
{
    343.96,345.36
     again to that cup
},
{
    345.6,348.08
     Comfort level because that was a little bit painful
},
{
    348.4,350.68
     Or if I needed to move that
},
{
    351.08,353.08
     Electropad I could just sell a little bit
},
{
    353.38,361.44
     So that's that's really cool. And then if I wanted to do the EMS if I wanted to get that muscle contraction the settings here
},
{
    361.88,369.2
     There is the ones for strengthening. Usually either has a person doing barbells
},
{
    369.2,370.8
     or actually just barbells here.
},
{
    370.8,372.52
     And so that's mode 10.
},
{
    372.52,374.72
     So I'm gonna take it to mode 10
},
{
    374.72,378.08
     and just show you really quickly the EMS,
},
{
    378.08,380.6
     which is the electrical muscle stimulation.
},
{
    380.6,384.84
     So for this, you really do wanna get it on the muscle belly.
},
{
    384.84,385.0
     So let's say I wanted to to get it on the muscle belly. So
},
{
    385.0,389.44
     let's say I wanted to now work those wrist extensors. This is probably
},
{
    389.44,392.84
     something you want to do later if they're really irritated. You don't want to
},
{
    392.84,397.0
     do this in the beginning, but these extensors come through here this way. So
},
{
    397.0,400.88
     I might even put it just a little bit higher where that bulk of that muscle is.
},
{
    400.88,409.76
     And if you pull your wrist up sometimes you can find that bulk right there and then once you get it nice and set up I'm on the electrical
},
{
    409.76,414.4
     muscle stimulation and then again I just start taking it up. So with this one for
},
{
    414.4,418.0
     the for the muscle stimulation it is going to be painful it's going to be
},
{
    418.0,422.08
     really uncomfortable so what you want to do is you want to go until you get a
},
{
    422.08,429.24
     really strong contraction you see how my hand just came up? I didn't actively do that. That was done by the the and see how it
},
{
    429.24,433.68
     just dropped down? I'm not doing that. That's the EMS doing it. So when you get
},
{
    433.68,438.08
     to that point it's working those muscles and it's a little uncomfortable
},
{
    438.08,442.16
     now. It's tolerable but you really want it to be strong. So I say go as high as
},
{
    442.16,450.28
     you comfortably can and then try and click one more to get that extra strengthening in there. But make sure
},
{
    450.28,456.2
     when you're using the EMS especially but the TENS as well if you have had an
},
{
    456.2,460.08
     injury especially if you've had a surgery make sure you talk with your
},
{
    460.08,464.8
     healthcare professional, your doctor, your physical therapist, you know to make
},
{
    464.8,468.32
     sure that it's okay to use because there are some injuries, there are some
},
{
    468.32,472.64
     conditions that you might have where you shouldn't use a TENS or DMS unit, so
},
{
    472.64,476.36
     just make sure that you're using it appropriately how you're supposed to. So
},
{
    476.36,480.4
     now I'm going to show you how to use the TENS with the wired ones. So it's nice
},
{
    480.4,485.52
     because with the wired ones you have two channels. So one channel has
},
{
    485.52,489.96
     two electrodes and then the two channels have four electrodes. So what's really
},
{
    489.96,496.96
     nice about that is let's say your elbow pain is the whole elbow. So maybe it's
},
{
    496.96,500.96
     tennis elbow, maybe a scoffers elbow, maybe it's just the whole elbow hurts. So
},
{
    500.96,505.64
     four electrodes would be better because you can kind of get more area with the four electrodes.
},
{
    505.72,511.64
     So what I would do with that is when you have four, you want each channel to cross.
},
{
    511.8,517.52
     So if I have this first channel, I want it to be one on this side and one on that side.
},
{
    517.52,523.0
     I don't want them just to be here and then them there because then they're not gonna cross and get that whole area.
},
{
    523.0,531.32
     So I would just kind of get the whole general area kind of here and then cross this one up on
},
{
    531.32,538.44
     top maybe over here and then same thing that I would take the channel to with
},
{
    538.44,542.04
     the other electrodes and now cross it the other way. So then I'm getting that
},
{
    542.04,545.76
     cross channel so it's really getting that whole elbow area.
},
{
    548.56,553.92
     And the cool thing with tins is the placement doesn't have to be exact. When you're doing the EMS
},
{
    553.92,558.64
     it should be a little bit more exact because you're going on the muscle belly. But with the tins you're
},
{
    558.64,563.52
     really just trying to get the general area for the pain. So you can see here once again these are
},
{
    563.52,566.04
     crossing and then these are crossing here.
},
{
    566.04,573.32
     So when you turn it back on you want to go back to the 10 settings and that's usually those first ones and then
},
{
    573.5,576.0
     just start bringing it up.
},
{
    578.2,579.54
     And so
},
{
    579.54,581.98
     again, you really shouldn't be having a
},
{
    582.52,588.88
     contraction in there and so it should be comfortable, you know, a little bit slightly uncomfortable but not painful.
},
{
    588.88,593.34
     You know, this is to really just kind of get everything nice and relaxed. So that
},
{
    593.34,596.94
     would be the way you do it. Now let's say you wanted to get a little bit more
},
{
    596.94,601.7
     specific, you know, maybe if it was this time the golfer's elbow, it would still be
},
{
    601.7,608.96
     the same setup on the outside but we're gonna go with the golfer's elbow. It would still be the same setup on the outside, but we're going to go with the golfer's elbow on the inside here. So I'm just going to take one channel off
},
{
    612.16,614.16
     and then use the other channel.
},
{
    617.28,623.92
     Find which one that was and then use the other one to get that specific area.
},
{
    624.0,629.5
     use the other one to get that specific area.
},
{
    632.0,634.0
     So if I wanted to get a little more specific, let's say it was hurting right there.
},
{
    634.0,637.0
     So this time, if you're just using one channel
},
{
    637.0,640.0
     with two electrodes and they're a little bit closer,
},
{
    640.0,642.5
     this will make it a little bit stronger.
},
{
    642.5,645.04
     So that's really just going to be a little more
},
{
    645.04,651.12
     concentrated to that area. So if it's hurting here, I want that one channel just to be talking to each
},
{
    651.12,655.92
     of those electrodes back and forth like that. And then so same thing, you just kind of start
},
{
    656.48,661.28
     bringing it up. Now you can see here, see what's happening? I'm not doing that, it's kind of pulling
},
{
    661.28,668.84
     forward because I've got it just in a little bit of a spot where it's picking up that nerve. So all you have to do is just take take the
},
{
    668.84,673.14
     power back down a little bit and just move it a little bit in a different
},
{
    673.14,676.76
     spot. So that was probably just hitting that ulnar nerve a little bit and
},
{
    676.76,681.04
     getting that going. So then you just move it and then start over again and see. So
},
{
    681.04,686.72
     now now it's not doing that but I'm feeling that tin's vibration going and that
},
{
    686.72,694.48
     feels pretty good. So that's how you do it with one channel versus two. And so you can get the wired
},
{
    694.48,698.64
     if you're just kind of sitting around hanging out and if you want to use the wireless it's cool
},
{
    698.64,702.96
     because then you can kind of slap it on and especially if you have you know a sleeve over it
},
{
    702.96,706.16
     nobody even knows this there it's in your pocket and you can go about doing your thing.
},
{
    706.16,708.42
     And again, you can put it on your back,
},
{
    708.42,709.88
     you can put it on your knee,
},
{
    709.88,711.08
     maybe even down at your ankle
},
{
    711.08,713.3
     so you don't have the wires coming all the way up.
},
{
    713.3,716.44
     So it's really neat to have that wireless option.
},
{
    716.44,718.42
     So if you're interested in purchasing
},
{
    718.42,720.64
