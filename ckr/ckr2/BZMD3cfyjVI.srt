     In this tutorial we're going to look at the treatment for strains and sprains.

    13.52,18.0
     Our treatment for strain or sprain is we use the acronym rice.
},
{
    18.0,23.28
     You rest the injured limb, you place ice on it, you put a compression bandage on it and
},
{
    23.28,28.0
     you elevate it. ice on it, you put a compression bandage on it and your elevators. Our casualty here, I'm going to expose the injured limb.
},
{
    28.0,38.0
     I'm going to use my kit bag here and I'm going to elevate the limb.
},
{
    38.0,43.72
     Next thing I want to put some ice on it.
},
{
    43.72,47.38
     So when we use an ice pack, we never put it directly on the skin we
},
{
    47.38,53.6
     always use a bandage. Here I have my instant ice pack, I got the break,
},
{
    53.6,65.88
     distribute the content speed in it. Now I'm going to wrap it up and now I'm going to place this over the injury.
},
{
    65.88,71.68
     I'm going to leave this here for 10 minutes to cool down the injury and also help reduce
},
{
    71.68,72.68
     swelling.
},
{
    72.68,81.64
     After 10 minutes, next I want to use a compression bandage to put compression or apply pressure
},
{
    81.64,87.68
     over the injury. They come with a clip, we want to discard a clip and
},
{
    87.68,98.08
     we'll use tape to secure it. So you start above the joint, secure your bandage, you
},
{
    98.08,110.04
     come down and we want to do a figure of eight around the injury and back up and we're going to keep doing this. We're going to use the hole of the bandage and keep it good and tight.
},
{
    110.04,114.64
     So continue doing our figure eight. As you will notice as we're doing it, the heel
},
{
    114.64,120.64
     is what remain exposed but we're keeping good pressure on the injury to keep the
},
{
    120.64,127.0
     pressure on the joint.
},
{
    133.28,136.12
     So once you come to the end of your bandage,
},
{
    136.12,139.72
     again you want to use the whole of the bandage.
},
{
    139.72,143.4
     I want to secure it here around the ankle.
},
{
    143.4,145.64
     Again, open fully, and again I want to use
},
{
    145.64,151.6
     two pieces of tape to secure the bandage in place.
},
{
    154.84,158.96
     Now that's part of the treatment so you need to get the leg elevated and as you
},
{
    158.96,163.12
     can see it's elevated here on my kit bag and that is the treatment for a spray
},
{
    163.12,165.72
     in our strain. on my kit bag and that is treatment for spraying or spraying.
