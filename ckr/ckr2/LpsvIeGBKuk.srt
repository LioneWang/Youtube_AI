    0.0,7.0
     I'm here with Tonantitan.com.
},
{
    7.0,10.0
     Got my lovely assistant and beautiful wife here with me.
},
{
    10.0,11.0
     This is Camille.
},
{
    11.0,15.24
     Camille is actually the inspiration behind most of the workouts and things that I share
},
{
    15.24,16.24
     on Tonantitan.
},
{
    16.24,18.16
     So I'm stoked that she's here today.
},
{
    18.16,22.04
     Today we're talking about diastasis recti, or diastasis recti.
},
{
    22.04,24.12
     I've heard it said both ways.
},
{
    24.12,26.52
     Something that is maybe a common topic,
},
{
    26.52,30.68
     especially amongst new mothers and people like that.
},
{
    30.68,35.08
     And so we recently welcomed a new baby into our home
},
{
    35.08,36.64
     and she's about six week old.
},
{
    36.64,38.88
     And so Camille, earlier this week,
},
{
    38.88,41.8
     had her six week appointment with her doctor
},
{
    41.8,44.44
     and he cleared her to start working out again
},
{
    44.44,45.2
     and to kind of to resume
},
{
    45.6,51.04
     some normal exercise, some normal activity. So she's pretty stoked about that. So she came to me
},
{
    51.04,57.2
     and she said, you know, Jer, my abs are shocked. Like I have no abs going on right now. Which happens,
},
{
    57.2,63.44
     right? I mean like six weeks ago she had a child inside of there. It's to be expected, right? And
},
{
    63.44,65.24
     so she kind of came to me and said,
},
{
    65.24,68.84
     hey, what are some some ab moves that I can do? What are some things? What are some what
},
{
    68.84,72.24
     are some exercises I can do? And I said, you know, first things first, like, you know,
},
{
    72.24,76.48
     let's just check and see. Let's clear you to make sure that we're good to resume this,
},
{
    76.48,81.0
     you know, normal workout routine that you've done in the past. And so I wanted to check
},
{
    81.0,87.2
     her for diastasis rectae. And so I thought it would be cool if maybe we could show all you guys how to do that as well.
},
{
    87.2,92.0
     Again, just something that's important to do before jumping back into a normal workout routine.
},
{
    92.0,95.36
     Okay? And so what I'm going to have Camille do is she's going to lay down on her back.
},
{
    96.56,100.4
     While she's doing that, let me just say it's important to note. Yeah, it's important to note that
},
{
    101.04,106.2
     before we do any of this, make sure that you get clearance from your doctor.
},
{
    106.2,111.2
     Six weeks is kind of the unwritten norm, I guess, or maybe it's written, I don't know.
},
{
    111.2,114.88
     It's kind of the standard that most docs go by is about that six week mark.
},
{
    114.88,118.04
     However, some circumstances may be eight to ten weeks.
},
{
    118.04,122.32
     So make sure you have clearance from your doctor before jumping into any workout routine.
},
{
    122.32,130.32
     And so what I've got Camille doing is she's going to lie on her back with her knees bent. She's going to bring one arm back behind her head, just like that. And then
},
{
    130.32,134.88
     what we want to do, so the muscle that we're after here, it's called the rectus abdominis,
},
{
    134.88,138.96
     okay? It's kind of the six-pack muscle. It's long and it's vertical and it goes down, it goes from
},
{
    138.96,143.92
     your bottom ribs to the top of your pelvis. And so it's this guy right here. And what happens during
},
{
    143.92,149.28
     pregnancy is that's the one that is stretched the most. That's the one that's put under the most stress,
},
{
    149.28,153.76
     and therefore it tends to undergo the most trauma. The muscle itself is made of two
},
{
    153.76,158.4
     muscle bellies that come down and then they're connected by a ligament right down the middle.
},
{
    158.4,162.88
     It goes right from your breastbone, basically down through your belly button, to the top of
},
{
    162.88,168.72
     your pelvis right here. And so it's that ligament that as it gets stretched it can get stretched so far to the point where
},
{
    168.72,172.88
     it actually separates a little bit and that's what we're going to refer to as that diastasis
},
{
    172.88,177.44
     recti or diastasis recti. And so that's what we want to make sure that we don't have that going on
},
{
    177.44,183.12
     before resuming these normal workout activities. And so to check that, so she's laying down and so
},
{
    183.12,186.96
     what I'm going to have her do is put her, so she's got her right hand up behind her head
},
{
    186.96,192.5
     Put her left hand. We're going to take three fingers and she's going to put them vertically just above her belly button
},
{
    193.5,199.04
     Good just like that. Now what I want her to do is just lift her head and shoulders up off of the floor
},
{
    199.04,204.8
     This isn't like a full crunch. We're not getting an ab work on. All I want to do is activate those abdominal muscles
},
{
    204.96,205.12
     Okay, and so she can come in here and then with those three fingers crunch, we're not getting an ab work on, all I want to do is activate those abdominal muscles.
},
{
    205.12,209.68
     Okay, and so she can come in here and then with those three fingers she's filling for two things.
},
{
    209.68,214.8
     So first of all you can kind of feel the valley between those two muscle bellies right there.
},
{
    214.8,219.44
     So you kind of find the middle of it and then what she's going to do is she's going to kind of follow
},
{
    219.44,226.84
     that all the way up. Good. And then she's going to follow that also all the way up. Good. Good. And then she's gonna follow that also all the way down,
},
{
    226.84,228.92
     just right below her belly button as well.
},
{
    228.92,230.72
     And you're filling for a couple of things with this.
},
{
    230.72,233.32
     With your fingers in the vertical, like this,
},
{
    233.32,235.6
     you're checking the integrity of the ligament.
},
{
    235.6,236.48
     And so you're gonna go in there,
},
{
    236.48,238.28
     you should feel like there's a block in there.
},
{
    238.28,240.76
     You should feel like that ligament is intact
},
{
    240.76,243.08
     as you go up and down, okay?
},
{
    243.08,244.28
     And hers feels really good.
},
{
    244.28,247.36
     Hers feels, I'm not worried about any separations in there.
},
{
    247.36,250.52
     If there were a separation, it would be a little, I want to say squishier, don't take
},
{
    250.52,251.52
     that offensive.
},
{
    251.52,254.48
     But you're going to be able to kind of go down there a little bit deeper.
},
{
    254.48,256.12
     There's going to be less resistance to it.
},
{
    256.12,260.32
     So you're going to check the integrity of the ligament up and down.
},
{
    260.32,263.68
     The other thing that I'm going to do, so right again, this is the fingers in the vertical
},
{
    263.68,269.12
     position, I want to rotate my fingers into the horizontal. Okay, so find again where that is. And if I
},
{
    269.12,275.52
     rotate here, I can kind of get, you know, maybe two fingers in there. And then as I go up closer
},
{
    275.52,281.36
     towards her sternum up here, it's maybe a one finger separation. Kind of that one to two fingers
},
{
    281.36,286.62
     separation is going to be completely normal with this. and it's something that we're not too worried about
},
{
    286.62,290.06
     If you can turn three fingers horizontal in there
},
{
    290.06,294.16
     You've got a pretty good separation going on and you may need some further help
},
{
    294.16,298.42
     You may need to you may need to do some other exercises, which I also have available
},
{
    298.7,303.78
     I'll actually I'll leave a link to that to that exercise to that to that workout
},
{
    304.46,307.68
     For the diastasis recti in the in the description of the video or I'll leave it link to that exercise, to that workout for the diastasis recti in the description
},
{
    307.68,311.04
     of the video or I'll leave it in a comment below.
},
{
    311.04,314.04
     But there's some things that you can do to kind of close that up first.
},
{
    314.04,318.44
     So again, one to two fingers is totally normal, but if it's three, there's some things that
},
{
    318.44,323.76
     you want to do to kind of conservatively close that up before jumping back into some of these
},
{
    323.76,324.76
     abdominal workouts.
},
{
    324.76,325.36
     So, what do you think? Observatively close that up before jumping back into some of these abdominal workouts.
},
{
    325.36,329.08
     So what do you think?
},
{
    329.08,330.08
     Try it out.
},
{
    330.08,331.08
     It's medium.
},
{
    331.08,332.08
     Medium.
},
{
    332.08,333.84
     We've got a medium verdict on here.
},
{
    333.84,335.4
     No, and it really feels really good.
},
{
    335.4,339.2
     Again, so with my fingers in the vertical, we're testing the integrity of it, so you
},
{
    339.2,341.48
     should be able to feel a little bit of some resistance there.
},
{
    341.48,345.8
     Turn your fingers in the horizontal, you're checking the degree of the separation on there.
},
{
    345.8,347.04
     Hersh feels really good.
},
{
    347.04,348.2
     And so in that case,
},
{
    348.2,350.64
     I would give her some clearance to start working out again.
},
{
    350.64,354.36
     I did show her some abs stuff that I want her to start doing.
},
{
    354.36,356.96
     Again, we're not gonna jump into planks and sit ups
},
{
    356.96,358.56
     and kind of full hardcore.
},
{
    358.56,360.6
     We're gonna kind of ease into it a little bit.
},
{
    360.6,364.64
     What happens if you did go hardcore without regaining it?
},
{
    364.64,366.0
     No, really good question.
},
{
    366.0,370.0
     And so the danger there is that your abs have been under a certain degree of trauma.
},
{
    370.0,374.0
     And so the last thing you want to do is to continue to basically traumatize those.
},
{
    374.0,379.0
     If you throw too much at it too soon, you're at risk of increasing that separation
},
{
    379.0,384.0
     and actually perpetuating that diastasis, that separation of those muscles in there.
},
{
    384.0,387.28
     Something that we don't want to do. You want a nice strong core, you want a nice
},
{
    387.28,391.32
     strong abdominal wall. I mean not only because swimsuit season is coming, but
},
{
    391.32,395.36
     because just the function in general. You know, as a young mom, Camille, all your
},
{
    395.36,398.84
     young mothers out there are doing a lot of lifting and carrying and things like
},
{
    398.84,402.04
     that where you've got to have a nice strong core and able to do those
},
{
    402.04,406.52
     exercises and to do those activities. And so again, I've already showed Camilla a few exercises.
},
{
    406.52,410.12
     We're going to work a few muscles a little bit differently than jumping straight back
},
{
    410.12,414.64
     into sit ups and crunches, but that'll be another video for another day.
},
{
    414.64,417.36
     So anyway, hope you guys found this informative.

    417.36,418.36
