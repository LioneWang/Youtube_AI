     Hello there, I'm Dr. Bridget Keener. I'm an optometrist at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville,

{
    4.56,10.4
     Florida. Today we're going to talk about how to properly instill eyedrops. Putting in eyedrops is
},
{
    10.4,15.52
     an important part of the treatment of many ocular conditions. The most important thing is that you're
},
{
    15.52,21.28
     able to put them in safely and accurately. To begin, always read the instructions from your
},
{
    21.28,25.0
     eye care provider. Some eye drops have special instructions
},
{
    25.0,31.5
     such as shake well before putting the drop in. Also, be sure to always wash your hands
},
{
    31.5,37.8
     before instilling eye drops. In order to prevent contamination of the bottle, go in to remove
},
{
    37.8,47.32
     the cap and place it on a clean towel. Next, be sure that you're seated comfortably and place your chin upward so that the surface
},
{
    47.32,50.74
     of your eye is parallel to the floor.
},
{
    50.74,56.86
     Look up and with two fingers pull down gently on your lower eyelid.
},
{
    56.86,60.86
     Squeeze the bottle and instill one eye drop.
},
{
    60.86,68.08
     Close your eyes and gently wipe away the excess with a clean tissue. Okay great.
},
{
    68.08,72.16
     Now let's say you don't have someone to help you at home. We'll review the same
},
{
    72.16,77.36
     process if you're doing this on your own. Assume the same position placing the
},
{
    77.36,81.76
     bottle in your dominant hand and using your two fingers of the non-dominant
},
{
    81.76,90.52
     hand to pull down your lower eyelid. Tilt your chin up, placing your head parallel to the floor, using your non-dominant hand,
},
{
    90.52,96.78
     pull down gently on your lower eyelid, raise the bottle, and squeeze gently, and stealing
},
{
    96.78,100.72
     one eye drop.
},
{
    100.72,101.72
     Great job!
},
{
    101.72,107.0
     Notice how he made sure to keep it a safe distance from his eye so as not to contaminate the bottle.
},
{
    107.0,112.0
     Some patients report that it's difficult to feel when the eye drop lands in the eye.
},
{
    112.0,115.0
     To make sure you've done so, I recommend refrigerating the drop.
},
{
    115.0,119.0
     It's easier to feel a cold drop landing on the surface of your eye.
},
{
    119.0,125.12
     Before doing so, make sure to check with your eye doctor to be sure it's safe to refrigerate your eye drops.
},
{
    130.16,135.6
     Some patients wear contact lenses as well. If you're a contact lens wear, be sure to remove your contact lens before instilling the eye drop. Prescription eye drops are not intended to be used
},
{
    135.6,141.52
     with contact lenses. Before resuming contact lens wear, double check with your eye doctor to make
},
{
    141.52,148.58
     sure it's okay. After surgery and in other cases, you may have to use multiple eye drops.
},
{
    148.58,154.2
     In order to do so, you want to allow an adequate amount of time for each drop to be absorbed
},
{
    154.2,156.08
     before instilling the next.
},
{
    156.08,160.08
     I recommend waiting about 10 minutes in between drops.
},
{
    160.08,166.2
     Lastly, your eye doctor may recommend something called punctal occlusion.
},
{
    166.2,170.6
     This is a technique that allows the drop to sit on the surface of the eye and prevents
},
{
    170.6,172.6
     systemic absorption.
},
{
    172.6,178.78
     In order to demonstrate punctal occlusion, you'll put the eye drop in as previously demonstrated
},
{
    178.78,187.4
     and you'll gently apply pressure to the nasal puncta, like so. Stay in this position for approximately five minutes
},
{
    187.4,193.36
     to allow the drop to be absorbed. I think that's all of our tips for today. Do you have any

{
    193.36,200.24
     other questions? Okay, thank you so much for your time. If you have any further questions,
