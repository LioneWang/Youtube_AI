     Hello everyone. Now you probably didn't wake up this morning thinking that you
},
{
    4.14,8.3
     would need to know how to use a bullet wound first aid kit. But
},
{
    8.3,12.06
     unfortunately as we have seen with story after story across our country
},
{
    12.06,16.9
     having that knowledge and the tools could be life saving in a crisis. Michael
},
{
    16.9,19.94
     Dow is joining us today with that information. Michael, thank you so much
},
{
    19.94,23.1
     for coming back. Thanks for having me. Now we're talking about these bullet
},
{
    23.1,26.32
     wound first aid kits and why is this so important for us
},
{
    26.32,27.64
     to be talking about this?
},
{
    27.64,31.84
     Well, the National Library of Medicine says that
},
{
    31.84,33.8
     the amount of blood in the body is dependent
},
{
    33.8,34.96
     on someone's size and weight.
},
{
    34.96,37.4
     So a male that weighs in their 150s
},
{
    37.4,40.4
     only has about a gallon and a half of blood.
},
{
    40.4,47.12
     So here's an example of basically the maximum amount of blood that you can lose before you
},
{
    47.12,49.72
     get in serious trouble and you go into shock.
},
{
    49.72,51.8
     Which is not very much.
},
{
    51.8,57.42
     So having one of these and the time that we're saving with one of these is definitely crucial.
},
{
    57.42,60.76
     And I know you're going to show us here in just a few moments kind of how to use one of
},
{
    60.76,65.2
     these first aid kits, but would you still suggest somebody to still learn CPR
},
{
    65.2,71.12
     in first aid? Yes, definitely. Even though every kid comes with its own instruction sheet, everyone
},
{
    71.12,75.92
     should still have Red Cross first aid CPR training. Well, I love that today we're going to actually
},
{
    75.92,79.76
     see what's inside the kit and you're going to kind of walk us through kind of like a mock what you
},
{
    79.76,83.92
     would do with the kid if something happened. And my co-host Alex, of course, is going to come
},
{
    83.92,85.0
     and help us with this. Alex, you're going to basically going to be like something happened. And my co-host Alex, of course, is gonna come and help us with this.
},
{
    85.0,87.84
     Alex, you're gonna basically going to be a victim.
},
{
    87.84,89.08
     That's right.
},
{
    89.08,90.8
     You never know when tragedy is gonna strike,
},
{
    90.8,92.16
     but luckily we have this kit.
},
{
    92.16,93.48
     Okay.
},
{
    93.48,95.88
     So Michael, we're gonna basically simulate
},
{
    95.88,97.56
     that if he had an injury on his leg, correct?
},
{
    97.56,98.92
     Yes, on his lower leg.
},
{
    98.92,103.84
     So first, we're gonna get out the gloves
},
{
    103.84,107.24
     because you might be doing this on a stranger.
},
{
    107.24,108.56
     And you don't know.
},
{
    108.56,111.12
     And it's special about these gloves that you're taking out?
},
{
    111.12,114.92
     Well they're sterile and they're nitrile gloves.
},
{
    114.92,120.48
     And the reason why they're nitrile gloves is because of some people do have the latex
},
{
    120.48,122.12
     allergies.
},
{
    122.12,126.8
     So you know, we're just trying to prevent any other medical complications
},
{
    126.8,130.96
     from this kit. So, that's the purpose of the nitrile gloves.
},
{
    130.96,134.68
     Alright, so we put our gloves on first, like you said, that we may be dealing with the
},
{
    134.68,139.08
     blood of someone we're not familiar with. So we want to keep ourselves safe as well.
},
{
    139.08,147.84
     Okay. So, Alex, here I'm about to cut your pants to get to the wound. Here I see it on your leg here.
},
{
    147.84,150.0
     And these scissors are in the kit,
},
{
    150.0,151.7
     so we see that it can get through jeans
},
{
    151.7,154.76
     or any other material we may have to get through in order
},
{
    154.76,155.76
     to get to the wound.
},
{
    155.76,159.2
     Yes, and they are EMS shears so that you don't have to worry
},
{
    159.2,162.36
     about jabbing the person's leg.
},
{
    162.36,166.08
     So here we're going to take out the clotting sponge.
},
{
    166.08,168.88
     And Alex, if you can stand up and sit up
},
{
    168.88,171.28
     and put this on the wound right there.
},
{
    171.28,172.12
     Hold it in place.
},
{
    172.12,174.08
     And how does the clotting sponge work, Michael?
},
{
    174.08,179.08
     It starts a cascade of changes in proteins in the blood
},
{
    179.86,184.86
     that ends up causing, or protein called fibrin,
},
{
    190.0,192.76
     to lay down in strips. And here we go.
},
{
    192.76,197.36
     When the idea here too is that if someone is not fatally wounded yet, they can assist
},
{
    197.36,198.36
     you by holding this.
},
{
    198.36,200.28
     Yes, yes.
},
{
    200.28,205.7
     And I do notice, Michael, that we have two clotting sponges and two dressings in the kit.
},
{
    205.7,208.1
     Why is that for multiple injuries?
},
{
    208.1,213.18
     Well, with bullet wounds, what some people don't think about
},
{
    213.18,216.54
     is that there's going to be an entrance and an exit wound.
},
{
    216.54,219.68
     Oh, okay. So that's why we have two of each.
},
{
    219.68,222.92
     Yes. And so here, I'm gonna tie the knot
},
{
    222.92,227.32
     on top of the wound to keep that pressure there.
},
{
    227.32,232.06
     So now we're going to take out the second clotting sponge and we're going to simulate
},
{
    232.06,234.08
     that the exit wound was right there.
},
{
    234.08,240.32
     If Alex, if you can hold that in place, I'll get that next one out.
},
{
    240.32,248.48
     And now while we're doing both the entry and the exit wound, I know, Michael, if the clotting and the dressing,
},
{
    248.48,251.2
     we need something beyond that, still inside the kit,
},
{
    251.2,252.48
     we have a tourniquet, correct?
},
{
    252.48,253.44
     Yes.
},
{
    253.44,257.12
     Now, I know you specifically chose a specific kind of tourniquet
},
{
    257.12,257.52
     for this.
},
{
    257.52,258.32
     Why was that?
},
{
    259.52,263.6
     You'll see in just a little bit, it's got a very long cord
},
{
    264.0,265.74
     and just a little bit, it's got a very long cord
},
{
    270.74,275.18
     and it's for, frankly, obese individuals
},
{
    279.34,281.5
     that have very large thighs. You're gonna wanna have a tourniquet
},
{
    281.5,283.42
     that will go around the whole thigh.
},
{
    283.42,287.24
     Okay, so now we've got the kit.
},
{
    288.32,289.76
     They're on the wound.
},
{
    289.76,291.56
     No stabs hurt inside the kit,
},
{
    291.56,293.28
     but this is elevating the leg.
},
{
    293.28,296.24
     Okay, so right across CPR first aid training,
},
{
    296.24,299.08
     it says that for a limb, you're gonna elevate it
},
{
    299.08,302.2
     above the level of the heart to help gravity
},
{
    302.2,303.8
     lessen the amount of blood loss.
},
{
    303.8,308.12
     You're gonna put pressure on the wound, which we've already done by tying the nut
},
{
    308.12,311.04
     on top of the clotting sponge.
},
{
    311.04,316.14
     And now we're elevating the wound with whatever we can find in the environment.
},
{
    316.14,321.6
     And if you still see that there's a lot of blood coming out, you're going to do a pressure
},
{
    321.6,322.6
     point.
},
{
    322.6,328.52
     And there is a picture on my instruction sheet about the different pressure points and here
},
{
    328.52,332.52
     it's going to be right underneath the knee. So. And Michael while we're also
},
{
    332.52,335.88
     doing this before we run out of time if somebody has one of these I know we have
},
{
    335.88,339.08
     multiple different kits that we can purchase but where's a good place to
},
{
    339.08,343.88
     keep one once we have it at home? Frankly you can keep it anywhere in your
},
{
    343.88,347.04
     backpack if you're a student at school,
},
{
    347.04,351.68
     at work, in your desk, in the car.
},
{
    351.68,354.64
     OK, so now we're going to simulate
},
{
    354.64,358.08
     that the blood loss is not stopping.
},
{
    358.08,363.12
     So we're going to put this string in the hole there.
},
{
    363.12,365.0
     We're not going to really tie it as tight as we would
},
{
    365.0,367.0
     to not hurt you like here.
},
{
    367.0,370.0
     But you're going to tie it as tight as you can.
},
{
    370.0,373.0
     Well Michael, I know all of this information is inside the kit.
},
{
    373.0,376.0
     Like we said, we do still recommend that people, you know,
},
{
    376.0,378.0
     get first aid training and everything that comes along with this.
},
{
    378.0,382.0
     But we can see how easy it was to use this and kind of follow those steps.
},
{
    382.0,384.0
     And I want to thank you so much for coming and showing us.
},
{
    384.0,388.4
     And thank you, Alex, for being our helper and victim for today.
},
{
    388.4,389.84
     All right, you guys at home right now,
},
{
    389.84,392.96
     you can actually get 13% off all items.
