     Hi, I'm Dr. Paul Spanky from Foot and Ankle Associates of North Texas in Great Vine and

     Today we'll be discussing the proper ways you can ice an extremity after a surgery and
},
{
    20.32,21.32
     injury.
},
{
    21.32,23.4
     There are different types of things you can ice with.
},
{
    23.4,24.92
     My favorite is these little gel pads.
},
{
    24.92,28.08
     The reason why I like these is because you can throw them in the freezer, they freeze up
},
{
    28.08,32.16
     pretty quickly and they only last for like 30 minutes. You never really want to ice for more
},
{
    32.16,36.8
     than 30 minutes because you can actually cause frostbite. Some of their options are taking ice
},
{
    36.8,41.12
     from the fridge, putting that in a bag, or taking frozen peas which is a real popular one. You just
},
{
    41.12,47.92
     don't want to serve those to your friends or guests once you're done with them. But when you ever use something like this, it's always very important that you never
},
{
    47.92,51.12
     put a gel pack or ice directly on the skin.
},
{
    51.12,53.72
     And the ways you can prevent that are pretty simple.
},
{
    53.72,56.8
     In the case of most foot surgeries, we're putting the ice pack directly on the side
},
{
    56.8,59.64
     of the injury or behind the knee or around the ankle.
},
{
    59.64,63.48
     And when you do that, especially with a pack like this, you're going to wrap it in something,
},
{
    63.48,64.48
     be that a towel.
},
{
    64.48,65.08
     I find that a real easy way to do that is especially with a pack like this, you'd want to wrap it in something, be that a towel.
},
{
    65.08,66.96
     I find that a real easy way to do that is
},
{
    66.96,71.52
     everybody has these grocery bags that local vendors give you
},
{
    71.52,74.96
     or like you pick up that fare or something like that.
},
{
    74.96,76.36
     But these have just the thin enough material
},
{
    76.36,77.2
     that you put in a nice pack
},
{
    77.2,78.76
     and then after it's been cooled down,
},
{
    78.76,79.6
     you put it against the skin,
},
{
    79.6,81.6
     you're not going to give yourself frostbite.
},
{
    81.6,82.88
     But whenever you apply the ice towel
},
{
    82.88,85.0
     is just for about 30 minutes.
},
{
    85.0,89.0
     The most you would really apply that is 30 minutes every hour, especially after a surgery.
},
{
    89.0,92.8
     That's a good way to prevent it from swelling, which will cause a lot of the pain. But you
},
{
    92.8,97.3
     would never do this no fewer than three times a day after a surgery. Now, when we do a surgery,
},
{
    97.3,100.8
     obviously I have my shoe on here, but we'll have a dressing on the foot. That dressing
},
{
    100.8,104.12
     typically is pretty large. So when you put a nice pack on it, you may not feel that cold
},
{
    104.12,105.18
     come through. You can always attempt that. If that works great, so when you put an ice pack on it, you may not feel that cold come through.
},
{
    105.18,108.62
     You can always attempt that, if that works great, but if you don't feel the cold coming
},
{
    108.62,112.46
     through, we kind of go to our next options, which the first one is on the inside of the
},
{
    112.46,113.78
     ankle here.
},
{
    113.78,116.78
     The arteries and the veins come through this area, so if you put an ice pack there for
},
{
    116.78,121.3
     30 minutes, that will reduce the swelling and the post-operative pain.
},
{
    121.3,124.62
     Often we have a cast on or even higher dressing, and you're not going to get that cold come
},
{
    124.62,125.0
     through.
},
{
    125.0,130.0
     So you put that ice pack right behind the knee where most of the vessels are and that will reduce the swelling.
},
{
    130.0,133.0
     One of the most important things to do when you ice is you never ice the extremity.
},
{
    133.0,137.0
     With the extremity dangling down towards the floor, you'd always want to elevate that.
},
{
    137.0,141.0
     In the chair I'm in now I can't elevate my leg high enough but you want that leg higher than your waist
},
{
    141.0,148.76
     so that the gravity is actually draining the blood back to your core and not down your foot as you ice your foot. You know if you
},
{
    148.76,151.04
     were having irritation with the skin obviously you should call your physician.
},
{
    151.04,154.92
     Usually that's going to be from leaving the ice on too long but again these ice
},
{
    154.92,158.76
     packs are great because when you use these they just they cool down and
},
{
    158.76,162.08
     actually become warm where you're not going to burn the skin and that is the
},
{
    162.08,166.24
     proper way to ice a leg after a surgery.
},
