     and I'll get back to you.
},
{
    67.44,72.44
     I'm going to start this routine guys
},
{
    74.08,76.88
     with using a foam roller for our thighs,
},
{
    76.88,78.52
     which means our quaterceps,
},
{
    78.52,81.52
     the muscle that it actually stay in front of your thighs.
},
{
    81.52,83.12
     I'm gonna show you how to try it
},
{
    83.12,84.6
     and you can give it a try.
},
{
    84.6,86.6
     What we're trying to achieve all of this routine
},
{
    86.6,89.56
     is to let these muscles actually relax.
},
{
    89.56,92.0
     And while you're using the form model,
},
{
    92.0,95.04
     if your body is not in a relaxed state,
},
{
    95.04,96.4
     it's actually not gonna help you
},
{
    96.4,98.64
     to get any advantage of using it.
},
{
    98.64,101.68
     Now, which means while we're trying to do these movements,
},
{
    101.68,103.88
     we're trying to stay as relaxed as possible.
},
{
    103.88,107.6
     And that's why we try to do it in a single leg mode,
},
{
    107.6,109.98
     and that gives you a chance to actually adjust the weight
},
{
    109.98,112.64
     that you're putting on the foam roller.
},
{
    112.64,114.88
     What we're trying to do, we're trying to,
},
{
    114.88,117.04
     let's say try on the right leg.
},
{
    117.04,119.4
     My opposite leg is on the kneeling position,
},
{
    119.4,122.96
     and I'm not leaning all of my body weight on this side.
},
{
    122.96,127.96
     I'm trying to balance them between my left and my right knee.
},
{
    128.28,132.0
     And what you can see, I'm not going very quick.
},
{
    132.0,134.76
     I'm trying to relax my right foot
},
{
    134.76,137.48
     and my toes is on the ground.
},
{
    137.48,141.5
     It's not up here because that lead more weight on my thighs.
},
{
    141.5,143.16
     Which means I relax my toes there
},
{
    143.16,145.52
     and I try to slide them on the
},
{
    145.52,146.52
     ground.
},
{
    146.52,154.0
     As you can see, I look at the area that is feel tight and I work around that.
},
{
    154.0,160.16
     Very slow and gentle, I try to breathe in and out, not forcing it.
},
{
    160.16,167.28
     I'm trying to consciously relax my thighs as well. Now, do I set an area that as you go
},
{
    168.0,175.04
     down towards your basic IT band, it's very very sore and I would suggest you stay away from those
},
{
    175.04,182.24
     area, which means work around where you feel it's actually manageable. If you've never done this before,
},
{
    182.24,187.64
     try it suddenly from never doing it to something like very
},
{
    187.64,190.44
     high intensity, it can be very uncomfortable.
},
{
    190.44,193.16
     Now you can try the same thing from the other side.
},
{
    193.16,197.52
     I'm going to show you the left side then you can see actually my right knee.
},
{
    197.52,208.16
     I bring my knees up, which kind of like give me a bit of support. And as you can see, I'm not putting all of my body weight
},
{
    208.16,212.9
     there, breathing it out.
},
{
    214.0,219.0
     And you can work all the way up to the top of your hip bone,
},
{
    222.32,227.16
     basically around your pelvis. That area is actually
},
{
    227.16,237.88
     very pleasant when you try the foam roll otherwise in comparison to the lower part
},
{
    237.88,242.88
     of the thighs is actually very more pleasant. You can work around it and
},
{
    242.88,246.86
     give it a try. Now how long do you need to spend time there?
},
{
    246.86,250.08
     It all depends how much time you have. You can spend between
},
{
    250.64,252.72
     five, eight minutes
},
{
    252.72,256.36
     for both sides. Give it a try and let me know how you're getting on.
},
{
    256.62,261.86
     The next area that I'm going to show you that you can use the foam roller is going to be the basically glued muscle.
},
{
    261.98,263.98
     It's a very simple and
},
{
    264.48,266.76
     kind of nice way to use the foam
},
{
    266.76,272.88
     roller. What we're trying to do, we're trying to try each, let's say, and bot chicks, and
},
{
    272.88,279.24
     like basically in time. Let's say I'm trying to work on my right hip. I'm basically trying
},
{
    279.24,288.08
     to kind of like lean on my hand and literally put all of my body weight on the right side which
},
{
    288.08,294.16
     means my hip is actually off the foam roller from the left side. Now initially
},
{
    294.16,298.08
     you want to try from this state which means you are kind of like just
},
{
    298.08,302.2
     basically leaning on it, you're playing around with it and you will definitely
},
{
    302.2,307.96
     find the glute muscles can be very tight But in a good way, which means it's not similar to thigh muscle
},
{
    308.16,311.88
     Tie muscle can be very painful, but glute is actually pleasant
},
{
    312.0,318.2
     Which means you can work around it and as you can see I don't stay in one place. I work around it and
},
{
    320.04,325.96
     Kind of like roll it if I feel one place is is is is more tighter. I stay there
},
{
    327.0,328.2
     but
},
{
    328.2,332.56
     Make sure to stay relaxed now if you want to progress that what can you do is to?
},
{
    332.96,336.56
     Bring your opposite legs on top of Disney which means like
},
{
    337.08,341.48
     Your the foot that actually you are stretching you bring it up and
},
{
    342.32,344.4
     it kind of like stretch the hip and
},
{
    347.48,353.76
     glute muscle. It kind of like give more tension on the muscle and you can feel like there's other area in
},
{
    353.76,355.72
     the glutes that actually get stretched.
},
{
    355.72,362.0
     But if you've never done this kind of like mobility routine before or used formula before,
},
{
    362.0,364.24
     don't jump into this straight away.
},
{
    364.24,368.96
     I'm going to show you from a different angle that you can see here.
},
{
    368.96,371.8
     I'm going to use the, let's say, left side.
},
{
    371.8,376.44
     And initially, I wanted to just lean in one side.
},
{
    376.44,380.48
     This hip is not fully basically bend it.
},
{
    380.48,382.4
     I relax the hip there.
},
{
    382.4,386.92
     I feel more tension in this side. I just work around the area
},
{
    386.92,394.76
     that it feels tight. Breathing in and out. Try to stay relaxed. If I want to progress
},
{
    394.76,402.24
     it from here, I bring this foot up. I'm still staying on the same hand. You need to just
},
{
    402.24,406.32
     get the right technique when you're doing this.
},
{
    406.32,413.88
     In this way, you're kind of like using your body weight to, with that pressure, give you
},
{
    413.88,415.68
     more kind of like relief.
},
{
    415.68,426.54
     Now, as you can see, similar to the first exercise, I don't spend too much time between let's say five to eight minutes maximum for
},
{
    426.54,428.02
     both sides.
},
{
    428.02,430.5
     Give it a go and make sure to relax.
},
{
    430.5,435.34
     If it didn't feel comfortable, don't push it to cross your leg and slowly progress it.
},
{
    435.34,442.42
     All right, guys, I'm going to move on to a lower and basically back movement and area.
},
{
    442.42,446.48
     This actually can be a musable for your lower back or your lumbar
},
{
    446.48,452.82
     area. In some cases I use it for trastic as well but in many cases people are not feeling
},
{
    452.82,456.12
     very comfortable. I'm going to show you how to do it and you can give it a try. As you
},
{
    456.12,462.88
     can see I'm using my elbow as a leverage to help me to balance my weight on the foam roller
},
{
    462.88,469.88
     which means you don't want to put all of your weight there, which means if you stand there, it's not very comfortable. It actually still
},
{
    469.88,477.16
     kind of like stretch your hip and your glutes, but if you are going down on the elbow, you
},
{
    477.16,482.44
     can balance. And again, one side can be a little bit more tender than from the other
},
{
    482.44,487.58
     side. I even stay there, just breathing in and out.
},
{
    487.58,488.58
     Don't even move.
},
{
    488.58,494.24
     Sometimes staying in a place, let your body to relax can be really helpful.
},
{
    494.24,501.86
     If you find it comfortable, you can slightly lean to one side and draw your body weight
},
{
    501.86,503.16
     in one side.
},
{
    503.16,505.58
     This can be a later stage. Don't rush it to
},
{
    505.58,511.14
     here. Slowly build up movement. Breathe in and out. This is actually pleasant. It's
},
{
    511.14,515.66
     not very sore but I can feel those muscles are actually getting some sore
},
{
    515.66,522.14
     of like stretching relief. I lean to the other side. My right side is not as
},
{
    522.14,527.4
     tight as the left side. You might find the same thing that one side can be more tender.
},
{
    527.4,529.76
     Now how far I go up?
},
{
    529.76,533.04
     To be honest, I just stay around here.
},
{
    533.04,536.8
     I just stay around here and breathe in and out.
},
{
    536.8,539.6
     I try my body to relax.
},
{
    539.6,541.4
     Can I go higher?
},
{
    541.4,542.4
     Obviously I can.
},
{
    542.4,546.48
     I'm going to show you how you're going to progress this to a bit of
},
{
    546.48,552.32
     kind of like a drastic mobility because in your trussick you kind of like getting more rotation
},
{
    552.32,558.08
     but in non-bar we get more flexion and extension. Now for trussick this is not necessary for your
},
{
    558.08,570.4
     upper back and it's more is a chest opener that actually help your upper body kind of like does the opposite that we do usually because we usually see it and we use things here.
},
{
    570.52,571.88
     We want to just open up this.
},
{
    571.88,574.96
     I'm going to show you how to do it and you can progress to reduce routine.
},
{
    575.28,576.2
     What do you want to do?
},
{
    576.2,586.48
     You want to find a position that you feel comfortable to actually lean back because even staying here sometimes, if you've never done done this before can be very sensitive and sore.
},
{
    586.48,592.8
     You want to stay here and slowly shift your body back which means breathing it out
},
{
    595.84,602.88
     and lean back on it. What I would suggest to don't rush it to lean too far back start
},
{
    606.96,613.36
     don't rush it to lean too far back. Start with the kind of like bring the foam roller a little bit higher towards your neck and you're kind of just leaning there and you want to lean back
},
{
    614.96,617.36
     and move forward. Breathing in and out.
},
{
    620.88,632.52
     As you can see I hold my hands on my chest. I don't want to open up now yet.
},
{
    632.52,638.48
     With breathing, I kind of open up my whole lower back and upper back.
},
{
    638.48,646.48
     Now I kind of like bring this form over, even a little bit hard to get my, kind of like it's below my shoulder
},
{
    646.48,652.96
     blades. You can start basically from there and go all the way down there.
},
{
    656.08,663.6
     I relax my neck. What can you do? You want to slowly lean back. This can be a good
},
{
    663.6,666.18
     initial state for you and if you felt
},
{
    666.18,670.38
     it's too much you can actually roll it down and it comes more towards your
},
{
    670.38,691.24
     neck and that can be your initial phase to solve it. Come back, breathe in. If I feel comfortable, I open up my hands.
},
{
    691.24,692.24
     Just watch your neck, guys.
},
{
    692.24,694.4
     You don't want to hold your neck too tight.
},
{
    694.4,700.96
     You want to relax your neck.
},
{
    700.96,710.2
     I even go lower. When I felt comfortable here I can progress it and come back up
},
{
    710.2,715.76
     which means the formula comes closer to my lower back and then I can open up my
},
{
    715.76,719.44
     chest and my arms.
},
{
    722.6,731.36
     What you want it to try, you want to breathe in and breathe out.
},
{
    731.36,739.72
     If you want to even progress it more, lean level back.
},
{
    739.72,745.4
     Now there are a couple of things that I really want you to try to follow while you're doing
},
{
    745.4,746.72
     this routine guys.
},
{
    746.72,750.64
     The first thing is that make sure to work around your own range.
},
{
    750.64,756.36
     Don't challenge yourself too quickly and don't force your body to actually move towards
},
{
    756.36,758.4
     something that you haven't done it.
},
{
    758.4,762.68
     And one of the most important things that I would suggest you to don't do with foam
},
{
    762.68,765.0
     roller, do not stretch
},
{
    765.0,770.2
     your IT band or use it for your IT band. I've seen a lot of people doing this and it's a
},
{
    770.2,774.96
     very sore structure and one of the things that study and research shows and lately that
},
{
    774.96,779.68
     IT band is not supposed to be extra flexible. It's a structure that gives you knee stability
},
{
    779.68,784.36
     and we don't want to stretch it. Stop doing your IT band because it's going to be very
},
{
    784.36,785.68
     painful and useless
},
{
    785.68,790.32
     basically, you're wasting your time. Now the last thing that I would like to add as a tip today,
},
{
    790.32,796.08
     if you're suffering from sciatica or periformis syndrome, which is a pain down to your glutes,
},
{
    796.08,801.36
     I would probably suggest you to don't do this in your acute phase, which means if you're in
},
{
    801.36,810.84
     acute phase and you feel that sitting is not even comfortable, do not apply foam roller on that area or on your glutes. If you have any question guys,
},
{
    810.84,815.24
     leave me a comment and I would be happy to get back to you. I hope you guys find this video
},
{
    815.24,819.88
     helpful. If you have any question, leave me a comment below and I'll get back to you quickly.
},
{
    819.88,827.96
     Don't forget to subscribe our channel and make sure to watch our series of mobility for back pain and disc bulges in this channel.
},
{
    827.96,832.24
     I'll leave you a video up here that I would definitely suggest you to try it in a daily
},
{
    832.24,836.34
     basis and it will definitely help you with pain and mobility.
},
{
    836.34,858.78
     Until next week, all the best. Thank you.
