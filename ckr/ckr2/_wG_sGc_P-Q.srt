     Today we're going to be looking at a simple three-part mobility drill to help reduce or combat the neck tension that builds up for most of us throughout the day.
},
{
    21.0,25.96
     If you're like most people, you sit all day in front of the computer or whatever and we
},
{
    25.96,30.4
     develop over the course of a long work day what we call caveman posture.
},
{
    30.4,37.08
     One of the primary components of caveman posture is this motion where our skull basically
},
{
    37.08,38.8
     starts to wrap toward the back.
},
{
    38.8,42.64
     A lot of people wind up developing a lot of tension through the base of the skull throughout
},
{
    42.64,43.64
     the day.
},
{
    43.64,46.76
     I want to show you a simple three-part movement that you can do throughout the day
},
{
    46.76,48.76
     that will really help reduce that tension.
},
{
    48.76,53.16
     And if you have headaches or jaw issues or neck issues that come about from that tension,
},
{
    53.16,55.16
     this should help you combat those as well.
},
{
    55.16,57.88
     So simple three-part movement, here we go.
},
{
    57.88,59.96
     What we're going to imagine is that we have a board under our chin.
},
{
    59.96,62.0
     So I'm going to have you start in nice tall posture.
},
{
    62.0,68.06
     And then what I want you to do is I want you to tuck your chin so in essence you're going to be basically pulling or pushing the board
},
{
    68.06,72.64
     down and also pulling it back towards you just a little bit with your jaw.
},
{
    72.64,75.52
     Once you've done that, you're going to hold that position, then you're going to tilt your
},
{
    75.52,79.52
     head back just a little bit, your whole neck, and then imagine there's a string attaching
},
{
    79.52,86.52
     your sternum up to the ceiling and simply slide your chest, your upper chest along that string.
},
{
    86.52,90.12
     Now if you do this correctly you're going to feel quite a bit of tension
},
{
    90.12,93.2
     building up in the base of your skull. You may have to play around with the
},
{
    93.2,96.56
     positioning a little bit, but if you're doing it correctly as I said should
},
{
    96.56,100.16
     feel like a nice stretch right through here and I want you to keep this
},
{
    100.16,103.96
     relatively low key. We're not trying to make it feel like a hard hamstring
},
{
    103.96,108.44
     scratch or something like that. Keep it about a 3 out of 10 intensity level and simply move in
},
{
    108.44,112.44
     and out of it. If this feels good to you, I'm going to have you do it 3 to 5 times.
},
{
    112.44,115.52
     But I'm going to show it from the side because there are a couple of little issues that often
},
{
    115.52,120.64
     come up. So number one, again we're standing in a nice tall posture. We've got our board.
},
{
    120.64,125.4
     We need to push the board down but also pull it back toward our throat. That's
},
{
    125.4,129.44
     very important because that's going to set the suboxyphal muscles under a little
},
{
    129.44,133.14
     bit of stress to begin with. So we're going to hold that chin position where
},
{
    133.14,139.04
     they're going to tilt the head back a little bit and then imagine the chest is
},
{
    139.04,143.28
     moving up on that string as we're holding the chin tuck. Again if you do that
},
{
    143.28,148.36
     correctly you're going to feel a nice stretch through here. The biggest problem that most people have with this exercise
},
{
    148.36,152.48
     is they tuck their chin, but then as they slide up the rope, they let the chin come
},
{
    152.48,157.2
     untucked. That's going to reduce the effectiveness of the exercise. The second big issue that
},
{
    157.2,161.44
     we see is that people will hold this position well, but then they just bend from their lower
},
{
    161.44,168.96
     back. That's not going to work. You have to imagine, again, that the upper chest is sliding forward and up while you're holding that chin tuck.
},
{
    168.96,173.92
     That's going to make it maximally effective. Now, if that feels good to you, again, you do three to
},
{
    173.92,178.56
     five repetitions, we're going to intensify it a little bit and target either the left side or the
},
{
    178.56,183.52
     right side by adding a tilt to the motion. So I'm going to focus on my left side right now.
},
{
    184.24,189.04
     The way that I'm going to do this is exactly the same. I'm going to push the board down, pull it back toward my
},
{
    189.04,194.32
     throat. Now I'm going to take my right ear, bend it toward my right shoulder just a little bit.
},
{
    194.32,199.84
     So I have this flex position and I tilt it to the side. Now I do the same thing. A little bit of
},
{
    199.84,205.52
     tilt at the neck, slide up the rope, and that gives me a really strong pulling sensation
},
{
    205.52,207.52
     right toward the outside,
},
{
    207.52,209.56
     what's called the lateral surface of my skull.
},
{
    209.56,211.3
     Feels really, really good.
},
{
    211.3,212.76
     Now as you do this, I want you to do
},
{
    212.76,215.6
     three to five repetitions in the neutral position,
},
{
    215.6,217.76
     three to five with your head tilted to the right,
},
{
    217.76,219.98
     three to five with your head tilted to the left.
},
{
    219.98,221.86
     You probably will find that one side
},
{
    221.86,224.44
     is a lot tighter than the other, completely normal.
},
{
    224.44,227.92
     You just may want to focus on that side a little bit more throughout the day.
},
{
    227.92,230.36
     Really important to keep the intensity low.
},
{
    230.36,233.36
     If you let the intensity go up, you may give yourself a headache and you don't want that
},
{
    233.36,234.36
     to happen.
},
{
    234.36,237.88
     So again, keep this like a three out of ten intensity level, just a few repetitions, but
},
{
    237.88,241.52
     if you do this every hour or two throughout the day, it's going to make your neck feel
},
{
    241.52,242.52
     fantastic.
},
{
    242.52,245.44
     Because this is going to be a little bit of a weird exercise, I'm actually going to do
},
{
    245.44,246.96
     your free reps with you, okay?
},
{
    246.96,248.36
     So let's do this together.
},
{
    248.36,249.36
     Nice and tall.
},
{
    249.36,251.68
     Once again, we're going to push the board down, pull it back toward the throat a little
},
{
    251.68,257.64
     bit, tilt the head back some, and then drive the chest up while tilting the chin a little
},
{
    257.64,258.64
     bit more.
},
{
    258.64,259.64
     That's rep one.
},
{
    259.64,260.64
     Do it again.
},
{
    260.64,266.14
     Push the board down, pull it back, pull the neck back, chest up.
},
{
    266.14,268.22
     That's two, she'll be getting a little bit looser.
},
{
    268.22,275.58
     Number three, board down, pull it back, head back, chest up.
},
{
    275.58,276.58
     That's rep.
},
{
    276.58,278.38
     Number three, doesn't take very long.
},
{
    278.38,282.86
     Now that we've gone through this basic mobility drill for your upper neck and skull, there
},
{
    282.86,284.94
     are a couple things I want to remind you of.
},
{
    284.94,286.84
     In the Z-Ealt system, we're all about assessing and reassessing.
},
{
    286.84,288.44
     So if you get a lot of neck tension,
},
{
    288.44,289.6
     you start doing this exercise,
},
{
    289.6,291.52
     and it makes you feel great, awesome.
},
{
    291.52,293.0
     If you do this exercise,
},
{
    293.0,294.48
     and it doesn't really change anything,
},
{
    294.48,296.6
     it doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad exercise for you,
},
{
    296.6,299.44
     but it may mean that you have some other issues going on.
},
{
    299.44,301.16
     Lots of people that develop this upper neck
},
{
    301.16,302.44
     or neck tension throughout the day
},
{
    302.44,304.44
     also have vision problems.
},
{
    304.44,309.14
     They may have inner ear issues, and we have a lot of information, a lot of blogs and products
},
{
    309.14,310.14
     around that.
},
{
    310.14,314.62
     So please, if you do this exercise and it seems to help some, but your tension continues
},
{
    314.62,317.94
     to build up, you know, over the next few weeks, please keep watching.
},
{
    317.94,322.26
     Go to our blog list, check out some of the information we have on the eyes and inner
},
{
    322.26,329.36
     ear particularly because that can be really, really important in eliminating the actual cause of the neck tension as it builds up.
},
{
    329.36,332.0
     So guys, if you have any questions about this, please let me know.
},
{
    332.0,333.0
     Otherwise, good luck.
},
{
    333.0,334.0
     I hope it helps you tremendously.
},
{
    334.0,347.0
     Throw it again.
},
{
    347.0,353.0
     If that's the one.
},
{
    353.0,357.0
     We got the throw.
},
