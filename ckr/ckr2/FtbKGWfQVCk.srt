     Hi, I'm Michelle. Today I'm going to teach you four great little stretches to help you
},
{
    18.12,23.2
     relieve muscle tightness that contributes to plant a fasciitis. These exercises involve
},
{
    23.2,26.88
     you wearing shoes. You're going to need to have a firm last in the shoe,
},
{
    26.88,30.28
     or like a jogger, and being near a wall.
},
{
    30.28,32.92
     So our first stretch involves you getting your heel
},
{
    32.92,35.46
     really close to the wall and your toe upright
},
{
    35.46,36.92
     against the wall.
},
{
    36.92,39.08
     So get your heel in as close as you can
},
{
    39.08,40.88
     so that you're stretching the muscles down
},
{
    40.88,43.64
     through the calf and into the arch of your foot.
},
{
    43.64,45.16
     That includes the plant
},
{
    45.16,49.72
     a fascia. So bringing your body now up, bring your hips close and if you can,
},
{
    49.72,53.72
     bring your pelvis forward or your hips close to the wall and come up on the
},
{
    53.72,57.36
     back toe to increase that stretch. Some of you will need to start with the foot
},
{
    57.36,63.04
     down flat but to increase the stretch come in close and hold it. Now push down
},
{
    63.04,65.32
     through your heel and make sure that your
},
{
    65.32,70.6
     knee is straight to get that deep stretch into your calf and you might even feel it
},
{
    70.6,76.52
     into the arch of your foot. Hold it there, try to relax your breathing and ideally
},
{
    76.52,81.12
     you're holding that stretch for 30 seconds at a time and let's take it back
},
{
    81.12,85.68
     down. Now the second stretch is a variation on that stretch. We're going to
},
{
    85.68,92.16
     bring the heel in close to the wall but turn the toe outwards. All right so the toes turned out.
},
{
    92.16,96.88
     Now keeping the legs straight, turn your body around. I'm going to come up on the back toe
},
{
    96.88,102.56
     to increase the stretch. Turn your body right around to the other side. Now this is how you
},
{
    102.56,105.36
     stretch the outside part of that calf.
},
{
    105.36,109.0
     So we're being really specific where we're stretching in the calf. Outside
},
{
    109.0,113.48
     part of the calf and the arch, turn your body away, push down through your heel
},
{
    113.48,117.8
     and hold that stretch. Now I can feel a strong stretch through the outside part
},
{
    117.8,123.2
     of my calf muscle going right down into the heel and releasing slowly.
},
{
    123.2,125.52
     Remembering these stretches shouldn't cause you any
},
{
    125.52,129.44
     discomfort, just a feeling of stretching is enough if you're feeling that the
},
{
    129.44,136.52
     stretches are too intense. Back them off a little bit. Other side, this time turn
},
{
    136.52,140.34
     the toe inwards. So we're stretching the inside part of the calf so the toe turns
},
{
    140.34,144.76
     inwards. Again this time bringing your hips forward towards the wall, keep your
},
{
    144.76,145.0
     knees straight and turn your body around. I'm turning around to face you now turns inwards. Again, this time bringing your hips forward towards the wall, keep your knees
},
{
    145.0,150.26
     straight and turn your body around. I'm turning around to face you now with my toe turned
},
{
    150.26,156.34
     inwards. Again, keeping the legs straight, pushing down through the heel, maintaining
},
{
    156.34,164.54
     that stretch, relax your breathing, keep holding the stretch, keep holding, relaxing the breathing
},
{
    164.54,166.88
     and coming down out of the stretch.
},
{
    166.88,170.16
     So depending on where, which part of the calf is the tightest,
},
{
    170.16,171.28
     you'll feel the most stretch.
},
{
    171.28,173.52
     It might be the outside part of the calf
},
{
    173.52,175.24
     or the inside part.
},
{
    175.24,177.48
     The final stretch is more for the Achilles tendon
},
{
    177.48,179.36
     and down deep into the calf,
},
{
    179.36,182.12
     right, getting right down in close to the heel.
},
{
    182.12,191.36
     Again, take your heel in as close to the wall as you can. Bring your body up and now bend that knee into towards the wall
},
{
    191.36,196.24
     and I can feel a really strong stretch down into my Achilles tendon and that's
},
{
    196.24,200.44
     continuous through that plantar fascia that runs up underneath the arch of the
},
{
    200.44,205.1
     foot and into the ball of the foot. Again, pushing down, push your knee forwards
},
{
    205.1,216.1
     as close to the wall as you can. Keep pushing and holding and ease off slowly. Now ideally
},
{
    216.1,219.9
     you'll be holding each of those stretches for at least 30 seconds, maybe more if you've
},
{
    219.9,225.2
     got the time to, and repeating them a couple of times each, maybe two or three times throughout
},
{
    225.2,230.0
     the day. When you start out, start out really gently because the muscles are likely to be
},
{
    230.0,234.84
     really tight. So just start gently and do what feels comfortable. Some people find that
},
{
    234.84,238.96
     they stretch best when their muscles are already warm, so you might have been for a five minute
},
{
    238.96,243.76
     walk and then do your stretches after that. So I hope those stretches help you out and
},
{
    243.76,250.72
     if we review what we've just done, we did the heel in, the leg up, with the heels straight, we turned the
},
{
    250.72,258.56
     toes out, then we turned the toes in and then we bent the knee forward. So go back to stretches
},
{
    258.56,263.92
     and I hope those exercises help you address calf muscle tightness that's contributing
},
{
    263.92,265.28
     to tight
},
{
    265.28,269.64
     plantar fascia and plantar fasciitis. For more exercises feel welcome to visit
