     Hey everybody it's Doctor Jo and today I'm going to show you some stretches for your
},
{
    3.28,6.56
     wrist flexors and extensors. So let's get started.
},
{
    7.28,9.2
     Disclaimer alert, disclaimer alert.
},
{
    12.24,17.36
     Before we start, if you haven't subscribed already, make sure and click on the button over there.
},
{
    17.36,24.24
     So for the wrist flexors and extensors, we're going to do two stretches each way for 30 seconds.
},
{
    24.24,27.88
     So we'll go up and then down and then up and down again.
},
{
    27.88,30.92
     So I've got a timer set, so it's gonna be 30 seconds
},
{
    30.92,33.96
     and then we're gonna do a little 10 second break in between.
},
{
    33.96,36.56
     So let's go ahead and get started with the stretches
},
{
    36.56,38.86
     for the wrist flexors and extensors.
},
{
    40.6,43.44
     So you're gonna put your hands out in front of you
},
{
    43.44,51.44
     and we'll start with the stretching the wrist extensors first. So just going downwards. So with this if you
},
{
    51.44,56.56
     just hold it this way you get a lot of stretch. If this is too much stretch put
},
{
    56.56,60.48
     your fingers out and it's just a little bit less of a stretch. If you want even
},
{
    60.48,66.08
     more of a stretch you can push in on your hand and curl it in and that will give you
},
{
    66.08,72.4
     even more of a stretch. So after that little 10 second break, these are great if you're working
},
{
    72.4,76.72
     in a desk, especially on a computer for long periods, if you're doing a lot of stuff with your
},
{
    76.72,81.84
     hands, these are really great to do. So now we're going into the wrist flexors. So this time is kind
},
{
    81.84,86.16
     of opposite. If you have your fist in a fist, it's not
},
{
    86.16,90.36
     quite as much of a stretch, but if you open up your hands, you get even more of a stretch
},
{
    90.36,96.2
     and you feel it under there. So again, if you want more stretch than that, you can just
},
{
    96.2,102.88
     do a little pull, gentle pull on each side, or you can put your hand up on a wall. So
},
{
    102.88,106.62
     any kind of work with your hands a lot these muscles get really
},
{
    106.62,112.08
     tired so it's great for these. If you're an artist or a guitar player that works
},
{
    112.08,116.9
     really well as well. And if you want a little bit more you can stretch three
},
{
    116.9,122.46
     on each side but this is just to kind of give you an idea. So again curling down
},
{
    122.46,125.94
     with your fingers to get a lot of stretch, opening
},
{
    125.94,129.04
     them up if you just want a little bit of a stretch. And if you want a little bit
},
{
    129.04,134.28
     of over pressure you can push it into a wall or you can just kind of alternate
},
{
    134.28,140.2
     back and forth giving a little pressure with your other hand that way. But again
},
{
    140.2,145.0
     this is probably enough if they're sore and tired.
},
{
    145.2,147.2
     Getting that good stretch in there.
},
{
    149.08,150.24
     And then take a little break.
},
{
    150.24,151.88
     Sometimes you wanna shake them out a little bit
},
{
    151.88,154.24
     cause it feels like a big stretch in there.
},
{
    154.24,157.28
     And then we're gonna do one more going upwards.
},
{
    157.28,162.28
     So hands out, up almost into a stop sign position.
},
{
    162.92,165.12
     So getting that nice stretch.
},
{
    165.12,166.38
     And so when you're up,
},
{
    166.38,169.08
     stretching out the wrist flexors underneath,
},
{
    169.08,170.6
     and then when you're down,
},
{
    170.6,173.6
     you're stretching those wrist extensors up on top.
},
{
    173.6,177.82
     So stop sign, getting that nice stretch in there.
},
{
    179.96,183.54
     Remember if you don't want quite as much, make a fist.
},
{
    185.08,188.84
     And then more, and then over pressure.
},
{
    190.8,192.92
     So there you have it, those were your stretches
},
{
    192.92,195.44
     for your wrist flexors and extensors.
},
{
    195.44,197.76
     This is actually a part of an office series
},
{
    197.76,200.26
     where I give you a bunch of different stretches
},
{
    200.26,203.72
     from head to toe, and if you're sitting in an office,
},
{
    203.72,207.74
     or even if you're working at home, or doing something where you're sitting for a long period these are easy
},
{
    207.74,211.66
