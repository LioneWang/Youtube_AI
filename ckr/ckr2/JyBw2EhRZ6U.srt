     In this video we're going to go over how to quickly fix lower back and sciatica pain in bed. Stay tuned.

    11.44,18.16
     Hey everyone, Dr. O here at SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. So in this video we're going to help ease
},
{
    18.16,25.84
     lower back pain and sciatica pain all in the comfort of your own bed. The great part about these exercises, they're
},
{
    25.84,31.08
     very easy to do and can give relief in as little as 30 seconds. They don't require any
},
{
    31.08,36.12
     special equipment. And again, what we're going to focus on is quick pain relief through a
},
{
    36.12,41.72
     very safe way of taking pressure out of the lower back. I'm going to show you different
},
{
    41.72,49.44
     variations of stretches, so make sure to give them all a try and go with the ones that you feel are the most effective towards lowering your lower
},
{
    49.44,51.76
     back pain or sciatica pain.
},
{
    51.76,53.32
     So let's get started with them.
},
{
    53.32,57.84
     This first exercise we're going to do in a two-part progression, going from a lighter
},
{
    57.84,61.48
     stretch to a more intense one in the lower back.
},
{
    61.48,66.26
     What we want to do, lay flat on our back in bed, put our legs together, take our arms
},
{
    66.26,68.34
     and anchor ourselves down.
},
{
    68.34,73.24
     What I'm going to do is take the knees and then put rotation to the lower back by taking
},
{
    73.24,75.1
     them to one side.
},
{
    75.1,80.24
     When I do this, I just go very slowly with it and I want to try to keep my bottom or
},
{
    80.24,83.74
     my hips flat as possible on the bed.
},
{
    83.74,86.28
     Only go towards a stretch that feels comfortable.
},
{
    86.28,87.96
     This should not cause any discomfort.
},
{
    87.96,90.96
     If it does, please discontinue immediately.
},
{
    90.96,95.36
     When I get to that point where it's a very good stretch, I hold that for three seconds.
},
{
    95.36,100.48
     I then simply come back up to the middle and then repeat on the other side.
},
{
    100.48,104.32
     You want to do 10 repetitions on each side.
},
{
    104.32,108.46
     Just feel for it to give a lot more mobility into the lower back.
},
{
    108.46,112.54
     It's going to take a lot of pressure off of the muscles, the soft tissue, and those spinal
},
{
    112.54,118.08
     discs which hopefully will give you quick pain relief and also hopefully off that sciatic
},
{
    118.08,119.08
     nerve.
},
{
    119.08,123.44
     So from there we can build into a stronger stretch that's really going to help mobilize
},
{
    123.44,125.4
     the lower back and take pressure
},
{
    125.4,129.76
     off those spinal discs that may be causing sciatic pain down the leg.
},
{
    129.76,134.16
     What we're going to do is just lower one leg completely straight and then I'm going to take
},
{
    134.16,137.88
     the hand on the opposite side of the leg that I'm focusing on that would have the sciatic
},
{
    137.88,141.2
     pain and I'm going to hook it right behind just like this.
},
{
    141.2,143.64
     I want my knee at about 90 degrees.
},
{
    143.64,150.38
     What we do is just simply start to rotate that leg towards the opposite direction and you just keep
},
{
    150.38,155.12
     pulling it down until you feel a very good stretch only to our comfort level.
},
{
    155.12,160.0
     This should not cause any more discomfort. If it does please discontinue. And
},
{
    160.0,164.0
     then from there what you're going to do is hold that for about 15 seconds and
},
{
    164.0,166.56
     this is how we're going to intensify the stretch.
},
{
    166.56,168.76
     Take one arm, straighten it like this,
},
{
    168.76,172.24
     and then slowly start to rotate the upper body
},
{
    172.24,174.84
     and your head towards the opposite direction.
},
{
    174.84,178.12
     So my upper body is rotating towards my left,
},
{
    178.12,180.04
     while this leg right here, my left leg,
},
{
    180.04,182.08
     is going towards the opposite direction.
},
{
    182.08,184.44
     And I tell you what, it feels great.
},
{
    184.44,188.34
     This is a wonderful way to get a lot more mobility
},
{
    188.34,191.14
     into the lower back that will help decrease pain
},
{
    191.14,194.16
     and take pressure off the spinal discs
},
{
    194.16,196.0
     and that sciatic nerve.
},
{
    196.0,199.34
     Hold this one 15 seconds, just simply relax,
},
{
    199.34,201.96
     do it upwards to five times, and if you feel comfortable,
},
{
    201.96,204.94
     you can go to the other leg and do the same thing.
},
{
    204.94,209.66
     For this next exercise, we're also going to do a two-part progression from a lighter stretch
},
{
    209.66,212.24
     into a more advanced stretch.
},
{
    212.24,215.92
     What I'm going to do is lay flat on my stomach for this one.
},
{
    215.92,218.6
     We're going to do what's called a half cobra pose.
},
{
    218.6,223.9
     If you're familiar with that yoga pose it's a very good way to put extension or backwards
},
{
    223.9,227.26
     motion into the lumbar spine to take pressure
},
{
    227.26,231.78
     off the back, especially those spinal discs that can pinch onto the sciatic nerve causing
},
{
    231.78,232.78
     sciatica.
},
{
    232.78,239.02
     So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to simply lift my upper body up like this.
},
{
    239.02,244.06
     And this right here should put a very good stretch into the lower back.
},
{
    244.06,249.44
     Try to keep the pelvic floor and the hips as flat as possible on the bed.
},
{
    249.44,254.64
     You want to hold this position upwards to 30 seconds if possible.
},
{
    254.64,260.44
     You can also lower yourself and you can also go all the way into full extension depending
},
{
    260.44,261.84
     on your comfort level.
},
{
    261.84,264.4
     Again, only go to your comfort level.
},
{
    264.4,268.92
     If you find that this is too intense, you can also just prop yourself up on your elbows
},
{
    268.92,274.28
     like this and then progress into fully extending the arms. So once you feel
},
{
    274.28,278.76
     comfortable doing this, let's move on to the more advanced style stretch. What I'm
},
{
    278.76,283.64
     going to do is whatever side that I'm having pain on, especially like a left
},
{
    283.64,286.88
     sided sciatica pain, I'm going to move
},
{
    286.88,293.18
     over towards the edge of the bed and then put that leg off just like this.
},
{
    293.18,294.76
     Just let gravity take it.
},
{
    294.76,298.9
     And then from there, what I'm going to do is I'm going to lift the leg up towards my
},
{
    298.9,303.0
     upper body as much as I feel comfortable doing so.
},
{
    303.0,306.18
     And from there, go back into that cobra pose.
},
{
    306.18,308.24
     Start off on your elbows right here,
},
{
    308.24,311.08
     and I tell you what, you're going to feel a lot more tension
},
{
    311.08,313.38
     being taken off that sciatic nerve
},
{
    313.38,317.26
     on whatever side the leg is off the bed.
},
{
    317.26,318.56
     And if you feel comfortable,
},
{
    318.56,321.3
     just kind of build into that cobra pose right there,
},
{
    321.3,323.06
     and it, tell you what, it feels like
},
{
    323.06,324.82
     a very good stretch right here.
},
{
    324.82,329.0
     But just hold this one for upwards to 15 to 30 seconds simply just
},
{
    329.0,333.66
     relax and then at that point do it upwards to five times. So give all these
},
{
    333.66,337.48
     exercises a try I really do hope that they give you a lot of lower back pain
},
{
    337.48,341.32
     and sciatica pain relief and go with the ones that you feel are the most
},
{
    341.32,344.48
