     Hi everyone, Bob is here with another video. If you are experiencing back pain, one of
},
{
    11.32,16.48
     the way that can improve your symptoms can be strengthening your core. Today I would
},
{
    16.48,21.86
     like to share with you a couple of exercises that can help you to improve your core strength.
},
{
    21.86,25.5
     This exercise can be done at home without any equipment.
},
{
    25.5,26.5
     Let's go through them.
},
{
    27.66,29.88
     Before I show you the exercises,
},
{
    29.88,33.96
     I would like to explain for you what is core means.
},
{
    33.96,36.14
     Core muscles are a group of muscle
},
{
    36.14,40.0
     that extend beyond our only abs and our torso.
},
{
    40.0,42.36
     They're basically involved in most of the movements
},
{
    42.36,43.88
     that we do.
},
{
    43.88,48.76
     Core muscles are dynamic and a static stabilizer of movement.
},
{
    48.76,54.56
     They basically help us to create force from one extremity to another, and in some cases
},
{
    54.56,55.76
     they create movement.
},
{
    55.76,61.48
     By the end of this video, you will learn more about core muscles and how they can help you
},
{
    61.48,63.76
     to improve your symptoms.
},
{
    63.76,65.2
     Let's go through the first exercise and you can see how you to improve your symptoms. Let's go through the first exercise
},
{
    65.2,69.92
     and you can see how you can start your routine. The first exercise that I would like to share with
},
{
    69.92,75.44
     you guys is going to be back extension. This exercise will strengthen your lower back,
},
{
    75.44,80.32
     your rectus spinal, which is the muscle that goes along your back from neck all the way down to your
},
{
    80.32,86.36
     sacrum. And also you can engage your glute muscle which can actually help you to strengthen
},
{
    86.36,92.28
     both at the same time. Let's go through the exercise and we can progress them step by step.
},
{
    92.28,97.36
     Now the first version that you're going to do, you're basically going to lie down on
},
{
    97.36,106.72
     your belly, face down. My neck is in neutral position. I'm trying to use my hand. My foot are engaged with the ground and lifting
},
{
    106.72,113.36
     my body slightly up. I'm not using my full force from my arms. I'm trying to assist this movement,
},
{
    113.36,118.96
     extension slightly with my arms, but at the same time I'm engaging my lower back muscle
},
{
    122.8,126.32
     and holding it there for five seconds. Four, three, two, and relax.
},
{
    127.44,132.44
     These muscles are primarily used in this exercise.
},
{
    132.64,133.84
     You can do one more round.
},
{
    135.68,140.68
     Five, four, three, two, and relax.
},
{
    142.16,146.92
     Now, you can try this exercises for three sets of five and
},
{
    146.92,152.88
     whenever you find that five is easy you gotta actually hold them for five
},
{
    152.88,157.36
     seconds in each rep. You can progress that maybe to eight repetition and
},
{
    157.36,165.76
     progress step by step. The second version of this exercise that become a little more difficult you're
},
{
    165.76,172.76
     going to get the same movement but you would like to come slightly higher which
},
{
    172.76,178.72
     means I'm still using my arms but I'm engaging slightly my glutes in this
},
{
    178.72,185.0
     movement as well which means I'm bringing my back up off the ground.
},
{
    185.4,188.6
     I'm engaging the glutes holding it there for five seconds,
},
{
    188.6,192.8
     four, three, two, and relax.
},
{
    194.2,195.6
     I'm gonna do it one more round.
},
{
    198.12,203.12
     Five, four, three, two, and relax.
},
{
    205.52,210.72
     While you're doing this exercise, make sure that your tempo is slow, same as exactly
},
{
    210.72,211.88
     what I'm doing.
},
{
    211.88,217.08
     You don't want to create a very sharp and jerky movements during this exercise.
},
{
    217.08,220.36
     Now how can we progress it from there?
},
{
    220.36,223.12
     It's basically not using your arms.
},
{
    223.12,226.84
     Whenever you felt comfortable that you can actually keep your arms off the ground
},
{
    227.36,230.22
     You can actually keep your arms behind your back and
},
{
    231.24,233.24
     slightly as you can see I'm
},
{
    233.8,235.96
     lifting my chest off the ground
},
{
    236.96,239.46
     Holding it there for five seconds for
},
{
    240.16,241.44
     three
},
{
    241.44,243.44
     two and relax
},
{
    245.32,247.24
     3, 2, and relax. Catch your breath guys, relax.
},
{
    247.24,248.6
     You don't need to do them quickly.
},
{
    248.6,251.68
     You're going to go one more round.
},
{
    251.68,258.44
     5, 4, 3, 2, and relax.
},
{
    258.44,264.04
     The following progression would be holding your hands here in front of your body which
},
{
    264.04,265.16
     give you more weights to
},
{
    265.16,277.6
     actually carry up and perform the same exercise. 5, 4, 3, 2 and relax. Now while
},
{
    277.6,282.32
     you're doing this exercise guys as you can see I'm lifting my arms off the
},
{
    282.32,286.12
     ground and with lifting that movement it actually
},
{
    286.12,290.16
     engage my upper back muscles group as well which is kind of give you a
},
{
    290.16,294.6
     combination of muscle that works at the same time. Now I'm gonna show you the
},
{
    294.6,299.32
     following progression which become more kind of like basically you're lifting
},
{
    299.32,303.52
     your chest off and your legs off the ground which kind of engage your glutes
},
{
    303.52,305.84
     and your lower back at the same times.
},
{
    306.28,311.36
     This can be your last progression that you do whenever you felt comfortable and
},
{
    312.2,313.96
     relax and
},
{
    313.96,315.96
     coming back up again
},
{
    316.16,319.88
     five, four, three, two
},
{
    321.32,323.32
     and relax.
},
{
    323.56,328.04
     This is the first exercise that you can play around for a while guys. Don't rush it.
},
{
    328.56,334.84
     Make sure you're spending time learning the exercise, watching this video a couple of times and to get the right tips.
},
{
    335.48,337.48
     Let's go through the second exercise.
},
{
    337.76,342.68
     The following exercise that I'm going to show you guys is a progression of the first exercise back extension.
},
{
    342.84,349.64
     We call it kick back and it's going to be basically strengthening your core while you basically using your
},
{
    349.64,353.92
     glute muscles. I'm going to show you the exercise and you can give it a try. Now
},
{
    353.92,359.26
     for this exercise you're going to be on the quadruped position which means your
},
{
    359.26,363.32
     hands going to be under your shoulders and your knees going to be under your
},
{
    363.32,370.24
     hip and you're trying to basically engage your core and not trying to drop the core down. Core is
},
{
    370.24,375.66
     engaged and while I'm trying to minimize any movement on my lower back and upper
},
{
    375.66,394.12
     body I'm trying to create a kick movement back and move forward. As you can see I'm doing it pretty slow. Up kick, four more and five.
},
{
    394.12,400.08
     Now as you can see the muscle that works primarily here is going to be my glute muscle,
},
{
    400.08,408.78
     that leg that I'm actually creating that kick, but at the same times I'm engaging my core to minimize the movement in my upper extremity and lower
},
{
    408.78,412.78
     extremity, which means if I'm doing this exercise I'm going to show you with the
},
{
    412.78,432.2
     other leg, I'm trying
},
{
    432.2,438.0
     to breathe in and out while I'm doing this exercise and I'm going to show you the version
},
{
    438.0,447.84
     that you shouldn't do. You're trying to not do this exercise this way which means your whole body move and you're trying to basically
},
{
    449.92,456.48
     just kick back. Now we want to minimize the movement and we're trying to slowly control
},
{
    457.44,466.92
     and right now I can feel my basically abdominal muscles are engaged, my back muscles are engaged, I'm breathing in
},
{
    466.92,474.88
     and out and I'm trying to minimize that jerky movement and basically too much movement.
},
{
    474.88,479.82
     Now while you're doing this exercise guys make sure to watch this video for a couple
},
{
    479.82,480.82
     of times.
},
{
    480.82,488.44
     Do it slow control, start with three sets of five. Whenever you felt comfortable,
},
{
    488.44,493.04
     maybe progress them to eight, but initially you want to do them for both sides. And when
},
{
    493.04,497.8
     you're doing this exercise, you definitely want to engage your glutes at the end range,
},
{
    497.8,504.64
     which means when your foot gets to the end range, I can feel my glute muscles are actually
},
{
    504.64,506.92
     working. Now give it a try this
},
{
    506.92,511.16
     exercise guys and I'm going to show you now the third exercise that you're going to do
},
{
    511.16,515.52
     in this routine. The following exercise that I'm going to show you guys is going to be
},
{
    515.52,520.96
     Bear Dogs. This exercise can help you to move your upper body and lower body while you're
},
{
    520.96,525.08
     engaging your basically core. I'm going to show you with the easiest version
},
{
    525.08,527.92
     and slowly progress it to the more difficult version.
},
{
    527.92,533.56
     Now you're going to be on the quad pad position and in this exercise you're basically going
},
{
    533.56,547.2
     to do alternate arms and legs movement. As you can see it's similar to kick back but while I'm basically creating movement on my legs I'm
},
{
    547.2,553.88
     breathing my opposite arms up. Now as you can see I'm not going all the way up I'm not
},
{
    553.88,569.36
     arching my back I'm doing it pretty in a gentle slow movement control back slow control back and while I'm doing it my core is engaged I'm trying to
},
{
    569.36,578.78
     beat in and out showing you the other side, slow control back all the up, slow
},
{
    578.78,587.56
     control back. You can try this exercise again, initially maybe just start to bring your arms slightly
},
{
    587.56,595.88
     up and back again, up and back again to get more comfortable with the movement.
},
{
    595.88,603.08
     And whenever you felt your balancing coordination is good, then you can perform the full movement
},
{
    603.08,606.52
     and come back which means you can start with here maybe
},
{
    606.52,613.84
     slowly progress the movement and whenever you felt comfortable you want to
},
{
    613.84,619.24
     do the same tempo slow control and you want to do it for both sides which
},
{
    619.24,629.04
     means you do let's say four or five on one side Whenever you feel comfortable you go for a full range
},
{
    630.12,632.56
     and breathing in and out and
},
{
    635.24,637.56
     You can try the same routine basically now
},
{
    638.44,642.76
     How many reps and repetition you can do in this exercise? It's similar
},
{
    642.96,644.96
     It's totally up to your own level
},
{
    646.32,652.88
     you can do in this exercise, it's similar. It's totally up to your own level. Maybe start with three sets of even three each side for three sets and slowly progress them to five. As I showed you,
},
{
    653.52,659.92
     start with the minimum range, slowly get more range. Now while you're doing this movement, again,
},
{
    659.92,666.46
     minimize the jerky movement and speak. That's so important while you're engaging your core
},
{
    666.46,670.96
     to create those actually slow step-step movements.
},
{
    670.96,672.92
     Let's go through the fourth exercise.
},
{
    672.92,674.8
     The following exercise and our last exercise
},
{
    674.8,677.34
     that I'm gonna show you, it's gonna be dead box.
},
{
    677.34,679.26
     This exercise can be pretty challenging
},
{
    679.26,681.02
     in comparison to the first three exercise
},
{
    681.02,682.16
     that I showed you.
},
{
    682.16,685.52
     That's why you can slowly build up to the last exercise
},
{
    685.52,687.2
     and whenever you felt comfortable,
},
{
    687.2,688.48
     you can try this routine.
},
{
    688.48,691.64
     Now, you're gonna lie down on your back
},
{
    691.64,696.04
     and my arms gonna be straight, knees and hip
},
{
    696.04,699.36
     on the 90 degrees and we're trying to basically
},
{
    699.36,704.08
     initially start with the movement from one side.
},
{
    704.08,711.76
     As you can see the speed slow, slow control back and move back.
},
{
    712.72,718.16
     Now one of the most important things in this movement volume in this position I'm trying to
},
{
    718.96,725.28
     keep my back engaged with the ground which means my back doesn't come off the ground which
},
{
    725.28,729.68
     means I can't put in my hands here while I'm doing these successors. In some
},
{
    729.68,734.6
     cases if you even put some towel or something here that actually to you can
},
{
    734.6,738.44
     feel your lower back and basically engage your lower back while you're doing
},
{
    738.44,748.52
     the successors. I'm going to show you one more round, slow control back, move forward, slow control back,
},
{
    748.52,754.6
     move forward and again you don't need to go all the way down, you can go up to here, back
},
{
    754.6,768.32
     again, change side, go up to here, back again, slow breathing and out.
},
{
    768.32,769.6
     Don't hold your breath.
},
{
    769.6,773.0
     Same tempo.
},
{
    773.0,774.0
     Back again.
},
{
    774.0,778.32
     Now, what you need to exercise, again, speed is important, guys.
},
{
    778.32,779.84
     Keep it as slow.
},
{
    779.84,781.92
     Work around your own ability.
},
{
    781.92,783.24
     Don't force it.
},
{
    783.24,785.72
     Maybe start for a couple of repetition and
},
{
    785.72,790.96
     rest between sets guys. You can easily rest between every set for at least like
},
{
    790.96,795.2
     30 seconds or sometimes a minute for all the exercise guys. This is not a very
},
{
    795.2,798.84
     hardcore routine. You can rest as much as you need and then you can go for another
},
{
    798.84,806.84
     set. Now I'm gonna show you how to progress that if you felt comfortable with that you can create the alternate basically
},
{
    807.74,809.44
     movement which means
},
{
    809.44,811.84
     my opposite arms and
},
{
    813.52,814.68
     Opposite
},
{
    814.68,816.68
     foot moves
},
{
    816.68,819.52
     I'm still trying to engage my core
},
{
    821.04,823.72
     Volume doing this exercise. I'm gonna change side
},
{
    827.5,833.08
     This can definitely challenge your coordination while you're doing this exercise. I definitely felt
},
{
    833.08,837.44
     difficult initially when I start to practice this exercise and it takes me
},
{
    837.44,845.44
     a good while to actually get comfortable with it. Now again while you're doing this exercise you're trying to engage
},
{
    845.44,853.6
     that hip tilt through the whole movement. I believe this exercise can help you to
},
{
    853.6,860.28
     improve your back symptoms and pain but you got to watch this exercise if any
},
{
    860.28,870.8
     of the exercises while you're doing them doesn't feel comfortable for you, I would suggest to not doing them or maybe do them in a very gentle way, which means do
},
{
    870.8,875.16
     them maybe for a couple of repetitions and slowly build up to the point that you feel
},
{
    875.16,876.88
     more comfortable.
},
{
    876.88,881.96
     One of the biggest errors that I've seen most of my clients and patients do them is they
},
{
    881.96,885.04
     holding their breath and they tensing everywhere when
},
{
    885.04,889.36
     you're doing these exercises and I would suggest you to focus on your
},
{
    889.36,894.6
     breathing while you're doing these exercises. I hope you guys find this
