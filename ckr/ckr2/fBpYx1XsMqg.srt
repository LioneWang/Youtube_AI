},
{
    15.88,21.84
     60-second stretches to get the knots from your shoulders and your traps and your upper back
},
{
    21.84,25.6
     Oh, you know, it's kind of the tension area of the body for a lot of people.
},
{
    25.6,30.16
     It shows up there doesn't it? So and we know you don't have time for this, you don't have time for pain

},
{
    36.02,40.28
     ornery, we don't need that. I'm glad you said ornery, not whatever.
},
{
    40.92,45.88

     fit, pain-free and we upload every day.
},
{
    53.6,54.44
     Excellent.
},
{
    54.44,56.64
     Here we go, first one Brad is just a simple one.
},
{
    56.64,58.54
     This is the one you can do throughout the day.
},
{
    58.54,61.12
     Not only does it kind of release the tension a little bit
},
{
    61.12,62.4
     but it puts you in good posture.
},
{
    62.4,63.24
     Sure.
},
{
    63.24,64.52
     So what you're gonna do is you're gonna bring your shoulders
},
{
    64.52,70.28
     up, you're gonna bring them back and you're gonna squeeze them together one two three four five and relax
},
{
    70.88,77.48
     Up back squeeze together one two three four five and down. Do you have to go like this? It helps
},
{
    77.88,79.88
     It does
},
{
    80.84,86.68
     I just wonder when to clarify it Bob. All right next one Brad, this one's a little more complicated
},
{
    86.68,91.06
     So you're gonna have to follow along, okay, I'll do it. So you're gonna elevate the shoulder
},
{
    92.0,94.0
     Yeah, this one he doesn't even like this one I don't think
},
{
    94.88,97.96
     Elevate the shoulder bring it back bring the neck back
},
{
    98.8,102.32
     Ear to shoulder and then turn away and it tighten
},
{
    102.68,109.52
     while you're doing it So it's tightening all these muscles that are already tight and the idea is if you tighten them up
},
{
    109.52,114.12
     You max and you fatigue it out, then it will relax afterwards
},
{
    114.12,118.96
     Okay, I'll do this one one more time on this side. So you're bringing the shoulder up back
},
{
    119.48,120.72
     neck back
},
{
    120.72,123.52
     Ear to shoulder turn away tighten
},
{
    124.52,129.5
     You're turning away from the shoulder. Yeah, you got to make the face too Brad.
},
{
    129.5,138.44
     Okay, so we're gonna do the other one now. Shoulder up, back, neck back, ear to shoulder and tighten.
},
{
    138.44,146.1
     There's a lot of little turns. We one, we'll have a test on that next week
},
{
    146.1,149.7
     All right another one is again this one works for posture
},
{
    149.7,155.84
     But it also a lot of times the knots are coming from the neck and so we want you to do some chin tucks
},
{
    155.84,161.22
     We've shown these a million times haven't we Brad? Well at least a million, it sounds like a broken record
},
{
    161.22,163.22
     Yeah, you know, stand by
},
{
    163.22,168.52
     Chin tucks and then you're gonna go ahead and work on some extension too because a lot of times that'll help
},
{
    169.0,174.56
     relieve it and if not, if that doesn't feel good, you might do it with a towel.
},
{
    174.56,178.68
     I brought a towel over already. Oh Bob, thank you. I knew you'd get something for me
},
{
    183.8,192.2
     Yeah It may not seem like it, but sometimes and it may not be immediate
},
{
    192.2,196.4
     but you keep doing these and you may find out over a day or two that it
},
{
    196.4,200.56
     starts taking the knots out of your shoulders. If nothing else it's good
},
{
    200.56,204.88
     for your neck and it's also good for your posture. If for some reason you do
},
{
    204.88,208.3
     that and you get some sharp pains or get some other unusual pains
},
{
    208.92,212.54
     Then it may not be for you, but for the majority of people it's gonna be fine
},
{
    212.54,214.72
     Now this is the one I've said many times
},
{
    214.72,219.46
     This is the one that's worked for me and especially if I start getting some pain up in here
},
{
    219.46,225.4
     I do the chin tuck and then I bend to that side and that's all I do and I do it repeatedly
},
{
    225.64,230.04
     You know like I'll do it every hour, you know 10 to 15 times
},
{
    231.04,234.4
     And I know I have a feeling of people are gonna say they're gonna do that
},
{
    234.4,238.42
     But they say yeah, but it's stretching the muscle over here. Yeah, and that's not the idea
},
{
    238.42,240.42
     We're working on the joints of the neck
},
{
    241.12,245.04
     And that what may be sending the pain down into your neck. I wouldn't do
},
{
    245.04,249.72
     any of these if they really start to hurt like I wouldn't be doing these into
},
{
    249.72,255.0
     the pain range and these two if this makes it worse stop and you might even
},
{
    255.0,258.52
     try the other direction. I mean you could go a couple three times in a mace
},
{
    258.52,262.88
     beer to the water but after that it should start clearly improving. You want
},
{
    262.88,266.7
     to say oh that is the answer isn't it? That feels better
},
{
    266.7,273.96
     When I do that. Smile on your face. Alright next one Brad. This is one you probably can't do in the office very easy
},
{
    276.44,282.36
     I don't know maybe I don't know what your office is like maybe you can do it. We're gonna do cat and camel here
},
{
    282.48,284.48
     So
},
{
    284.6,289.02
     Some people are gonna call this sells but we're sticking the cat and camel on this right?
},
{
    289.02,289.82
     What do they call it?
},
{
    289.82,295.44
     Well, I always get confused and I always apologize to the yoga people, but we're gonna call this the cat and camel.
},
{
    295.44,298.84
     They have a name for it, huh? Right there. We're doing it wrong.
},
{
    298.84,300.24
     And to really
},
{
    300.24,304.56
     Accessibly do it you want to go ahead and go head down and then head up like this.
},
{
    304.56,309.8
     Yeah, it's kind of hard to see here with Bob's shirt but if we pull it down,
},
{
    309.8,315.4
     you know he's getting that arch in the back. We're getting full range of motion throughout the back.
},
{
    315.4,320.72
     Yeah quite often some of that knots can be coming from the mid-back, the thoracic area,
},
{
    320.72,325.64
     so you want to go ahead and do that. I would say even extensions over
},
{
    326.52,330.96
     the hallelujah stretch over the, we should probably have a ball though, shouldn't we?
},
{
    337.96,341.8
     You're hoping you didn't have to use it. He always doesn't tell me so I could get the real ball.
},
{
    341.8,349.4
     I always have to use the one that It's a therapy for Bob though because he knows the Packers are gonna win and beat the rake
},
{
    349.4,351.9
     They're a football team in case you don't know
},
{
    351.9,354.84
     This is actually, it works good this padlock ball
},
{
    355.66,358.22
     I told you, it's actually a good ball for it
},
{
    358.22,362.86
     One that won't work good is like a basketball or something hard like they need something with some squish
},
{
    362.86,366.36
     This actually is a really good one for not spread because
},
{
    366.48,371.22
     You can work it up and down the spine and get the different areas of it so it works out quite well
},
{
    371.74,373.74
     All right, where are we at next one?
},
{
    374.24,376.24
     Let's go ahead and do the wall ones
},
{
    376.84,378.84
     Lonnie can you get adjusted over here?
},
{
    380.48,386.48
     Again this works on posture and believe it you know quite often posture is the problem with a knots
},
{
    386.96,393.04
     So this is tightening up all the muscles strengthening the muscles and and hopefully maybe giving you some relief
},
{
    393.04,394.88
     We can just do wall angels
},
{
    394.88,397.84
     So you're gonna bring them up and then down
},
{
    398.36,400.36
     Just it's tightening all the muscles
},
{
    400.36,404.76
     This doesn't say that Bob is an angel by any means but you know it's good to try
},
{
    405.8,412.52
     See it was getting those shots. Yeah, it really is stretching everything too. I'll tell you. These feel better than you think they do Brad
},
{
    412.52,417.52
     Oh, I believe it, right? I'll try it. Yeah, I'll try it. Yeah try it.
},
{
    419.32,424.48
     Because this is one I've got those tight shoulders, you know, this is pretty challenging for me
},
{
    424.48,425.96
     But I should probably do this more
},
{
    426.36,432.44
     I've been working on my pull-ups Bob. Yeah, those are great. I actually like the feel of these. Yeah, it definitely works well
},
{
    432.88,434.64
     Good option
},
{
    434.64,440.48
     Another one you can just put your hands behind your head elbows to the wall and you're gonna go ahead and stretch like this
},
{
    440.76,443.84
     This is a really nice one for that thoracic area
},
{
    447.76,453.28
     like this. This is a really nice one for that thoracic area. Again you find out which ones work for you and those are the ones you do. Right exactly. Which ones you like? Do you got the ball
},
{
    453.28,461.12
     in the sock Brad? Oh of course Bob. You want to show that one? Rather than whip it at me. So what we
},
{
    461.12,465.0
     have is a lacrosse ball, a tennis ball works just as well
},
{
    465.48,469.4
     Depends on what you like, lacrosse ball is a little harder, a little more aggressive
},
{
    469.4,473.64
     But the reason you put it in the sock is not to use it for a weapon but
},
{
    474.32,478.4
     To put it on your back and you got to put it over that muscle right there
},
{
    479.32,484.44
     Get it over that trigger point and between the wall and that trigger point is the ball and
},
{
    484.92,490.14
     The sock is just so you can position it and once it's there you don't need the sock and right there I'm on it
},
{
    490.14,496.38
     Yeah, and once you get on it you can feel it you can kind of massage the area like that or you can just put the pressure on it
},
{
    496.38,502.32
     And hold it and try to get that trigger point released. I'm really hitting a spot right now
},
{
    502.88,508.72
     It really does. It does get it good though. I'm telling you. It hitting a spot right now It really does Brad while you're going through your it does get it good though. I'm not
},
{
    508.72,512.0
     It's a spot. I gotta get up over here. Let's go to the next one. I could be here all day
},
{
    512.0,516.08
     Next one foam roller. This is a really nice foam roller from OPTP
},
{
    516.48,522.96
     Do they get that plug in good Brad? Yeah, it really is. It's a little softer. Yeah about foam roller
},
{
    522.96,530.92
     Yeah, it's the softest one I've seen. It's different materials too. I think they make one a little softer, I have a foam roller, softest one I've seen. I think they make one a little softer than that, that might be the medium density
},
{
    530.92,533.64
     I think they have a low one too. This is like a rubber almost.
},
{
    534.52,537.16
     Look at the color Bob, it makes you smile.
},
{
    537.44,542.58
     So you can definitely work things, you can lift up the butt and really work
},
{
    542.58,547.1
     the upper shoulders here and work down into this range in here
},
{
    548.08,554.26
     They make a higher density. I said this one is it's notably harder and it's a little more aggressive and some people do like that
},
{
    554.26,558.4
     But do you do this one Brad? Do you just lie on the roll? Yep, I like that
},
{
    558.4,566.68
     Very relaxing and this by the way is also from OPTP. It's called the Pro Roller Arch and this works nice for this type of
},
{
    567.84,569.36
     activity.
},
{
    569.36,576.76
     I will do the roll just like you did Bob on my upper back. Sure and this is why I like the three foot one because
},
{
    577.28,579.28
     this is one of those things that's
},
{
    579.44,580.72
     when things are
},
{
    580.72,585.6
     you just want to relax and let the posture go back like this and I
},
{
    585.6,589.92
     usually go without this but there are people that are gonna find that
},
{
    589.92,594.48
     that's a little too far down on their head and putting that in there is more
},
{
    594.48,598.96
     comfortable. Yeah and you would actually look better without it. Oh thank you.
},
{
    598.96,604.2
     No for me I like it down like this I can do my chin tucks a little bit there and
},
{
    604.2,609.28
     I'll just I'll just lay here and listen to the music or whatever for you know for a couple of minutes at least
},
{
    609.4,615.8
     This is good for thoracic outlets. Yeah, it just lets those shoulders go back and keeps that spine and good alignment
},
{
    615.8,617.8
     So there you go. All right
},
{
    618.88,624.56
     Couple more products we thought we'd finish up with products, you know that it may be helpful
},
{
    624.56,626.52
     This is the back knobber I believe
},
{
    626.52,633.0
     Yeah, and there's also Theracane. We're not you know particular to one type of cane. They both work well
},
{
    633.0,636.84
     Yeah, this I really like these things. I keep one around the house
},
{
    636.84,640.48
     In fact we have one of the Theracanes around here and
},
{
    641.24,644.84
     My other therapist was just saying that he thinks nursing came and got it because
},
{
    644.84,652.02
     Yeah, they did. They'll come and get it and you can just you can hit the spot you can you can you can hit
},
{
    652.02,656.3
     the spot and even work on turning while you do it that it seems to help I know you like
},
{
    656.3,660.86
     to really like lay down and crank on it don't you Brad like you get like this yeah I don't
},
{
    660.86,664.2
     have one of those at home but if I want to get into something that's what I'll do.
},
{
    664.2,668.0
     This you can really leverage it lay right down once Bob. I'll let you do it
},
{
    668.0,670.48
     Have you, I'm not sure how you do it
},
{
    672.48,676.28
     Oh, I see you're getting your low back on that one. But it can go either way
},
{
    677.36,679.36
     But you know it just takes a, ooh
},
{
    679.44,686.56
     Just a little bit. I mean you got a lot of leverage here, wow this is much more aggressive than the ball on the wall
},
{
    687.48,690.2
     But if I hold that there for a while, it's starting to relax good
},
{
    690.68,695.2
     That's the key to this stuff, okay, all right, well we're coming to the end here Brad
},
{
    695.2,698.84
     I think that's enough things for people to try, hopefully one of them will work and
},
{
    699.3,702.34
     Remember Brad and I can fix just about anything, yeah except for that
},
{
    703.52,706.22
     The broken heart, there it is. Let's hook it.
},
{
    707.72,709.72
     Thanks for watching
},
