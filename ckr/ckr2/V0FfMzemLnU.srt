     Hi, I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist Brad Eineck physical therapist and together we are the most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    6.44,12.08
     In our opinion of course Bob. Pay attention. All right, we're gonna today we're gonna talk about top three ways to treat trigger finger
},
{
    13.32,19.72
     Trigger finger by the way is an overuse injury. It can range from a slight pain to a severe pain and
},
{
    20.96,27.2
     Generally the biggest sign of it is like you'll bend your finger and then as you open it, it snaps open
},
{
    27.44,32.0
     It might give you a little bit of pain. So when you say overuse, give me an example
},
{
    32.4,37.2
     If you're like working on the garden and you're using a clipper and you clip, clip, clip, clip
},
{
    37.92,43.68
     That would do it. A lot of industrial jobs, factory type work really, where you're using the hand over and over again
},
{
    44.24,48.32
     Very common and older women who are menopausal
},
{
    48.32,56.16
     Oh really? Yeah, so that really doesn't have to do with the overuse, but it does hit a
},
{
    57.04,64.7
     group that tends to get it. Because of the calcium issues? I have no idea Brad. Okay, but it very commonly affects the thumb
},
{
    64.7,65.22
     I have no idea Brad. Okay, but it very commonly affects the thumb
},
{
    72.0,72.84
     The ring finger and the middle finger, okay, but it can happen in any finger and it can happen really at almost any
},
{
    74.6,76.6
     joint It's a
},
{
    76.6,79.92
     Should we try to explain this Brad? Sure, let's real quickly. Here's our model here with
},
{
    81.04,83.92
     Leopold, Napoleon, bone apart
},
{
    84.4,88.32
     All right we have a long ligament here or ligaments that run up
},
{
    88.32,93.24
     into your finger here and when you pull on them they actually bend the finger. Right so the muscle
},
{
    93.24,99.4
     is up here when the muscle contracts the tendon now this would be every finger would have this
},
{
    99.4,103.96
     red tendon but they're not red in your body this is just for but if you look at the tendon there's
},
{
    103.96,107.58
     actually two tendons that actually even goes through that. So if you look at that finger
},
{
    108.0,111.42
     See how it's bending it? This is a he pulls on the rope it bends it
},
{
    113.44,120.88
     Goes much easier in real life, of course. Yeah, and these tendons are running underneath this black thing, which is a ligament
},
{
    122.04,128.64
     Yeah, it's an annular ligament and they actually call it a pulley and that pulley helps hold the ligaments in place
},
{
    128.64,138.66
     and this is a very crude model and what we are trying to show right here is a nodule, a nodule has developed on the tendon
},
{
    138.66,145.0
     and that nodule actually gets caught underneath the ligament here. So right there you can see it goes underneath
},
{
    145.42,149.04
     the ligament and then that's where it gets caught and that's when you
},
{
    149.68,154.94
     Extrate the finger then it straight, that's when it pops out. It pops out. Yep. Simple as that.
},
{
    155.12,162.3
     So a little bit difficult to understand but generally if you have let's say trigger finger at this finger right here
},
{
    162.38,169.76
     You're gonna feel a nodule right here quite often. Okay. And so the first treatment you're gonna do is what we
},
{
    169.76,174.52
     call cross fiber massage or transverse friction massage. Basically you're gonna
},
{
    174.52,179.32
     find that nodule in this whole area here and you're gonna rub across it. I don't
},
{
    179.32,186.28
     know how we doing on this man. So you're gonna rub very hard across that. I'm not just hitting the surface here
},
{
    186.28,192.48
     I'm going down really really deep and rubbing. Could you actually put your finger across so you got some support in the back
},
{
    192.48,196.56
     Can push with your thumb and go back and forth? I think you could do that
},
{
    196.56,201.04
     But you really don't need to you can put one finger on top of the other and it just really does the job
},
{
    201.04,209.24
     And how long would you do that for Bob? I would do it two or three minutes longer if you can do up to five even. You're probably gonna get fatigued
},
{
    209.24,212.88
     fingers before you. Your fingers are gonna get fatigued. I would try it every day.
},
{
    212.88,218.64
     I would do it every day. And right after you do the cross fiber massage, and again
},
{
    218.64,223.0
     you're trying to do it on the nodule and you're trying to do it on the ligament.
},
{
    223.0,226.3
     To loosen that up. To loosen it all up because a lot of times
},
{
    226.52,231.66
     This has got problems too. This is tightened up and it's got some scar tissue on it
},
{
    231.66,236.46
     So you want to do that and then right after that I want you to go ahead and stretch the fingers
},
{
    236.46,242.98
     Okay, so you're gonna pull it back like that on that specific finger or if it's the thumb
},
{
    242.98,244.98
     Sure, you can do it on the thumb
},
{
    244.7,244.96
     That specific finger or if it's the thumb sure you can do it on the thumb
},
{
    250.42,254.5
     Any red flags things you should if you feel sharp pain or anything like that should you stop? You should always you know be concerned about that, but really the pain is when you
},
{
    255.0,258.22
     Snaps it when it snaps open that this usually doesn't bother
},
{
    258.22,262.76
     So if you do this for say three days in a row you think they may start to feel some progress
},
{
    262.76,264.76
     Well, we got to see yeah, I mean
},
{
    263.84,271.52
     three days in a row you think they may start to feel some progress. Well we got a seed. The other thing you're going to do then, you can go ahead and actually work the muscles that extend the finger.
},
{
    271.52,277.92
     So you're going to take a rubber band or this one's actually a doubled up rubber band and you're going to put it on your fingers like this
},
{
    279.14,282.72
     around all the fingers and you're just going to work on straightening them like that.
},
{
    283.68,286.1
     It's a nice exercise to strengthen the
},
{
    286.1,290.8
     stencers we call them. And this shouldn't cause any snapping because in order to make it snap,
},
{
    290.8,297.1
     usually you have to make a full fist in order to make it snap to make that tendon or that bump go
},
{
    297.1,307.24
     underneath the leg. So just like this and then finally if you want to when you finish you actually keep the tendons stretched and
},
{
    307.6,309.6
     You can actually do an ice massage
},
{
    310.56,318.44
     Take a little cup like this if you fill it up almost full put it in your freezer let it freeze solid and then you'd simply
},
{
    318.72,322.28
     When the ice is frozen solid in there you tear off the top
},
{
    322.92,325.32
     Like this just enough all the way
},
{
    325.32,330.08
     around so that the ice is exposed and then you would just rub it over there
},
{
    330.08,334.4
     while you're stretching it. Okay for about five minutes is what I usually
},
{
    334.4,338.0
     recommend. Yeah it usually doesn't take much longer. Sometimes it freezes up a
},
{
    338.0,342.4
     lot quicker than that you don't need to go much longer than that. Now if
},
{
    342.4,348.56
     none of these things work then you're gonna need to go to the doctor and he's gonna try, you can do a cortisone shot and
},
{
    348.56,353.6
     a lot of times the cortisone shot does relieve things in 66% of the patients
},
{
    353.6,360.0
     but then it comes back quite often, unfortunately. So a third of those, only
},
{
    360.0,364.72
     a third of those get lasting relief. From the shot? From the shot, yeah and the
},
{
    364.72,365.82
     others have to have surgery
},
{
    365.82,370.44
     It's a simple surgery if there was such a thing but I mean it's an outpatient and
},
{
    371.76,376.72
     They go in and they release the tendon, right so you're gonna go in and leave the same
},
{
    377.72,380.44
     Exactly, so but I mean this is certainly worth a try
},
{
    380.94,382.94
     So you're gonna do the cross-fiber massage
},
{
    383.36,386.92
     You can do the stretch you can do the strengthening and then the ice
},
{
    386.92,391.84
     And give it a shot and see if we can help you trigger finger. Alright nice job Bob. Alright, thanks for watching
