     In this video, I'm going to show you how to relieve neck pain in 30 seconds.
},
{
    4.02,5.02
     Stay tuned.
},
{
    5.02,6.02
     Hey, everyone.
},
{
    6.02,13.24
     Dr. O here at SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan.
},
{
    13.24,18.02
     So in this video, let's tackle neck pain, which is a big problem for a lot of people.
},
{
    18.02,21.42
     Let's face it, we're all guilty of having very bad posture, especially with rounded
},
{
    21.42,25.0
     shoulders from everyday use of cell phones, computers,
},
{
    25.0,26.84
     driving, you name it.
},
{
    26.84,31.88
     So I'm going to show you a very easy step-by-step guide that's going to offer very quick neck
},
{
    31.88,35.04
     pain relief, maybe in as little as 30 seconds.
},
{
    35.04,39.6
     The great part about these stretches and exercises, they don't require any special equipment.
},
{
    39.6,44.68
     The only thing that I'm going to be using are a towel and an everyday broomstick.
},
{
    44.68,46.56
     So hopefully you have those laying around.
},
{
    46.56,51.68
     Also you can do these pretty much anywhere, at home, at work, anytime that you want.
},
{
    51.68,58.4
     They're just very easy exercises and stretches that are going to give very quick pain relief.
},
{
    58.4,60.44
     So let's get started with them.
},
{
    60.44,66.28
     So with the first part I'm going to go over two exercises that are going to focus on instant
},
{
    66.28,67.48
     neck pain relief.
},
{
    67.48,72.52
     They're going to really target muscle knots, tightness, stiffness, all that stuff that's
},
{
    72.52,75.72
     going on into the neck, possibly even into the shoulders.
},
{
    75.72,77.92
     So I'm going to sit in a chair for this one.
},
{
    77.92,80.56
     Let's get really good upright posture.
},
{
    80.56,86.36
     Let's start off with a base of the skull exercise that's going to take a lot of muscle
},
{
    86.36,87.92
     tightness off of that very quickly.
},
{
    87.92,91.4
     What I'm going to do is I'm going to take two fingers and I'm going to make hooks with
},
{
    91.4,94.72
     them and then I'm going to go right at the base of the skull.
},
{
    94.72,99.44
     If this is pretty tender, just start to massage it by putting a little bit of pressure into
},
{
    99.44,106.14
     those muscles and just going in circular motions for about five seconds, just to help loosen it up.
},
{
    106.14,107.74
     From here, what we're going to do
},
{
    107.74,111.14
     is I'm going to slightly tuck my chin,
},
{
    111.14,114.14
     and then I'm going to then use my head
},
{
    114.14,116.68
     and push back into my fingers
},
{
    116.68,119.28
     while I continue that circular massage.
},
{
    119.28,121.38
     And I tell you what, this can be very tender,
},
{
    121.38,124.12
     so only go towards your comfort level.
},
{
    124.12,129.32
     This is a very good way to just target muscle knots and tightness that builds tension and
},
{
    129.32,132.78
     maybe causes headaches, possibly even migraines.
},
{
    132.78,135.44
     You want to do this for about 10 seconds.
},
{
    135.44,139.76
     You're just going to simply relax, and then you're just going to repeat that process up
},
{
    139.76,142.76
     to three to five times.
},
{
    142.76,146.02
     This next one is one of my favorite neck pain relief
},
{
    146.02,150.68
     exercises because it can target pretty much anywhere into the neck even into
},
{
    150.68,154.52
     the upper part of the shoulders. What we're going to do is we're going to take
},
{
    154.52,158.18
     our fingers and we're going to make a hook with them again and go over a spot
},
{
    158.18,161.22
     that you feel a muscle knot or there's just a lot of tightness and pain that
},
{
    161.22,168.32
     needs to be released. What I do is I just massage that for about five to 10 seconds to loosen the muscle up.
},
{
    168.32,173.0
     Then from there, what we're going to do is turn the head in the opposite direction of
},
{
    173.0,174.0
     the pain.
},
{
    174.0,178.88
     If I have a left-sided spot, I want to take my head and look towards, or I should say
},
{
    178.88,180.76
     over my right shoulder.
},
{
    180.76,183.0
     Continue to apply pressure on this.
},
{
    183.0,187.0
     When you turn or rotate your head, it's going to intensify that massage.
},
{
    187.0,193.0
     Make sure only to go to your comfort level. 10 to 15 seconds for that massage.
},
{
    193.0,202.0
     What you're going to do from there is intensify it even further by then taking the head and then looking down towards the floor.
},
{
    202.0,207.36
     This feels great. What I like to do is apply pressure in a circular motion,
},
{
    207.36,213.6
     10 to 15 seconds, and then what I'm going to do is relax and you can repeat that until you feel that
},
{
    213.6,219.76
     muscle tightness or that muscle knot finally start to go away. And then from there just go over
},
{
    219.76,226.24
     different spots as you need. So I want to go over a very easy postural exercise that works
},
{
    226.24,230.5
     wonders for the neck, upper back, and shoulders. You can pretty much do it
},
{
    230.5,234.86
     anywhere. This one is perfect to do at work. What I'm going to do is go into a
},
{
    234.86,240.3
     good upright posture. Take your fingers, drive the chin back a little bit until it
},
{
    240.3,246.12
     feels like a very good stretch into the neck. Hold this position. This is the second part.
},
{
    246.12,248.08
     We're going to take our arms,
},
{
    248.08,250.62
     and we're going to wean the elbows back like this
},
{
    250.62,252.48
     until it feels like the shoulder blades
},
{
    252.48,254.52
     and the back are starting to pinch.
},
{
    254.52,256.72
     You should have a very good neck stretch,
},
{
    256.72,259.2
     but you should also now have a very good shoulder
},
{
    259.2,261.36
     and in between the shoulder blade stretch.
},
{
    261.36,262.6
     What we're going to do from there
},
{
    262.6,269.12
     is slowly start to raise our arms up like this so we're touching our fingertips. Hold this for a couple
},
{
    269.12,274.2
     seconds, start to come back down and then from there take your chin, drive it back
},
{
    274.2,278.2
     a little bit further and we're going to also try to bring our arms back a little
},
{
    278.2,282.6
     bit further. And then we're just going to keep repeating that process. And you
},
{
    282.6,285.84
     want to do this about five times.
},
{
    285.84,288.76
     Just keep going back as far as you're able to.
},
{
    288.76,291.64
     Nice, slow, controlled movements.
},
{
    291.64,295.5
     What this does is it helps stretch the front, the pec muscles.
},
{
    295.5,299.32
     It's going to hit in between the shoulder blades, the neck right here to loosen everything
},
{
    299.32,304.32
     up while also promoting better posture in our upper backs and neck.
},
{
    304.32,305.94
     It's a wonderful exercise.
},
{
    305.94,306.94
     Give it a try.
},
{
    306.94,311.74
     For this next part, we're going to focus on increasing neck flexibility.
},
{
    311.74,316.44
     One of the easiest ways that you can do that is through using a towel.
},
{
    316.44,320.84
     If you feel like you just have a lot of locked up tightness where you're just not able to
},
{
    320.84,324.96
     move the head from side to side, this one's going to work perfectly.
},
{
    324.96,326.68
     Just use an everyday hand drying towel.
},
{
    326.68,328.18
     Place it on the backside of the neck
},
{
    328.18,330.86
     and go over the level that you feel
},
{
    330.86,334.32
     is really the one that needs the most amount of attention.
},
{
    334.32,337.26
     Grab the two ends right here and pull them forward
},
{
    337.26,339.14
     so they're very, or I should say the towel
},
{
    339.14,341.48
     is very tight against the back of the neck.
},
{
    341.48,343.72
     And then what I'm going to do is whatever side
},
{
    343.72,345.72
     that I'm having difficult turning towards,
},
{
    345.72,350.2
     so like let's say I can't turn towards my left, I'm going to take the end on the opposite
},
{
    350.2,358.12
     side and then I'm going to then start to turn my head with the towel while I hold the other
},
{
    358.12,359.62
     end locked.
},
{
    359.62,366.48
     And what this does is it helps build nice slow rotation in there into a very nice passive stretch that you can
},
{
    366.48,373.84
     control. Also the towel is going to help massage those neck muscles at the same time. I go to a
},
{
    373.84,380.16
     point where I feel comfortable and I'm going to hold that for up to 10 seconds before relaxing
},
{
    380.16,387.88
     and then do that five times. You can continue to do this until you feel like your motion is starting to come back
},
{
    387.88,391.08
     and it's helping to relieve a lot of that neck muscle tightness.
},
{
    391.08,395.0
     Also, when you do this, make sure to do it on the other side.
},
{
    395.0,399.34
     So even if it doesn't hurt, you always want to keep everything balanced.
},
{
    399.34,404.4
     But then you can just lower it or raise it as needed and hit other spots of the neck.
},
{
    404.4,408.36
     Let's say that you're having a lot of pinching sharp pain going on to the neck also.
},
{
    408.36,412.54
     So let's do this same stretch but build a little bit of traction into there.
},
{
    412.54,416.0
     So what I'm going to do is cross my arms like this.
},
{
    416.0,420.16
     And then whatever side that I feel like I need to really just stretch out, I lift that
},
{
    420.16,429.78
     end up towards the ceiling and then I'm going to turn it 45 degrees kind of like almost right towards my eye and I'm going to lift up at that point while
},
{
    429.78,435.48
     the other end stays locked and I tell you what this feels like it just opens the
},
{
    435.48,440.92
     neck up in a nice stretching traction like a pulling motion hold this one for
},
{
    440.92,447.36
     10 seconds relax and then just repeat that one up to five times.
},
{
    447.36,450.72
     With this one, you can really just target certain spots that you feel like you might
},
{
    450.72,453.92
     have something like a pinch near going on in the neck.
},
{
    453.92,456.16
     Traction is wonderful for opening up those.
},
{
    456.16,457.84
     So give that a try.
},
{
    457.84,462.16
     So this next one, we're going to focus on building a lot of mobility into the neck, but also
},
{
    462.16,463.68
     into the upper back.
},
{
    463.68,465.92
     I'm going to be using a broomstick for this.
},
{
    465.92,467.12
     If you don't have a broomstick,
},
{
    467.12,470.64
     you can use anything that pretty much is long and sturdy.
},
{
    470.64,474.32
     PVC pipe, people have used toilet plungers before,
},
{
    474.32,475.56
     if you really want to go that route,
},
{
    475.56,478.0
     go out in the yard, grab a stick, it all works.
},
{
    478.0,480.96
     So what I'm going to do is palm side up,
},
{
    480.96,483.24
     put my elbows onto a flat surface.
},
{
    483.24,486.68
     You can do this on a desk or even on a chair
},
{
    486.68,491.92
     or a bed works perfectly. What I'm going to do from there is take the stick and then
},
{
    491.92,498.8
     bring my arms over my head and try to touch the stick to the back of my neck. What I want
},
{
    498.8,506.54
     to do is build into a thoracic or upper back extension exercise. This is how we're going to do it. With my
},
{
    506.54,511.7
     butt, I'm just going to start to take that to the floor, or I should say towards my
},
{
    511.7,517.64
     heels, and then what you should feel is a very good arch starting to be formed in
},
{
    517.64,523.5
     the upper back. This right here, it just helps open up everything between the
},
{
    523.5,525.86
     shoulder blades all the way to the neck.
},
{
    525.86,527.58
     Should feel like a great stretch.
},
{
    527.58,532.46
     Sometimes you'll get a pop, crack, or self-release into that area, completely normal.
},
{
    532.46,538.9
     You'll want to hold this position for 10 to 15 seconds, relax, and then repeat up to five
},
{
    538.9,539.9
     times.
},
{
    539.9,544.22
     But this is a great exercise that will help build mobility, more flexibility into the
},
{
    544.22,549.28
     upper back and neck that may relieve tightness, stiffness, those type of things that may be
},
{
    549.28,551.36
     causing your neck pain.
},
{
    551.36,552.36
     Give these a try.
},
{
    552.36,553.68
     I really do hope they help.
