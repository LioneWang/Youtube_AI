     So many of my patients who come into the clinic with back pain caused by golf have got a bit of a hip problem and a hip mobility issue.
},
{
    7.0,20.0
     And reason being is when they swing through a ball, instead of moving the hip forwards, they don't move the hip forwards at all, the hip stays still and all that rotation comes from the back, putting a lot of pressure on the lower back.
},
{
    20.0,25.34
     So the first thing we need to do is increase mobility of the hip and there's
},
{
    25.34,29.72
     two exercises I'm going to show you for that. The first one is the Bretzel 2.0
},
{
    29.72,34.64
     and the second one is a pigeon stretch. Really good exercises to increase that
},
{
    34.64,40.12
     mobility. Okay let's get started on the Bretzel 2.0.
},
{
    54.4,61.9
     So this next exercise is called the Bratall 2.0 and what you need to do is sit like this with your upper leg perpendicular to the wall. My lower leg is straight behind me. I've
},
{
    61.9,65.04
     got a 90 degree angle in my knee, a 90 degree angle in both knees.
},
{
    65.04,70.04
     I'm placing both my hands about 30 centimeters in front of me, so about a foot in front of
},
{
    70.04,75.06
     me. The first thing we're doing is turning now my left shoulder backwards. This already
},
{
    75.06,79.72
     gives me a nice stretch in this case in my left hip. Turn that backwards, breathe into
},
{
    79.72,84.84
     the stretch. You make sure you breathe out whilst you're stretching. If this goes well,
},
{
    84.84,86.84
     you can do now straight in your knee.
},
{
    86.84,89.0
     Now do the same thing.
},
{
    89.0,92.08
     Now you're really going to feel that on the outside of your hip.
},
{
    92.08,96.2
     Now straighten your knee and hold this again, breathe out into the stretch.
},
{
    96.2,98.24
     Hold this for about 10 seconds.
},
{
    98.24,103.0
     If this goes well, what you can do is now place my, I'm not going to place my right hand underneath
},
{
    103.0,106.48
     my left hand and I'm going to lean into the
},
{
    106.48,111.08
     stretch, always keep my left elbow straight, lean into the stretch and I lean towards my
},
{
    111.08,112.08
     right.
},
{
    112.08,117.0
     Now that really stretches the hip out and then push my left shoulder back, hold this
},
{
    117.0,122.16
     for again for about 10 seconds and repeat about 5 times.
},
{
    122.16,125.16
     That's called the Bratzel 2.0. Let me demonstrate to you on the other side.
},
{
    125.32,130.14
     So like up here perpendicular to the wall, other leg is straight behind me.
},
{
    131.28,136.92
     My hands are now 30 centimeters in front of me. Yeah, I'm now turning to the right.
},
{
    137.52,141.28
     Yeah, hold this for a little bit. If it goes well, I'm straightening my right leg.
},
{
    141.88,147.52
     Yeah, and sitting in this position here, moving forward a bit
},
{
    147.52,153.6
     and I can really now turn even more or place my left hand under my right hand
},
{
    153.6,159.08
     and fall away to in this case my left side keep my left elbow straight and
},
{
    159.08,167.52
     you can really feel that on that hip now hold this again for about 10 seconds, I repeat 5 to 10 times.
},
{
    167.52,171.92
     Really good exercise to stretch out the hip.
},
{
    171.92,176.84
     So another great exercise to improve the hip mobility for your golf swing is the pigeon
},
{
    176.84,177.84
     pose.
},
{
    177.84,182.52
     And what you need to do is be on going all fours first, then in this case straighten out
},
{
    182.52,186.64
     the right leg, now move the left knee forward, crawl with your foot to the edge to the side eerst. In dit geval, straat je de lucht uit. Nu, move de linker neemt voor.
},
{
    186.64,191.76
     Verder met je voet naar de eeuw, naar de kant van je mat.
},
{
    191.76,196.64
     Dus nu, wat ik doe, is ik werk op de externere rotator op mijn linker hip en werk
},
{
    196.64,208.88
     op de extensie van mijn linker hip. Nu, ik ga mijn arm naar voren. Ik leef over de Now moving the arms forward, I'm leaning over the hip, there we are, and I'm pushing my left hip back a little bit,
},
{
    208.88,217.76
     really trying to extend my right leg at the same time, and hold this stretch for about five to ten seconds,
},
{
    217.76,229.52
     and repeat about five times on each side. Really good stretch as well to get more mobility in the hips. So the first strength exercise I'm going to demonstrate to you to create this
},
{
    229.52,234.04
     rotational core stability for your lower back is probably the best one out there
},
{
    234.04,239.08
     it's called the Palo Brass and what you need is you need an elastic band for
},
{
    239.08,243.8
     this exercise. You make sure you take up the slacks, we have a bit of tension on
},
{
    243.8,251.0
     the band. I've got about 30 centimetres space between my feet. All I'm doing now is I've got the band straight
},
{
    251.0,256.4
     ahead of me and I'm now extending my arms. So what this does is the elastic bands are
},
{
    256.4,261.16
     trying to pull me towards my right, but I have to stabilise myself with my core muscles
},
{
    261.16,266.0
     and make sure I stay in the middle. So I hold this here now for 8 to 10 seconds.
},
{
    266.64,272.56
     Yeah, and then I come back again, do the same thing. And I do eight repetitions to start off with.
},
{
    272.56,278.24
     Then I take a 20 second break, I go to 6, then I take a 20 second break, go to 4 and I do 2.
},
{
    278.24,283.44
     And you obviously need to do both sides. This is called the paloff press. Now this is too easy for
},
{
    283.44,288.34
     you. Either obviously you take a bit more stretch or you use different
},
{
    288.34,289.84
     band with a bit more resistance.
},
{
    289.84,295.52
     Now, the two most common mistakes I see with this one is, one, people do not extend the
},
{
    295.52,297.6
     arms fully, that's number one.
},
{
    297.6,299.8
     Or two, they start off with too much resistance.
},
{
    299.8,302.24
     So they're really struggling to keep everything going.
},
{
    302.24,306.24
     They can't extend the arms and the lower back rotates anyway.
},
{
    306.24,310.8
     This is an absolutely fantastic exercise to stabilize your lower back during those golf
},
{
    310.8,312.96
     strings and decrease your back pain with golf.
},
{
    313.6,319.92
     Now, another great and simple exercise to improve your rotational core stability strength
},
{
    319.92,323.2
     is using a side plank with a tarot band.
},
{
    323.2,325.08
     So what you do is I'm wrapping the terra band
},
{
    325.08,326.62
     around my elbow, this case,
},
{
    326.62,329.44
     I'm holding it in my hands, just shorten it a bit.
},
{
    329.44,331.06
     I'm going to the side plank position,
},
{
    331.06,332.98
     supporting myself on my elbow.
},
{
    333.92,337.08
     Yeah, and all I'm doing now is I'm going up slowly
},
{
    337.08,338.36
     and come down again slowly.
},
{
    338.36,342.96
     And you do about three sets of each 10 to 15 repetitions.
},
{
    342.96,346.2
     Great exercise, do it slow, watch your breathing, make sure
},
{
    346.2,352.2
     you do both sides, very very important and it's a great exercise to increase that lumbar
},
{
    352.2,357.48
     rotational stability and thereby decreasing back pain when you're playing golf.
},
{
    357.48,363.16
     I hope these exercises that have demonstrated to you will help you to improve your golf
},
{
    363.16,369.32
     and to reduce the back pain whilst playing your round. If you found any value in this video don't hesitate and

    369.32,373.84
     just comment on the video or give me a thumbs up or subscribe to my channel. So
},
{
    373.84,377.12
     for now I'd like to say take care of yourself, take care of someone else as
},
{
    377.12,381.36
     well if you can and bye for now. Bye bye.
