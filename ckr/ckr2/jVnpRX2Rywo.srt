     In this video, I'm going to show you how to fix muscle knots in your neck and shoulder in 30 seconds.
},

    5.12,6.12
     Stay tuned.

    11.12,14.48
     Hey everyone, Dr. O here at SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan.
},
{
    14.48,19.6
     So in this video, we're going to deal with those pesky muscle knots or spasms in the neck,
},
{
    19.6,22.6
     trapezius or trap muscles, and across the shoulders.
},
{
    22.6,26.52
     So if you're dealing with a lot of just tight, achy muscle pain,
},
{
    26.52,28.96
     this is a video that you're not going to want to miss.
},
{
    28.96,31.44
     I'm going to break it up into a very simple
},
{
    31.44,34.72
     step-by-step guide that's going to target the upper neck
},
{
    34.72,37.04
     all across the neck, across the shoulders.
},
{
    37.04,38.12
     It's very simple.
},
{
    38.12,40.72
     They're going to be very safe, effective movements.
},
{
    40.72,44.0
     Great part is you can do them anywhere, at work, at home.
},
{
    44.0,48.96
     We're not going to be using any special equipment other than just a racket ball right here.
},
{
    48.96,52.8
     You can also use a tennis ball or a golf ball if you have one laying around the house.
},
{
    52.8,56.32
     If you don't have one, go stop at your local sporting goods department, pick them up.
},
{
    56.32,57.32
     They're really cheap.
},
{
    57.32,59.52
     You can get a three pack for less than five bucks.
},
{
    59.52,63.28
     But we're just going to really go in there, target those muscle knots, and hopefully get
},
{
    63.28,65.76
     you relief in as little as 30 seconds.
},
{
    65.76,66.96
     Let's get started with them.
},
{
    66.96,71.4
     The first exercise that we're going to do for muscle knots in the neck is going to target
},
{
    71.4,75.06
     the upper part of the neck, especially right below the base of the skull.
},
{
    75.06,79.08
     If you're dealing with tension headaches, migraines, those type of things, this is going to be one
},
{
    79.08,81.72
     that probably will help you quite a bit.
},
{
    81.72,85.96
     We're just going to sit in a chair, and we're going to have very nice upright posture.
},
{
    85.96,89.28
     Let's take two fingers and make hooks with them just like this.
},
{
    89.28,94.0
     Let's go over the base of the skull or over the spot that feels very tender.
},
{
    94.0,98.64
     Put a little bit of pressure in there and start to do nice circular motions over those
},
{
    98.64,99.64
     muscles.
},
{
    99.64,104.6
     Make sure only to go over the muscles themselves, not directly over the spine.
},
{
    104.6,107.5
     You just want to do a 10 second massage.
},
{
    107.5,112.6
     From there what I'm going to do is I'm going to tuck my chin towards my chest and then
},
{
    112.6,118.12
     I'm going to press backwards with my head into my fingers and then repeat that self-massage.
},
{
    118.12,125.96
     I tell you what, this right here really intensifies it and makes those muscles really just tight to the point
},
{
    125.96,130.4
     where you can really start to dig into them. Only go to your comfort level. But
},
{
    130.4,134.76
     you want to just do this for about 10 to 15 seconds. You're just going to relax
},
{
    134.76,139.38
     and then you're just going to repeat that up to three to five times. You can work
},
{
    139.38,143.76
     your way down a little bit too and go over different spots as needed. So this
},
{
    143.76,146.8
     next muscle knot fix for the neck is very good
},
{
    146.8,149.84
     to hit general spots over the neck.
},
{
    149.84,151.64
     You can go pretty much all the way from the top,
},
{
    151.64,153.0
     all the way to the bottom,
},
{
    153.0,154.98
     including right here into the shoulder.
},
{
    154.98,157.04
     This is one of my personal favorites.
},
{
    157.04,159.52
     So whatever side that you're having a muscle knot,
},
{
    159.52,161.44
     let's say that I have it right here on my right side,
},
{
    161.44,163.88
     I'm just gonna go directly over that muscle.
},
{
    163.88,168.28
     Again, I'm going to take two fingers, I'm just going to self massage it for about
},
{
    168.28,172.56
     10 seconds, only to your comfort level. This one's going to be a three-part
},
{
    172.56,176.44
     process and I promise you it's very easy. The first part is just massaging it
},
{
    176.44,180.6
     just like this for about 10 to 15 seconds. Then from there we're going to
},
{
    180.6,189.18
     slowly start to look over towards the opposite shoulder. Again, try to put just a little bit more pressure into that muscle spot.
},
{
    189.18,192.86
     This is going to activate those neck muscles, so you're going to be able to, again, just
},
{
    192.86,197.2
     dig right into that muscle spasm, that knot.
},
{
    197.2,199.82
     From there, 10 to 15 seconds.
},
{
    199.82,204.02
     The third part, what we're going to do is look down towards the floor.
},
{
    204.02,208.48
     This right here gets very intense into the neck, so only go to your comfort level with
},
{
    208.48,209.48
     it.
},
{
    209.48,211.48
     Again, 10 to 15 seconds.
},
{
    211.48,215.36
     From there, just give it a little bit of a relaxation period and then just repeat that
},
{
    215.36,219.46
     process of doing it about three to five times.
},
{
    219.46,221.24
     You can then go over different spots.
},
{
    221.24,224.98
     You can switch over to the other side of the neck, but it's just a very good way to hit
},
{
    224.98,227.2
     all the spots in the neck very easily and very
},
{
    227.2,231.16
     quickly. Give that one a try. So here's another easy way to get rid of muscle
},
{
    231.16,235.32
     knots throughout the neck. I'm going to be using my racquetball for this one. So
},
{
    235.32,238.4
     whatever side that I'm having a muscle knot, let's say here right on my right
},
{
    238.4,242.92
     side, I'm going to take the lacrosse ball racquetball, I'm going to cup it in my
},
{
    242.92,247.2
     hand just like this and then I'm going to place it over that muscle knot.
},
{
    247.2,249.18
     Get in very good upright posture.
},
{
    249.18,251.88
     You want your neck in a very neutral position.
},
{
    251.88,258.58
     Then just use your hand to just put circular motions into that muscle spasm or muscle knot.
},
{
    258.58,262.36
     Do this for about 10 to 15 seconds to your comfort level.
},
{
    262.36,265.68
     Once you feel it release a little bit what we can do then is apply
},
{
    265.68,271.04
     pressure and then we're just going to tuck the chin like this and again this is going to feel
},
{
    271.04,275.76
     very very sensitive but you just want to go in there dig at those muscle knots to get them to
},
{
    275.76,280.48
     release and then you're just going to relax for a bit and repeat that three to five times and then
},
{
    280.48,284.96
     just go over different spots that need it. So for this next one we're going to target the lower part
},
{
    284.96,287.0
     of the neck and into the trapezius
},
{
    287.0,289.28
     muscle top of the shoulder right here.
},
{
    289.28,293.16
     If you're unfamiliar with the trapezius muscle it's that big muscle right here on top of
},
{
    293.16,294.16
     the shoulder.
},
{
    294.16,296.04
     It's responsible for lifting them up.
},
{
    296.04,299.2
     It can get affected by forward rounded posture.
},
{
    299.2,304.46
     So think using cell phones, driving computer use, you name it, we're always flexed forward
},
{
    304.46,306.48
     so it can get very tight and achy
},
{
    306.48,309.68
     and be susceptible to muscle knots and spasms.
},
{
    309.68,312.64
     So I'm going to go over a spot that right here,
},
{
    312.64,315.36
     let's say on my right side that just feels very, very tight
},
{
    315.36,316.8
     like there's a big knot in there.
},
{
    316.8,318.88
     I'm just going to use two fingers
},
{
    318.88,320.8
     and just put a little bit of pressure in there
},
{
    320.8,324.12
     and dig and self massage 10 to 15 seconds.
},
{
    324.12,327.4
     The second part of this, what we're going to do is whatever side that you're having
},
{
    327.4,332.72
     that muscle not take that ear towards that shoulder while applying pressure in there
},
{
    332.72,334.08
     in that circular motion.
},
{
    334.08,339.28
     This is going to intensify that exercise just a little bit.
},
{
    339.28,344.88
     So you want to do this again 10 to 15 seconds and then from there slowly take the ear to
},
{
    344.88,346.16
     the opposite shoulder.
},
{
    346.16,350.52
     And I tell you what, this is a really, really good exercise.
},
{
    350.52,355.44
     It's going to isolate that muscle knot into that trapezius right there on the top of the
},
{
    355.44,360.06
     shoulder and allow you to just dig in there and hopefully get rid of those muscle knots
},
{
    360.06,362.62
     maybe again in as little as 30 seconds.
},
{
    362.62,367.88
     So just repeat that three to five times and you can switch to different spots over the shoulder here and then switch
},
{
    367.88,371.88
     to the other side as needed. So if you're dealing with muscle knots across the
},
{
    371.88,375.88
     shoulder maybe in the front top or towards the back right here this is a
},
{
    375.88,379.52
     very easy way to get rid of them. I'm going to be using my lacrosse ball
},
{
    379.52,383.6
     racquetball for this and I'm also going to be using a pillowcase. If you don't
},
{
    383.6,388.4
     have a pillowcase use a large tube sock, a large sock laying around the house. You can also use
},
{
    388.4,393.52
     a trash bag if you don't have any of those. But just place the ball in towards
},
{
    393.52,397.96
     one of the corners right here. That way you have a nice handle on it. I find that
},
{
    397.96,401.36
     this is an easy way to be able to get in there and position it. So this is how
},
{
    401.36,406.12
     we're going to do the exercise. Let's take our ball and then place it over that muscle knot
},
{
    406.12,407.12
     on the back of the shoulder,
},
{
    407.12,409.52
     possibly even in between the shoulder blades.
},
{
    409.52,412.52
     Let's go right up to a door frame,
},
{
    412.52,414.72
     and then we're just going to get into that spot
},
{
    414.72,416.12
     that we feel that muscle knot,
},
{
    416.12,417.82
     and we're going to use our upper body weight
},
{
    417.82,419.92
     to drive backwards into it.
},
{
    419.92,422.06
     And try to do a nice circular massage
},
{
    422.06,425.2
     for about 10 to 15 seconds to your comfort level.
},
{
    425.2,429.96
     This right here should already start to dig at that muscle and hopefully get it to release.
},
{
    429.96,432.56
     But this is how we're going to make it even more intense.
},
{
    432.56,436.34
     Take our arm on whatever side that you have the ball and we're just going to raise it
},
{
    436.34,440.6
     up to shoulder level and then bend the elbow at 90 degrees.
},
{
    440.6,444.66
     Slowly start to reach across the other part of the body so we're reaching over towards
},
{
    444.66,445.4
     the left.
},
{
    445.4,447.5
     This is going to activate those muscles,
},
{
    447.5,450.3
     and it's really going to allow you to dig in there
},
{
    450.3,452.8
     and hopefully release it very quickly.
},
{
    452.8,454.9
     So you want to hold this for about five seconds
},
{
    454.9,458.8
     and then slowly start to come back towards the opposite side.
},
{
    458.8,461.0
     This right here you want to repeat
},
{
    461.0,464.7
     for about five complete repetitions.
},
{
    464.7,465.0
     And then from there, straighten the arm completely and do that same movement, but go vertically. to repeat for about five complete repetitions.
},
{
    465.0,469.8
     And then from there, straighten the arm completely and do that same movement, but go vertically
},
{
    469.8,470.8
     with it.
},
{
    470.8,475.92
     Again, trying to apply pressure in the back and just working those muscle knots out.
},
{
    475.92,480.24
     Very, very slowly, hold each one for about five seconds before coming back and then going
},
{
    480.24,484.92
     down and then repeating the same thing and then doing five repetitions with it.
},
{
    484.92,485.06
     So this is how we're going to fix muscle knots and spas and then doing five repetitions with it.
},
{
    485.06,489.12
     This is how we're going to fix muscle knots and spasms on the front part of the shoulder.
},
{
    489.12,493.94
     Let's take our lacrosse ball, racquet ball, and place it right at a door frame, right
},
{
    493.94,496.16
     over the spot that you're having issues.
},
{
    496.16,498.86
     Take your body weight and just lean into it.
},
{
    498.86,503.32
     Just do a simple self-circular massage to get everything loosened up.
},
{
    503.32,509.0
     You can kind of see how I'm just rotating my arm like this. 10 to 15 seconds and then once it does finally
},
{
    509.0,513.2
     start to release this is going to be the next part. Let's raise our arm up to
},
{
    513.2,517.56
     shoulder height and then if you need to you can kind of just lower your body into
},
{
    517.56,522.52
     a scissor stance right here to make sure that you have a good positioning. What
},
{
    522.52,525.14
     I'm going to do is apply pressure and then I'm going to
},
{
    525.14,530.24
     reach forward with the arm. Hold this for about 5 to 10 seconds and then you're just
},
{
    530.24,534.56
     going to come back and bring the elbow back. You're really going to feel those muscles
},
{
    534.56,539.28
     into the shoulder, especially right in the front, start to fire. But this is just a very
},
{
    539.28,543.84
     good way to target those muscle knots and hopefully get them to release. And you just
},
{
    543.84,548.56
     want to do nice slow controlled movements for five repetitions.
},
{
    548.56,553.16
     Then you can just reposition the ball to hit other spots and then switch to the other side
},
{
    553.16,554.16
     as needed.
