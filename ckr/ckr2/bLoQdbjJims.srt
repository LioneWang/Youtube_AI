     Hi everyone! Today I would like to talk about SI joint rehabilitation. I'm gonna
},
{
    8.82,13.84
     cover son and symptoms of this condition, how can be diagnosed and also how
},
{
    13.84,19.12
     can be managed in early and late stages. If you've never been in our channel, my

{
    19.12,23.0
     name is Bob, I'm a physical therapist and I help people with a simple tips and
},
{
    23.0,26.64
     exercises to recover and get back to their routine.

     Let's get started!
},
{
    38.48,43.28
     Sacraliac joint is where our spine articulates with our hip bone.
},
{
    43.28,45.56
     It's a synovial joint but it has a limited
},
{
    45.56,51.4
     range of movements between 3 to 5 degrees. As we age this range of movements
},
{
    51.4,56.8
     actually reduce due to the aging process. The relationship between Sij and
},
{
    56.8,63.28
     back pain has been a subject of debate for many studies that they believe that
},
{
    63.28,66.24
     Sij is a major contributor in back pain.
},
{
    66.24,72.8
     In contrast, some of the study has been shown that Sij does not have any
},
{
    72.8,78.4
     contribution in back pain. The silent symptoms of sacroiliac joint can be
},
{
    78.4,87.72
     divided in a couple of categories. Usually patients can complain of back pain, it could be groin, hip, glutes or even referral
},
{
    87.72,90.44
     pain down to your legs.
},
{
    90.44,93.8
     Diagnosis of sacroiliac joint can be pretty challenging.
},
{
    93.8,99.68
     Due to the lack of sensitivity and reliability of diagnostic tests that we have at the moment,
},
{
    99.68,105.4
     study has shown that this test cannot be used for diagnosis of sacroiliac joints. I've
},
{
    105.4,109.72
     shared with you a link below that you can read more about the options that you
},
{
    109.72,114.64
     have for diagnosis. The reason that I share with you this information that you
},
{
    114.64,120.24
     may need to go and visit your physical therapist for a correct diagnosis before
},
{
    120.24,126.08
     you try in this routine. The earliest stage of sacrilege joint management
},
{
    126.08,128.26
     can be similar to other condition,
},
{
    128.26,130.92
     first with minimizing any activity
},
{
    130.92,132.76
     that does aggregate your pain,
},
{
    132.76,137.24
     such as running, in some cases, standing in one leg,
},
{
    137.24,140.28
     and also following police and no harm protocol
},
{
    140.28,143.04
     that we have available in our website.
},
{
    143.04,145.64
     I've added those link in this video that
},
{
    145.64,149.64
     you can get access to them and I would suggest to read them. In the meantime,
},
{
    149.64,153.32
     when you're following those two protocols, you're going to follow an
},
{
    153.32,157.96
     exercise rehabilitation routine that I'm going to show you right now. Let's go to
},
{
    157.96,163.72
     the exercise number one and you can start this routine right away. I'm going to
},
{
    163.72,165.48
     start this routine with MIT which stands for muscle energy away. I'm going to start this routine with MIT which
},
{
    165.48,169.92
     stands for muscle energy technique. I'm going to show you this exercise and it
},
{
    169.92,176.88
     can give it a try. You're gonna lie down on your back and we'll try to do this
},
{
    176.88,181.32
     exercise for both sides. And we're gonna start with the right side which we believe
},
{
    181.32,187.0
     let's say if is your pain side of your SIG. We're gonna apply
},
{
    187.0,193.0
     actually 20 to 30% of our maximum strength to this thigh and this thigh
},
{
    193.0,199.84
     move towards your body. And the opposite leg, I'm pushing down my heel to the
},
{
    199.84,205.44
     ground, which means both work at the same time. I'm going to lie down on my back, I'm pushing
},
{
    205.44,214.92
     back with this leg, holding it there for five seconds, four, three, two. In the meantime,
},
{
    214.92,233.32
     this push down and relax. I'm going to do one more round, same thing. push down here and push back five four three two one I'm gonna
},
{
    233.32,248.16
     switch legs same story I'm pushing back with this leg and pushing down with the opposite leg. 5, 4, 3, 2 and relax.
},
{
    250.08,266.92
     You can do one more round. 5, 4, 3, 2 and relax. You can practice this for a couple of rounds, three to four sets in both sides.
},
{
    266.92,272.16
     There is no harm to try this for both sides and this can help you to balance
},
{
    272.16,276.32
     this muscle strength in both sides. Give it a try and we're going to move on to
},
{
    276.32,280.92
     the second move. The following move is going to be squat and I'm going to show
},
{
    280.92,290.6
     you how squat can help you improve your symptoms. You may need to use some of these yoga blocks that I have here, or even you can use some
},
{
    290.6,292.84
     even-sized book.
},
{
    292.84,295.4
     As you can see, either of them can be used.
},
{
    295.4,299.0
     I'm going to show you a book which would be more practical.
},
{
    299.0,304.76
     You're going to try to do squat in a little bit like progressive way, which you start
},
{
    304.76,305.04
     with the
},
{
    305.04,311.28
     range that you have. I'm gonna show you the how you're gonna use the books and
},
{
    311.28,318.78
     put them shoulder part, speed from each other and you try to see if you can get
},
{
    318.78,323.2
     your range all the way down. Now for me because I've been practicing this movement
},
{
    323.2,329.14
     it's for me it's very easy to actually get to that squat position and stay there. Now I use
},
{
    329.14,333.84
     this exercise as a stretch that you can actually ease off your lower back
},
{
    333.84,339.62
     pressure massively and also it does stretch your hip and your glutes. Now I
},
{
    339.62,345.4
     try to shift my body to the right and left, but if you never ever try this
},
{
    345.4,351.96
     exercise to this depth, what you may need to use some assistance. You can use
},
{
    351.96,357.52
     anywhere that you have access, I would say probably this way would be better. I
},
{
    357.52,369.6
     use that as an example, that you can use your hands here and engage your balance. You can stay there 10 to 15 seconds. Now
},
{
    369.6,373.1
     what you're trying to do while you're going to that depth, you're trying to
},
{
    373.1,374.36
     breathe in and out.
},
{
    374.36,379.92
     And if you can
},
{
    379.92,384.56
     stay there or even hold your hands there as long as you feel comfortable, that's the
},
{
    384.56,389.42
     main thing. Some cases you may need something a little bit ticker you can
},
{
    389.42,394.96
     use two books I show you different very variety that you can use two books and
},
{
    394.96,400.52
     that gives you more kind of range that to get to that depth we aiming to say
},
{
    400.52,407.04
     there 10 to 15 seconds you practice this for a couple of times, breathing in and out.
},
{
    407.6,414.56
     You're trying to relax that pressure off your lower back and your glutes and try to do these
},
{
    415.44,423.44
     through the day a couple of times. Now how many times is good? There's no such thing exist. If
},
{
    423.44,425.2
     you can do this this couple of times and
},
{
    425.2,429.68
     if you get a good relief I would suggest to do them more. Let's give it a try.
},
{
    431.2,435.44
     The next move that I'm going to show you, we're going to strengthen our growing muscle, our
},
{
    435.44,440.8
     adductor. Now how are we going to do that? We need something pretty solid like a ball,
},
{
    440.8,445.16
     basketball or something similar, medicine ball would be good too.
},
{
    445.16,450.26
     I'm going to show you how to use this and strengthen your adopters. Now you're
},
{
    450.26,456.76
     going to basically adjust this between your two ties and you're trying to relax
},
{
    456.76,466.72
     your back and while you're there you're trying to apply 20 to 30% of your maximum strength and squeeze the ball. Hold it there for five seconds
},
{
    468.8,475.84
     four three two and relax. You're going to practice this again.
},
{
    485.0,488.84
     five, four, three, two, and relax.
},
{
    492.16,493.4
     You might even sometimes hear popping noise, which is pretty normal,
},
{
    493.4,495.94
     and that could basically pop your SI joint.
},
{
    495.94,497.76
     Now, I'm gonna show you from this way,
},
{
    497.76,500.08
     that you can see how I conduct this.
},
{
    501.04,512.0
     Gonna squeeze this for five, four, three, two, and relax.
},
{
    512.0,517.0
     Try to maintain that pressure within that five seconds consistently.
},
{
    517.0,521.76
     And you can see a great challenge actually you abductors take all of this exercise.
},
{
    521.76,526.56
     You can try this for three sets of let's say eight repetition and hold it for five
},
{
    526.56,532.0
     seconds. For the following move guys I'm going to use a belt that I have available at home.
},
{
    532.56,538.24
     You may have something similar, a little bit bigger, that should be fine. Now how are we going
},
{
    538.24,550.42
     to do this routine? You're going to use this belt as a resistant around your knees and that give you actually that resistant that we need and we try to push our knees out while we're holding it
},
{
    550.42,555.7
     there for five seconds. Now I'm gonna lie down on my back and you're gonna push
},
{
    555.7,566.3
     your knees both out hold it there for five seconds three two one one, and relax. And we're gonna go one more round.
},
{
    567.4,572.4
     Five, four, three, two, and relax.
},
{
    574.2,575.8
     I'm gonna show you from this side.
},
{
    581.0,583.64
     Gonna push this out, hold it there.
},
{
    583.64,590.36
     Five, four, three, two and relax.
},
{
    590.36,596.48
     You can practice this exercise for three sets of eight and hold it there for five seconds,
},
{
    596.48,597.8
     similar to the previous routine.
},
{
    597.8,603.44
     We're going to finish this routine with two exercises for glute strengthening.
},
{
    603.44,606.16
     Study has shown that strengthening your glutes can help
},
{
    606.16,612.08
     with SIJ dysfunction or pain. I'm going to show you this routine and you can give it a try.
},
{
    612.08,618.16
     You're going to start with glute kickbacks which basically you're on quadruped position,
},
{
    619.04,623.12
     your hands are under your shoulder, your knees under your hip and you're trying to
},
{
    626.88,632.84
     shoulder, your knees under your hip and you're trying to perform that kickback position. Now as you can see I try to engage my core while I'm doing this
},
{
    632.84,640.36
     exercise and try to create extension with one single leg. Now this glutes is
},
{
    640.36,656.68
     the glutes actually that works but in the meantime my core is engaged and I try to minimize any shaking of my body. I try this for three sets of ten
},
{
    656.68,691.0
     initially and whenever I felt comfortable I can progress them to 12. I'll try the same thing with the other leg. I had a 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10.
},
{
    691.0,696.8
     It's a very simple exercise but you can generally feel your glutes actually working.
},
{
    696.8,699.12
     How can we progress this move?
},
{
    699.12,707.96
     You can progress this move with basically glute bridges. Now the normal glute bridges in some cases can be
},
{
    707.96,716.08
     very easy for you which means you could easily do that movement. Trying to go all
},
{
    716.08,722.16
     the way up, hold it there for one seconds, engage the glutes, hold it there for one
},
{
    722.16,728.02
     seconds, slow down. If you find this exercise is easy and it
},
{
    728.02,732.9
     doesn't challenge you, you can try the same thing with a single leg which means
},
{
    732.9,762.74
     you're gonna use your arms for your balance and try to use only one leg. slow down, four and five. You can change legs, one, two, three, four and five.
},
{
    762.74,767.8
     Depends on your own level. Make a decision and see if you prefer to do the
},
{
    767.8,772.72
     normal glute breaches. You can try them for three sets of 10 to 12 and progress them in
},
{
    772.72,778.12
     time to 15. For the single leg glute breaches I would suggest to start them with three sets
},
{
    778.12,785.64
     of 5 to 8 and slowly build them up to 10. I hope you guys find this video helpful.
