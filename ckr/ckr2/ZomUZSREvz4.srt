     In our opinion, of course, Bob.
},
{
    17.36,19.2
     You are wrong.

     It'll be pinned to the top of the page.
},
{
    52.36,55.8
     Want a short version of us, go to Instagram or Twitter.
},
{
    55.8,58.44
     We got 60 second versions of our show.
},
{
    58.44,61.72
     All right, Brad, our right is pain.
},
{
    61.72,65.92
     Now it not only comes from the joint itself, the shoulder,
},
{
    65.92,68.68
     but it also comes from the tissues surrounding the joint,
},
{
    68.68,70.48
     especially the ligaments and the tendons,
},
{
    70.48,72.84
     and you can maybe get a little impingement.
},
{
    72.84,74.92
     Right, the capsule can tighten up,
},
{
    74.92,77.68
     and all those things add up to pain.
},
{
    77.68,80.2
     Right, so it sometimes may not even be your joint
},
{
    80.2,81.2
     that's painful.
},
{
    81.2,82.04
     It's possible.
},
{
    82.04,83.96
     So if your shoulder is tight,
},
{
    83.96,86.8
     pain can often be reduced by regaining the motion.
},
{
    86.8,88.0
     And that's what we're gonna do here.
},
{
    88.0,90.32
     We're gonna show you how to regain your motion.
},
{
    90.32,94.4
     So the number one exercise that we think helps
},
{
    94.4,97.88
     is the Statue of Liberty exercise.
},
{
    97.88,98.72
     Wow.
},
{
    98.72,99.56
     You called it that.
},
{
    99.56,100.4
     Well, I invented it.
},
{
    100.4,101.24
     Yeah, you invented it.
},
{
    101.24,102.08
     I don't know if I invented it,
},
{
    102.08,102.92
     but I had never seen it before
},
{
    102.92,104.64
     and I was working with a patient.
},
{
    104.64,105.84
     We're gonna say you invented it.
},
{
    105.84,107.68
     Yeah, and actually it fits.
},
{
    107.68,110.08
     It's obvious why it's called that.
},
{
    110.08,112.16
     So you're gonna need a bouillistic
},
{
    112.16,115.52
     or you're gonna need some type of pole or broom handle.
},
{
    115.52,118.76
     Right, about five foot long.
},
{
    118.76,120.44
     The bigger the diameter, better.
},
{
    120.44,122.6
     An inch and diameter, inch and a quarter
},
{
    122.6,124.84
     really is easy to grab onto.
},
{
    124.84,127.12
     Yeah, and it's nice to have tips on it.
},
{
    127.12,128.52
     You don't necessarily have to,
},
{
    128.52,131.12
     but you'll see why it does help.
},
{
    131.12,133.84
     We are, you know, put a little plug in for ourselves here.
},
{
    133.84,136.52
     We're gonna sell the Buya Stick on our website
},
{
    136.52,140.08
     for 15% off plus free shipping.
},
{
    140.08,141.72
     So we'll put a link below.
},
{
    141.72,142.8
     It's the red one here.
},
{
    142.8,143.64
     All right.
},
{
    143.64,145.68
     So, all right, so let's start off with the first one, Brad.
},
{
    145.68,147.76
     Do you wanna do it in the chair or where do you wanna do it?
},
{
    147.76,149.84
     Well, yeah, let's do it in the chair.
},
{
    149.84,150.8
     And I'll do it standing.
},
{
    150.8,151.84
     Yep.
},
{
    151.84,154.0
     What are we gonna start?
},
{
    154.0,156.32
     Progressive, it's gonna be the progressive
},
{
    156.32,157.76
     statue of Liberty.
},
{
    157.76,160.16
     We're moving on here, progressive.
},
{
    160.16,161.76
     Right, so if you're sitting in the chair,
},
{
    161.76,164.44
     make sure you got a firm chair is better
},
{
    164.44,166.16
     and sit up to the edge
},
{
    166.16,169.28
     with good pastures as best pastures you can get.
},
{
    169.28,170.32
     And standing as well.
},
{
    170.32,172.76
     Standing as well, you can go up to a countertop or something,
},
{
    172.76,175.68
     or you can go up to a chair, depending on your height.
},
{
    175.68,178.2
     So you're gonna start off, do you want me to start off, Brad?
},
{
    178.2,180.32
     Yeah, and that's why it's beneficial
},
{
    180.32,184.0
     to have a rubber, a tip, or something
},
{
    184.0,185.32
     so it doesn't slip inside.
},
{
    185.32,187.92
     Yeah, and again, as a plug for our Booyah stick,
},
{
    187.92,190.68
     for whatever reason, the material we're using,
},
{
    190.68,194.28
     it's not PVC pipe, really, it's furniture grade,
},
{
    194.28,196.52
     and it's really, it grips.
},
{
    196.52,197.8
     It grips really well.
},
{
    197.8,200.56
     Yeah, it really, it just works out nice.
},
{
    200.56,201.4
     It just works out nice.
},
{
    201.4,202.54
     It works well.
},
{
    202.54,205.9
     So, with progressive, what we're gonna talk about is
},
{
    205.9,208.72
     your shoulder maybe only goes this high.
},
{
    208.72,210.34
     I just had a lady, Brad,
},
{
    210.34,213.14
     that she was initially starting off 85 degrees.
},
{
    213.14,214.06
     You know where that is.
},
{
    214.06,214.9
     Yep.
},
{
    214.9,217.38
     And by the time she was done doing these exercises,
},
{
    217.38,219.1
     she was at 140.
},
{
    219.1,220.94
     You made it one session?
},
{
    220.94,221.9
     No, not one session.
},
{
    221.9,222.98
     But it was, what was it?
},
{
    222.98,225.76
     Mike, Mike worked with her a couple weeks?
},
{
    225.76,226.68
     Couple weeks.
},
{
    226.68,227.52
     Which is good.
},
{
    227.52,228.36
     Yeah, which is good.
},
{
    228.36,231.16
     Yeah, you can't expect miracles.
},
{
    231.16,235.88
     So, all right, so we're gonna give it whatever it takes,
},
{
    235.88,237.56
     whatever it gives you, we're gonna take it.
},
{
    237.56,238.4
     Right.
},
{
    238.4,241.36
     So, if we go this far, we're gonna start leaning forward
},
{
    241.36,244.2
     like this and putting pressure on the shoulder,
},
{
    244.2,245.58
     a nice little stretch.
},
{
    246.76,248.52
     So it's just gonna be an oscillation.
},
{
    248.52,251.48
     It's like pressure on, pressure off.
},
{
    251.48,253.84
     And you can do some end-rains stretches too.
},
{
    253.84,254.68
     Sure, yeah.
},
{
    254.68,256.24
     Now look, I'm keeping my back straight,
},
{
    256.24,258.76
     but that's why the chair sometimes works better for this,
},
{
    258.76,261.3
     because Brad's got his back nice and straight
},
{
    261.3,262.44
     while I was doing this.
},
{
    262.44,265.66
     And if you find that you have to lean too far forward
},
{
    265.66,267.1
     to get the stretch, that's good news,
},
{
    267.1,268.8
     but then just lift your hand up.
},
{
    268.8,270.12
     Yep, start moving your way up.
},
{
    270.12,271.36
     And then you don't have to lean so far.
},
{
    271.36,274.56
     Hence the name progressive, Statue of Liberty.
},
{
    274.56,277.48
     And it's not clear yet why it's called
},
{
    277.48,280.68
     Statue of Liberty, but it will be.
},
{
    280.68,282.4
     Yep, as we work our way up.
},
{
    282.4,283.88
     Yes.
},
{
    283.88,285.16
     We continue to do this.
},
{
    285.16,289.52
     And you may work this for, you know, 10, 15 repetitions.
},
{
    289.52,291.62
     If it continues to feel better, you can go more.
},
{
    291.62,293.0
     But the first time you do it,
},
{
    293.0,295.32
     I wouldn't do it more than 10 or 15
},
{
    295.32,297.72
     because it might not feel too bad while you do it,
},
{
    297.72,299.12
     but because of the stretching
},
{
    299.12,300.8
     that it hasn't experienced for a while,
},
{
    300.8,302.16
     it might get real sore the next day.
},
{
    302.16,304.56
     Now this is not a no pain, no gain situation.
},
{
    304.56,307.44
     We want this to be a painless basic.
},
{
    307.44,309.88
     I mean, you could have a little bit of a bump
},
{
    309.88,311.6
     into the pain, but not pain.
},
{
    311.6,314.16
     So yeah, then when you get up to all the way to the top,
},
{
    314.16,316.0
     now you're starting to look like the Statue of Liberty
},
{
    316.0,318.2
     holding the torch, and you're gonna go ahead
},
{
    318.2,320.28
     and lean forward and you can really get a stretch
},
{
    320.28,321.48
     on there now.
},
{
    321.48,324.16
     And this is where the money is made.
},
{
    324.16,326.44
     This is where the gains are made.
},
{
    326.44,328.84
     And if you're doing this in a chair,
},
{
    328.84,330.36
     and like I'm on the floor,
},
{
    330.36,331.72
     but it's not high enough anymore.
},
{
    331.72,333.44
     So I'm gonna actually bring the stick up
},
{
    333.44,336.4
     onto the chair seat pan itself.
},
{
    336.4,338.6
     I'm gonna get my reach up there.
},
{
    338.6,342.64
     And then right now I'm really getting an aggressive stretch.
},
{
    342.64,345.48
     And again, you're not gonna make it sharp pain
},
{
    345.48,347.28
     or anything, it should be, by this time,
},
{
    347.28,348.96
     after doing it for a few days,
},
{
    348.96,351.24
     it's just gonna be a gentle stretch
},
{
    351.24,354.28
     and feel like a stretch, but not aggravating it.
},
{
    354.28,356.32
     You're getting your reach on, Brad, right?
},
{
    356.32,358.28
     Like getting your freak on.
},
{
    358.28,359.36
     Is that okay to say, Mike?
},
{
    359.36,360.4
     I don't know.
},
{
    360.4,361.24
     All right.
},
{
    361.24,362.08
     Why, Bob?
},
{
    362.08,362.92
     Why?
},
{
    362.92,364.12
     All right, let's go to the next one.
},
{
    364.12,365.28
     Shoulder extensions. So let's say it's, right, let's go to the next one. Shoulder extensions.
},
{
    365.28,367.56
     So let's say it's, you know, you've been doing that one.
},
{
    367.56,369.92
     Now you can do all of these,
},
{
    369.92,372.16
     or you can pick out the ones that work for you.
},
{
    372.16,374.42
     Cause some of these may be a little more difficult.
},
{
    374.42,376.88
     So I like Mike's little suggestion.
},
{
    376.88,378.28
     He said it's like rowing a boat.
},
{
    378.28,379.12
     Oh, sure.
},
{
    379.12,380.52
     So you have the palm down,
},
{
    380.52,383.12
     and this palm up or to the side,
},
{
    383.12,384.86
     I know, outward basically.
},
{
    384.86,387.06
     And you're gonna go back like this
},
{
    387.06,389.68
     and you're stretching back into extension.
},
{
    389.68,391.72
     As far again as pain will allow.
},
{
    391.72,393.48
     Just, you know, if pain hurts right there,
},
{
    393.48,395.96
     stop right there and bring it back again.
},
{
    395.96,396.8
     So.
},
{
    396.8,397.64
     Looking from the back view,
},
{
    397.64,399.24
     he's not going out to the side,
},
{
    399.24,402.76
     but it's behind you if you can do that.
},
{
    402.76,404.96
     So here and if it hurts there,
},
{
    404.96,407.6
     but it's better out to the side, that's okay.
},
{
    407.6,409.2
     Actually, it would probably be good
},
{
    409.2,411.88
     because eventually you will get it to go straight back
},
{
    411.88,413.24
     with more stretching.
},
{
    413.24,416.2
     You can do this one in a chair too, if standing.
},
{
    416.2,420.16
     If you're balanced, maybe need some work,
},
{
    420.16,421.36
     you can do it in a chair.
},
{
    421.36,423.2
     And it's really kind of like rolling.
},
{
    423.2,425.72
     I suppose you could do it in a canoe too. I mean.
},
{
    425.72,426.56
     Well yeah.
},
{
    426.56,429.04
     But then you work some trunk and core
},
{
    429.04,430.72
     and have some outdoor activity.
},
{
    430.72,432.12
     Now we had some discussion on this.
},
{
    432.12,435.16
     You can actually put the stick behind you like this
},
{
    435.16,437.8
     and dip down a little bit and stretch it that way too
},
{
    437.8,439.28
     if that's what you prefer.
},
{
    439.28,440.96
     It's just a different way of going at it.
},
{
    440.96,441.8
     Right, yep.
},
{
    441.8,444.32
     So shoulder internal rotation.
},
{
    444.32,446.08
     Do you want to show that with the belt, Brad?
},
{
    446.08,447.4
     Oh, sure.
},
{
    447.4,451.24
     This one is one that I have found some people just can't do.
},
{
    451.24,453.64
     It's a very good one to do,
},
{
    453.64,456.56
     but some people have trouble getting into this position
},
{
    456.56,459.2
     because they can't get their arm much further than this.
},
{
    459.2,462.76
     So you bring the arm around like this,
},
{
    462.76,463.88
     and you gotta find it,
},
{
    463.88,466.96
     and then you're gonna just start working your way up like that.
},
{
    466.96,468.6
     If you've got severe arthritis,
},
{
    468.6,470.28
     this is gonna be very challenging.
},
{
    470.28,471.48
     It depends on the level.
},
{
    471.48,473.84
     You may have to work the Statue of Liberty
},
{
    473.84,476.08
     and the other extension.
},
{
    476.08,478.48
     Then work, you know, after a couple weeks.
},
{
    478.48,480.92
     This may be the last one.
},
{
    480.92,482.4
     You can do this with a belt too.
},
{
    482.4,483.76
     Brad's gonna demonstrate.
},
{
    483.76,485.56
     Works best with a leather belt,
},
{
    485.56,487.56
     something that's shiny and smooth,
},
{
    487.56,489.98
     and you hook on there and you get a loop.
},
{
    491.08,493.76
     Put that on your wrist,
},
{
    493.76,495.56
     and then this does-
},
{
    495.56,497.08
     Take a little bit of coordination.
},
{
    497.08,499.04
     If there's someone to help you
},
{
    499.04,500.72
     to get it over your shoulder,
},
{
    500.72,502.36
     and then you're just gonna relax
},
{
    502.36,504.52
     the arm that's being stretched right here,
},
{
    504.52,507.84
     and simply it's gonna go over your shoulder
},
{
    507.84,511.24
     like a pulley system and then you just go up and down.
},
{
    511.24,512.96
     That's why you have a shiny belt.
},
{
    512.96,514.46
     It goes so much nicer.
},
{
    515.6,517.24
     And you work just like that.
},
{
    517.24,518.84
     Stretch and down.
},
{
    518.84,521.0
     The next one is kind of a progression from that.
},
{
    521.0,522.56
     This is the one I invented.
},
{
    522.56,523.4
     Oh yes.
},
{
    523.4,525.6
     But Brad came up with the name called Chicken Wing
},
{
    525.6,527.42
     from his wrestling days.
},
{
    527.42,530.52
     So again, one that's gonna be difficult for a lot of you to do.
},
{
    530.52,532.86
     This is great for impingement if you have it.
},
{
    534.68,536.8
     But even shoulder arthritis, if you can get there,
},
{
    536.8,538.08
     it's gonna help.
},
{
    538.08,540.88
     So you're gonna start off like the internal rotation one.
},
{
    540.88,545.36
     So the palm is out and this palm is forward.
},
{
    545.36,547.84
     So this is the shoulder being stretched.
},
{
    547.84,549.56
     This is the shoulder being stretched.
},
{
    549.56,551.16
     I'm not gonna run into my head here,
},
{
    551.16,553.4
     so I wanna go a little bit off to the side.
},
{
    553.4,556.64
     So I bring it up and then I'm actually gonna
},
{
    556.64,560.28
     lever it out like this.
},
{
    560.28,564.68
     This is one, probably more for younger people.
},
{
    564.68,568.0
     But if you're older and you're able to do it
},
{
    568.0,570.36
     and you're not gonna crank on it hard,
},
{
    570.36,573.32
     you're not gonna create sharp pain, it's a stretch.
},
{
    573.32,575.36
     Needless to say, you wouldn't do any of these
},
{
    575.36,576.76
     with a shoulder replacement.
},
{
    576.76,577.6
     Oh, good eye.
},
{
    577.6,578.72
     That's a good point, Bob.
},
{
    578.72,579.56
     Very good point.
},
{
    579.56,581.94
     These are for arthritis or, like I said,
},
{
    581.94,584.28
     this is a great one for impingement.
},
{
    584.28,586.86
     So again, pressure on, pressure off.
},
{
    586.86,588.48
     Always pain be your guide.
},
{
    588.48,592.98
     Never, never allow pain to creep in there too hard.
},
{
    592.98,596.34
     Okay, the last one is abduction.
},
{
    596.34,599.22
     This is kind of probably,
},
{
    599.22,601.54
     I'd say the least needed to do.
},
{
    601.54,602.38
     Yeah, probably.
},
{
    602.38,603.74
     Because it's least functional.
},
{
    603.74,605.42
     Yeah, if you do the other ones,
},
{
    605.42,607.2
     this one's probably gonna come around.
},
{
    607.2,609.72
     So we got palm down on this side,
},
{
    609.72,612.84
     palm up or out on this side,
},
{
    612.84,615.36
     and you're just gonna work going out to the side here.
},
{
    615.36,617.72
     Going up to the side and,
},
{
    617.72,620.76
     I don't know, is this like any motion like the rowing?
},
{
    620.76,623.2
     That's not, there's nothing.
},
{
    623.2,624.84
     Shovel, oh, there, Mike says.
},
{
    624.84,626.0
     Yeah, like you're shoveling.
},
{
    626.0,626.84
     Look at this.
},
{
    626.84,628.56
     This is a shoulder that we're being scratched.
},
{
    628.56,630.28
     We're working on, yeah.
},
{
    630.28,631.68
     So yeah.
},
{
    631.68,635.24
     Throwing the snow, which we will be doing soon, won't we Brad?
},
{
    635.24,637.0
     They're talking like this weekend, maybe.
},
{
    637.0,637.84
     Oh gosh.
},
{
    638.84,640.0
     That's just not fair.
},
{
    642.16,644.56
     All right, so there they are.
},
{
    644.56,645.92
     You know, give them a shot.
},
{
    645.92,647.2
     Don't need to do all of them.
},
{
    647.2,648.8
     Do the, you know, I would definitely start
},
{
    648.8,649.88
     with the Statue of Liberty.
},
{
    649.88,653.12
     That's what I maybe have everybody do.
},
{
    653.12,655.64
     And then you can see which other ones work for you.
},
{
    655.64,658.22
     Right, and once again, the Booyah stick
},
{
    658.22,659.8
     is going to be on special.
},
{
    659.8,661.56
     Yeah, yeah, 15% off.
},
{
    661.56,663.52
     You know, this is the time to grab one.
},
{
    663.52,664.68
     Yeah.
},
{
    664.68,666.04
     Christmas coming up, I'm sure. But you gotta go to Bob and Brad website. Bob and Brad website, 15% off. This is the time to grab one. Christmas is coming up, I'm sure.
},
{
    666.04,667.76
     But you gotta go to Bob and Brad website.
},
{
    667.76,670.32
     Bob and Brad website, that's right.
},
{
    670.32,671.92
     All right, Brad.
},
{
    671.92,None
     Oh yeah. Oh yeah. you
},
