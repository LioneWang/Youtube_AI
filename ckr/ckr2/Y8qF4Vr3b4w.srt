     A key part of staying healthy is being proactive.
},
{
    4.0,7.74
     And that includes regular checkups with your entire healthcare team.
},
{
    7.74,12.24
     So today Jackie is getting an up close look at why that should include regular skin checks.
},
{
    12.24,17.72
     Hey guys, it's Jackie and I'm here today with Dr. Hallmeyer and we are talking a bit about
},
{
    17.72,18.96
     skin checks.
},
{
    18.96,23.0
     And I think a good place to start, doctor, is by discussing just why it's so important
},
{
    23.0,24.0
     to get a skin check.
},
{
    24.0,28.4
     Yeah, that's a great question, right? So skin cancer is the most common human malignancy.
},
{
    28.4,33.36
     The bottom line is that many skin cancers are very highly curable, especially if detected early.
},
{
    33.36,38.32
     Finding a skin cancer at its earliest stage makes most of these malignancies treatable
},
{
    38.32,43.12
     and curable with just a simple surgical excision. Not only is it important to come in for skin checks,
},
{
    43.12,45.0
     but also to be checking your skin at home
},
{
    45.0,46.0
     in advance of those appointments.
},
{
    46.0,48.0
     We rely heavily on our patient population
},
{
    48.0,50.0
     on helping us identify problems.
},
{
    50.0,53.0
     Being aware of your skin, understanding the molds that you have,
},
{
    53.0,55.0
     understanding if anything is changing over time
},
{
    55.0,58.0
     is usually important in getting to medical attention
},
{
    58.0,60.0
     if something is changing at the time when it's changing
},
{
    60.0,62.0
     so we can diagnose the problem very early.
},
{
    62.0,67.08
     And what would cause you to take a second closer look at something on someone's skin? The rule
},
{
    67.08,71.0
     that we're applying has a nice acronym it's called the ABCDE rule. A stands for
},
{
    71.0,76.24
     asymmetry, B stands for the border characteristics, C for color variation, D
},
{
    76.24,80.04
     for the diameter or the size of the lesion, and E the really the most
},
{
    80.04,84.28
     important one is evolution. Change over time is the lesion becoming larger, are
},
{
    84.28,86.26
     the borders becoming more jagged.
},
{
    86.26,88.46
     So you're going to do a quick skin check on me.
},
{
    88.46,89.78
     Should we head over to the chair?
},
{
    89.78,90.78
     Absolutely, sure.
},
{
    90.78,96.5
     In a usual exam, you would check the entire body.
},
{
    96.5,99.26
     So people should be prepared to be in a hospital gown for that.
},
{
    99.26,100.46
     Very good point.
},
{
    100.46,102.54
     And not only should they expect to be in a hospital gown,
},
{
    102.54,104.54
     but they should expect to be completely naked
},
{
    104.54,105.06
     under that gown
},
{
    105.06,107.58
     Because we really want to examine all parts of the body
},
{
    108.1,111.16
     Especially the areas that might be very difficult for the patient to see themselves.
},
{
    111.16,113.76
     So you're just going to be checking my arms and legs today?
},
{
    113.76,119.22
     Yes, I'm actually going to use a dermatoscope. This is a magnifying light with a polarizing lens
},
{
    119.22,126.32
     So I can really very carefully look at the asymmetry issue, borders, color variations, those type of things.
},
{
    126.32,129.9
     They typically start at the hands, you know, and we look at the areas under the nails as
},
{
    129.9,131.74
     well as between the digits.
},
{
    131.74,135.5
     And then I sort of work my way up, taking a look really very carefully at all the skin
},
{
    135.5,140.46
     areas and identifying sort of on a more broader view if there's anything in particular that
},
{
    140.46,141.96
     I want to hone in on.
},
{
    141.96,147.92
     So I'm going to do that right here since you have a tiny mole right here. And so this is a completely benign appearing mole. It
},
{
    147.92,152.72
     has beautiful, very, very sharp edged margins. It has a completely normal and
},
{
    152.72,156.76
     regular reticular pattern, so nothing here concerning. If I was very concerned
},
{
    156.76,160.64
     on today's visit, we would actually proceed right to a surgical biopsy. And
},
{
    160.64,164.2
     that's typically done either with somebody like myself or a dermatologist's
},
{
    164.2,168.36
     office, and it would be a very small, simple procedure done under local anesthesia.
},
{
    168.36,172.2
     So it sounds like the main takeaway is to come in for your annual appointment, but also
},
{
    172.2,174.52
     really be keeping an eye on things yourself.
},
{
    174.52,179.16
     So having a routine skin exam by a healthcare professional once a year can literally make
},
{
    179.16,183.44
     a big difference, but aiding into that is the patient being very self-aware of their
},
{
    183.44,187.08
     own skin and performing their self-skin examinations on a regular basis.
},
{
    187.08,188.72
     Thank you so much.
