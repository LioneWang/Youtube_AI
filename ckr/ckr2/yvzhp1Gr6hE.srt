     Hello, I'm Dr. Michael Brown with Meritas Health in North Kansas City Hospital, and
},
{
    6.48,10.72
     I'm here today to talk to you about how to use an Albuteronhaler appropriately.
},
{
    10.72,13.32
     Why is it important to use your Albuteronhaler appropriately?
},
{
    13.32,18.92
     Well, most people, when they use it incorrectly, get less than 10% of the medication with
},
{
    18.92,20.52
     each dose.
},
{
    20.52,26.1
     At best, when you use the inhaler appropriately, you're getting only about 50% of the medication in your lungs.
},
{
    26.1,29.5
     So it's very important that you use it as directed.
},
{
    29.5,32.54
     The most common prescription for albuterol
},
{
    32.54,35.82
     typically comes in two brands, either pro-air or venaline.
},
{
    35.82,39.14
     So your inhaler will probably say one of those two brands.
},
{
    39.14,42.7
     But for the sake of this video, I'll refer to it as albuterol.
},
{
    42.7,49.24
     Typically it's prescribed to do two puffs of your inhaler each time you have an episode of chest tightness or
},
{
    49.24,53.98
     wheezing. It's important that you review with your primary care provider how to
},
{
    53.98,57.58
     use it and when to use your albuterol inhaler appropriately if you have any
},
{
    57.58,61.56
     questions regarding it. Your albuterol inhaler works as what is called a beta
},
{
    61.56,65.76
     agonist. This takes advantage of what we call the fight or flight response.
},
{
    65.76,68.6
     For instance, when a bear jumps out at you in the woods.
},
{
    68.6,72.04
     Well, it's very important for your lungs to open up in that kind of situation and give
},
{
    72.04,75.48
     you as much air as possible so you can run away from the bear.
},
{
    75.48,76.48
     That's what albuterol does.
},
{
    76.48,77.8
     It takes advantage of that.
},
{
    77.8,81.88
     And that's why after using this inhaler, you might feel things like your heart racing
},
{
    81.88,83.04
     or fluttering.
},
{
    83.04,85.8
     That can be very normal after using your Albuterol inhaler.
},
{
    85.8,89.28
     And if you have any concerns with the side effects of Albuterol, please be sure again
},
{
    89.28,92.72
     to bring them up with your primary care provider.
},
{
    92.72,96.52
     If it's the first time that you've ever used your inhaler, you actually need to prime your
},
{
    96.52,97.72
     inhaler.
},
{
    97.72,102.52
     This means pushing it down until you get a nice even spray.
},
{
    102.52,108.96
     So you'll push it down a few times until you get a nice steady even spray. You need to prime your inhaler the first
},
{
    108.96,110.12
     time you've ever used it
},
{
    110.12,114.28
     or if you haven't used it in more than two weeks or after you may drop the
},
{
    114.28,114.92
     inhaler.
},
{
    114.92,118.04
     It's very important to do that to make sure you get a nice steady
},
{
    118.04,123.84
     solid even spray each time you use it. I'm now going to review with you
},
{
    123.84,125.48
     the appropriate steps for using your
},
{
    125.48,128.84
     inhaler. The first thing you'll want to do is take your cap off and make sure it's
},
{
    128.84,134.28
     clean and clean the mouthpiece off. You'll then want to shake it 10 to 15 times.
},
{
    134.28,139.2
     Without the inhaler you'll want to take a big deep breath in and a big deep breath
},
{
    139.2,145.4
     out all the way. You'll then take the inhaler and you'll put it in between your lips and above your
},
{
    145.4,149.28
     tongue.
},
{
    149.28,153.32
     Before you press down on the inhaler, you'll actually want to begin breathing in slowly.
},
{
    153.32,157.44
     A lot of people will push it down and then begin breathing in, but that's not appropriate.
},
{
    157.44,161.36
     What you should do first is start breathing in and then push down your inhaler so that
},
{
    161.36,164.6
     you get the maximum amount of the medication.
},
{
    164.6,169.64
     This is a training inhaler and so it actually makes a noise when I start breathing in.
},
{
    169.64,173.6
     Your inhaler will not do that, but this is so that you get an idea of what I'm doing
},
{
    173.6,174.6
     on this video.
},
{
    174.6,179.1
     So when you hear that noise, you'll know I've been breathing in.
},
{
    179.1,183.72
     After you begin to breathe in slowly, you'll push the inhaler and you'll take a big deep
},
{
    183.72,184.72
     breath in.
},
{
    184.72,185.12
     Now this is the
},
{
    185.12,189.48
     most important part. Again, as I said earlier, you don't want to breathe in quickly and then
},
{
    189.48,193.12
     immediately exhale the medication. Remember, that all it gets to hear and we want to get
},
{
    193.12,197.16
     it down to here. So what you're going to do is after you breathe in all the way, you'll
},
{
    197.16,202.12
     want to hold your breath as much as you possibly can. Usually about 10 seconds is what we're
},
{
    202.12,205.6
     trying to go for here. But as long as you're able to comfortably hold your breath in
},
{
    205.6,212.16
     The more medication are going to get in after you've done about 10 seconds of holding your breath in you'll want to breathe out slowly
},
{
    213.4,215.4
     Again, you don't want to breathe out too fast
},
{
    216.08,221.34
     So I'm going to demonstrate these steps for you again. Remember taking the cap off making sure it's clean
},
{
    222.04,223.64
     shaking the inhaler
},
{
    223.64,228.88
     taking a deep breath in, out.
},
{
    244.56,248.52
     Now doing this twice is typically a full dose.
},
{
    248.52,253.5
     So I would repeat those steps one more time to get my second puff of that dose.
},
{
    253.5,256.6
     Some points to remember, do everything slowly.
},
{
    256.6,260.32
     Breathe the medication in slowly, breathe the medication out slowly.
},
{
    260.32,265.6
     Also, I recommend that after you use your inhaler, you always rinse out your mouth and
},
{
    265.6,267.32
     brush your teeth.
},
{
    267.32,271.52
     If the medication is not working for you appropriately or you're not getting the response that you
},
{
    271.52,275.88
     used to get from your inhaler, please be sure to follow up with your primary care provider
},
{
    275.88,281.36
     so that they can talk with you about what needs to happen next.
},
{
    281.36,285.2
     Thank you again for letting me teach you how to use an albedo on healer appropriately.
},
{
    285.2,289.16
     Once again I'm Dr. Michael Brown with Meritaz Health and North Kansas City Hospital.
