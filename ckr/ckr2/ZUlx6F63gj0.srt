     My name is Sarah. I'm a certified diabetes educator. I'm here today to demonstrate

     how to use a glucagon emergency kit. Glucagon is a medication that's used for
},
{
    12.04,18.4
     severe hypoglycemia or low blood sugar. It's given when a person is unable to
},
{
    18.4,27.12
     take food or fluids by mouth. It's typically given by a bystander, a family member, friend, colleague, someone
},
{
    27.12,34.96
     who has witnessed the hypoglycemic event. The first thing to do in a hypoglycemic emergency
},
{
    34.96,41.76
     is to retrieve your glucagon kit and open the kit. You're going to find two things
},
{
    41.76,45.88
     inside. One is a vial which will contain a powder
},
{
    45.88,51.52
     medication. The other is a syringe which has liquid solution in it. You're going
},
{
    51.52,56.34
     to flip off the top of the vial and pull off the cap to the needle on the
},
{
    56.34,63.96
     syringe. Then you want to inject the solution into the vial and swirl it
},
{
    63.96,67.62
     around until you see that that medication has
},
{
    67.62,72.08
     dissolved and it becomes clear. And you're going to turn it upside down and
},
{
    72.08,79.16
     draw the solution back into the syringe until you've gotten all of it out of the
},
{
    79.16,86.9
     vial. Then you're ready to give it. Hold your syringe like a writing pen or a dart and you would
},
{
    86.9,93.44
     give the glucagon in any place that you can give insulin, which would be the abdomen,
},
{
    93.44,109.0
     the thighs, the arms and then take it out.
},
{
    109.0,115.08
     Meanwhile, you want to make sure that that person is placed on their side because
},
{
    115.08,121.88
     glucagon can sometimes cause nausea and vomiting. The patient should respond, become
},
{
    121.88,127.32
     alert and awake within less than 15 minutes.
},
{
    127.32,132.8
     If they do not respond, you want to call 911.
},
{
    132.8,138.24
     When the person wakes up enough to be able to swallow, you want to treat that hypoglycemia
},
{
    138.24,141.84
     with some form of carbohydrate.
},
{
    141.84,146.12
     15 grams of carbohydrate is specifically what we'd like to see you
},
{
    146.12,153.08
     treat with. That can come in the form of glucose tablets, that would be four of them, or four
},
{
    153.08,161.14
     ounces of fruit juice or sugar, sweetened soda, not diet. You can also treat with a
},
{
    161.14,167.92
     tablespoon sugar, honey, or syrup. And then wait 15 minutes, recheck the blood sugar.
},
{
    167.92,174.84
     If you're not yet in goal, you would treat it again and wait 15 minutes again.
},
{
    174.84,179.92
     After you've established that the patient is at goal blood sugar, you want to be frequently
},
{
    179.92,187.12
     monitoring for the next three to four hours every 30 to 60 minutes. If you're having trouble
},
{
    187.12,192.96
     maintaining that blood glucose, then call 911 or seek emergency medical assistance.
