     Hi, my name is Francis Nguyen and today we're going to be talking about simple oxygen mass.
},
{
    5.2,24.4
     So stay tuned for the next couple of minutes.
},
{
    24.4,26.36
     So simple oxygen masks.
},
{
    26.36,31.56
     You've seen these, they're all on the medical shows, also just about everywhere in the healthcare
},
{
    31.56,37.36
     systems, hospital, urgent care, wherever they have oxygen.
},
{
    37.36,42.84
     Not seen as much use in the clinical setting, something that's usually used in place of
},
{
    42.84,50.0
     a nasal cannula. If more of FIO2 is needed and a patient is keeping their mouth open while wearing a nasal cannula,
},
{
    50.0,53.0
     this would be probably a better fit device for that patient.
},
{
    53.0,58.0
     Now this device still falls into our low flow oxygen devices category.
},
{
    58.0,66.0
     And as I said before, a low flow oxygen device is defined as a device that can only meet
},
{
    66.0,72.88
     part of a patient's inspiratory demands. Again, just simply means for your less critical patients
},
{
    72.88,80.48
     who do not have very large respiratory requirements, who are not working to breathe.
},
{
    81.28,88.72
     Now, some indications for this device. Patients with a PAO2 of less than 60 millimeters
},
{
    88.72,95.52
     of mercury or an SPO2 of less than 90%. Now in the chronic settings like COPD patients,
},
{
    96.08,103.84
     anywhere less than 55 millimeters of mercury of oxygen or an SPO2 of less than 88%, which is indicated.
},
{
    108.88,114.4
     and sp02 of less than 88% which is indicated. And again the main functions is to decrease the work of the heart, decrease work of breathing and obviously
},
{
    114.4,120.0
     reverse hypoxemia. Now some contraindications for the device. You're
},
{
    120.0,125.74
     gonna be having patients who are apnick, you know, they need to be breathing.
},
{
    125.74,132.76
     Patients who are going into or are already in respiratory failure or patients who have
},
{
    132.76,138.48
     some sort of facial injury or deformities that prohibit use of the device.
},
{
    138.48,145.2
     Okay, so let's get into some of the specs for this device.
},
{
    145.2,152.16
     Now this device requires a minimum of 5 liters per minute, oxygen running through your flow
},
{
    152.16,157.76
     meter and can be all the way up to about 10 liters per minute.
},
{
    157.76,168.88
     You know, FIO2 delivered by this device is around 35 to 55 percent, Not accounting for anatomy or anything of that nature.
},
{
    168.88,173.68
     That's something that your professor will probably talk more about later on in your anatomy and your
},
{
    173.68,186.44
     procedure scores. So things to remember. Always get rid of your packaging or your equipment when it's either visibly soiled, torn packaging,
},
{
    186.44,196.08
     falls on the floor, or maybe defective in some manner, way, shape, or form. So now
},
{
    196.08,200.04
     after this all this information is said let's go and get our equipment ready
},
{
    200.04,205.48
     you go. Alright so we're back from the equipment room.
},
{
    205.48,207.64
     So here's everything you're going to need.
},
{
    207.64,210.44
     You're going to listen to the left right here.
},
{
    210.44,213.84
     You're going to need a flow meter nipple adapter.
},
{
    213.84,219.48
     You're going to need a flow meter for the wall or for an oxygen source like this one.
},
{
    219.48,224.44
     And then you're also going to need your simple oxygen mask packaging, which includes your
},
{
    224.44,227.2
     mask, the headstrap, plus
},
{
    227.2,233.84
     your oxygen tubing to go with it. So with that being said, let's go into looking at up close what
},
{
    233.84,242.48
     this device looks like. Alright, so looking at the packaging here, we have just your simple
},
{
    242.48,245.6
     sterile seal package. You're going to simply
},
{
    245.6,251.6
     open which this is a very good package. It actually opens really easily. So get rid of
},
{
    251.6,262.08
     your plastic, your paper. So first off you got your mask, okay. Okay, now you got your
},
{
    262.08,267.8
     nose clip on the top, just aluminum piece. You squeeze down to fit the patient's nose.
},
{
    267.8,272.0
     You have your oxygen tubing port here on the mask.
},
{
    272.0,276.12
     So if you can see it from the side, let me show this to you right here.
},
{
    276.12,277.18
     So you see this right here.
},
{
    277.18,280.02
     This is where your oxygen tubing is going to connect.
},
{
    280.02,285.48
     You got your green head strap that goes around the back of the patient's head right here,
},
{
    285.48,287.36
     all this right here.
},
{
    287.36,293.6
     And if you'll notice, when you're looking at this mask, so there's no valves on this,
},
{
    293.6,298.64
     so this is open to the room air, which is mainly why this device only delivers up to
},
{
    298.64,307.84
     about 55, maybe 60% FiO2, just because it's mixing with the room air and so you won't get as high concentrations
},
{
    307.84,310.08
     but it's pretty good for most patients.
},
{
    310.92,319.18
     So, easy to set up, all you simply do, you just take one end of your oxygen tubing right here,
},
{
    319.56,322.8
     you're gonna take it, connect it to the end and that's it.
},
{
    323.94,325.62
     You're pretty much ready to go.
},
{
    325.62,327.36
     So let's go over to the flow meter
},
{
    327.36,330.0
     and you can kinda see how we connect it,
},
{
    330.0,332.16
     which is just one easy step.
},
{
    332.16,336.88
     So, all right, so now I got your oxygen mask here, okay?
},
{
    336.88,340.0
     So while holding this in one hand,
},
{
    340.0,341.4
     you're gonna take your other hand
},
{
    341.4,344.0
     and you're gonna connect this to your flow meter.
},
{
    344.0,349.78
     But before that happens, first you'll notice that this flow meter has no nipple adapter.
},
{
    349.78,356.68
     So you wanna take your flow adapter, you wanna put it on here, right, tidy, lefty-loosey.
},
{
    356.68,359.44
     Make sure there's tight, no leaks.
},
{
    359.44,365.0
     Okay, so once it's secured, then all you gotta do is take this,
},
{
    365.76,369.16
     take the oxygen tube, simply snug it on to the bottom
},
{
    369.16,372.66
     of your flow meter nipple adapter, turn on your flow,
},
{
    374.28,375.6
     and you are good to go.
},
{
    375.6,378.96
     So that's it for the device as far as setting it up
},
{
    378.96,381.68
     to the wall, so let me show you how this should go
},
{
    381.68,383.92
     on the patient and what to look for
},
{
    383.92,387.68
     when you're setting this up on a patient. Alright so here we are we have reached the patient's
},
{
    387.68,394.84
     room we've gotten our two identifiers named date of birth and so now doctors
},
{
    394.84,401.8
     has ordered 60% FIO2 by simple mass so we've already turned on airflow to about
},
{
    401.8,405.28
     10 liters per minute on our flow meter. Now what we're
},
{
    405.28,409.64
     gonna do, we're gonna come around the patient, okay, we're gonna be in front of
},
{
    409.64,414.36
     them. I'm just doing it from behind for demonstration purposes. So you're gonna
},
{
    414.36,421.32
     take your strap, run it to the back of their head over the ear, okay, and then
},
{
    421.32,425.0
     you're gonna simply fit the mask to the patient.
},
{
    426.82,429.54
     Now, you'll wanna come with the nose clip
},
{
    429.54,431.78
     to the bridge of the nose,
},
{
    431.78,434.66
     and you wanna kinda pinch it in
},
{
    434.66,436.9
     so it kinda fits their nose better,
},
{
    436.9,438.3
     so it kinda hold on.
},
{
    439.26,441.98
     And you wanna kinda adjust the mask
},
{
    441.98,446.08
     to make sure that you got an appropriate seal. So you see,
},
{
    447.12,452.24
     see right here, you got a pretty good seal here. Now it's not going to be perfect obviously because
},
{
    452.24,456.72
     you got the little ports on the sides, but you want to best of a seal as you can around the nose
},
{
    456.72,463.2
     and mouth just so they're getting the optimal amount of FIO2 that's required. So you're going to
},
{
    463.2,465.04
     look from the side here, so you gotta make
},
{
    465.04,469.36
     sure your straps not like you know down here, you know you kind of want to appear
},
{
    469.36,475.12
     above their ear, just right to the back of their head, and then you can always
},
{
    475.12,481.32
     adjust accordingly with your straps on the front here with a little shoelace.
},
{
    481.32,486.02
     So some notes to know for this device.
},
{
    486.02,493.58
     When you're using this device right here, now you'll want to observe your patient's
},
{
    493.58,507.92
     vital signs, look at their work of breathing, how hard they are working to breathe and you know if it's not enough let's say you're
},
{
    507.92,512.48
     only at five liters per minute and they're trying to work a little bit and
},
{
    512.48,518.12
     you're noticing some misting in the mask it's probably a good sign that they're
},
{
    518.12,522.24
     probably still not getting enough flow so try to give them a couple more liters
},
{
    522.24,525.5
     on the flow meter maybe up up to six, seven, eight
},
{
    525.5,529.58
     liters per minute, or just go all the way up to ten, which it should be pretty safe
},
{
    529.58,533.1
     most times unless indicated.
},
{
    533.1,537.18
     And if you don't see the missing anymore in the mask, which you'll see it, you know, around
},
{
    537.18,542.14
     the mouth there, the nose, if you don't see the missing anymore, then pretty good chance
},
{
    542.14,545.2
     that you have enough flow going to the patient.
},
{
    545.2,550.72
     So it's just enough for them. They're comfortable, you make sure their vitals are stable and you're
},
{
    550.72,558.64
     good to go. So that's pretty much all you need to use this device. Not very hard, very easy, and
},
{
    560.48,567.64
     literally takes about 10 seconds to set up. So not too difficult, but again, if you're
},
{
    567.64,572.44
     new to this, you might be nervous, don't be, you'll do this plenty of times, I'm sure of
},
{
    572.44,578.72
     it, and you'll get great at it. So let's try to summarize what we talked about in this
},
{
    578.72,591.0
     video. So let's summarize what we've talked about in this video. Simple mask, it's very simple to use, hence the name, simple hydrogen mask.
},
{
    591.0,597.08
     Five to ten liters per minute on the flow meter as far as flow goes, delivers approximately
},
{
    597.08,602.76
     35 to 55 percent FiO2, non-clinic anatomy.
},
{
    602.76,606.64
     And again, just like all our oxygen devices, it reduces work
},
{
    606.64,612.12
     at breathing, reduces work at the heart, and reverses hypoxemia. Great alternative
},
{
    612.12,619.64
     to the nasal cannula. Again, not used as often as you would think, but it still
},
{
    619.64,625.74
     exists in the hospital and is still used on a regular basis, but I wouldn't say as much as say things
},
{
    625.74,628.12
     like nasal cannula.
},
{
    628.12,632.48
     So again, keep practicing.
},
{
    632.48,636.4
     If you don't feel comfortable with it, you know, you always have a lab like this to come
},
{
    636.4,642.28
     into the practice, plug it in, put it in on your classmates, do what you need to do to
},
{
    642.28,645.36
     feel comfortable before your first clinicals.
},
{
    645.36,652.12
     So as always, study hard and breathe easy and we'll see you in the next one.
},
