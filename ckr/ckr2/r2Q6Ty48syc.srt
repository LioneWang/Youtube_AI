     Today we're going to go over some exercises for the condition Osgood
},
{
    3.04,6.88
     Slaughter. They're going to help to increase the mobility in your hip and your knee,
},
{
    6.88,10.32
     and also strengthen the muscles around the hip joint. Let's get started.
},
{
    11.04,14.88
     For this exercise you'll need the foam roller. We're going to be rolling the quad muscle or the
},
{
    14.88,19.2
     muscles on the front portion of your thigh, and this is going to help to release that tension
},
{
    19.2,24.16
     in your quads and help to decrease the pain that you may be experiencing in the front portion of
},
{
    24.16,29.48
     that knee. So you're going to go ahead and lay down onto the foam roller and in this position you want to make sure your elbows are
},
{
    29.48,34.64
     underneath your shoulders and you're keeping a nice tight core and making sure that back doesn't sag down.
},
{
    34.8,38.9
     We're going to go through three different positions with our legs for this exercise.
},
{
    38.9,41.9
     So the first would be just here with our toes pointed down.
},
{
    42.0,45.04
     The next is going to be spreading our legs out and rotating
},
{
    45.04,49.52
     them outwards so our toes are pointing out. The third is going to be bringing our legs
},
{
    49.52,54.16
     inwards so rotating them in and our toes will be pointing towards one another, making sure we're
},
{
    54.16,59.52
     rotating the entire leg for those three positions. Now during those three positions this is what you're
},
{
    59.52,64.88
     going to be doing. You're going to be rolling and scanning from above the knee all the way to right
},
{
    64.88,65.2
     below the hips looking for any areas that might be a little tender or uncomfortable. Now when doing. You're going to be rolling and scanning from above the knee all the way to right below
},
{
    65.2,70.0
     the hips, looking for any areas that might be a little tender or uncomfortable. Now when you
},
{
    70.0,75.44
     find a location that's uncomfortable, you're going to stop there and you can either hold or do small
},
{
    75.44,80.96
     little movements up and down trying to work that area out. Now that tenderness may not go away
},
{
    80.96,88.96
     completely, but once it lessens, go ahead and search the area again for another location that might be tender. Remembering, keep a good posture
},
{
    88.96,92.66
     in this position and you're going to go through those three positions where your
},
{
    92.66,97.4
     toes are down, rotating legs outward and rotating the legs inward. You'll
},
{
    97.4,102.8
     complete this twice a day and do it for two minutes. For this exercise we're
},
{
    102.8,107.0
     going to do the 90-90 stretch. This is going to help increase the mobility in the hip region.
},
{
    107.0,112.0
     So you're going to sit on the ground and you're going to put one leg out in front of you and one leg out to the side.
},
{
    112.0,117.0
     Making sure your hips, knees, and ankles are in the 90-degree angle.
},
{
    117.0,123.0
     Now, once you're in this position, you're not going to be able to sit up completely, so you can use your hand on the ground.
},
{
    123.0,127.84
     The goal here is to sit up without having your hand on the ground, making sure you're
},
{
    127.84,133.24
     pushing this hip down as far as you can and keeping contact with the knees on the floor.
},
{
    133.24,136.48
     You're going to hold here and feel that stretch throughout the hip region.
},
{
    136.48,140.76
     So you're going to complete this two times a day, trying to work your way up to holding
},
{
    140.76,143.08
     this position for two minutes.
},
{
    143.08,147.5
     But at first, you may only be able to hold it for 30 seconds and that's fine.
},
{
    147.5,149.8
     And make sure you complete this on both sides.
},
{
    149.8,154.06
     You also may find differences between one side and the other.
},
{
    154.06,157.24
     One may seem really easy and the other really difficult.
},
{
    157.24,161.56
     So keep up the good work and try to get up to that two minute hold.
},
{
    161.56,168.8
     For this exercise, we're going to be strengthening the glutes, the muscles around your hip and the hamstring muscle, the muscles on the backside of the thigh. So you're going
},
{
    168.8,173.4
     to lay on the ground by a wall and you're going to put your feet up onto that wall,
},
{
    173.4,177.04
     making sure your feet are a little higher than your knees. Now in this position you're
},
{
    177.04,181.28
     going to squeeze your glutes and raise your hips up off the ground. This is going to help
},
{
    181.28,186.0
     activate our glute muscles and then we're going to push our feet down towards the ground.
},
{
    186.0,188.0
     We're not actually going to do any movement.
},
{
    188.0,191.0
     We're just going to apply pressure through those heels towards the floor.
},
{
    191.0,194.0
     When you do that, it activates the hamstring muscles.
},
{
    194.0,199.0
     So you're going to hold this position and we're trying to hold it for 30 seconds.
},
{
    199.0,204.0
     If you can't hold it for 30 seconds, rest and then go back into the exercise.
},
{
    204.0,205.8
     We're going to do this two times a day.
},
{
    205.8,210.24
     You're going to do two sets trying to reach that 30 second hold.
},
{
    210.24,212.36
     We hope these exercises were helpful for you.
