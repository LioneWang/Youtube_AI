},
{
    4.04,9.32
     And this is how to eliminate those annoying muscle knots in your upper back. Let's get into it right now
},
{
    19.2,21.32
     All right, you guys hate it's gonna be a good one today
},
{
    21.56,25.98
     Who doesn't get muscle knots in like their neck and upper shoulders and upper back?
},
{
    26.52,34.16
     Fortunately, there's a lot of cool things that you can do right at home with minimal equipment to alleviate tension to alleviate pain in some of those areas.
},
{
    34.16,37.3
     I hope that the things I share with you guys today help you out if they do.

     Okay, you guys, so these muscle knots,
},
{
    47.74,49.06
     these areas of contraction,
},
{
    49.06,51.18
     there's a couple of different things that cause them.
},
{
    51.18,53.36
     Posture issues is probably the first.
},
{
    53.36,55.0
     If you have poor posture,
},
{
    55.0,57.84
     that can be one of the causes for these muscle knots.
},
{
    57.84,59.38
     Check the description down below
},
{
    59.38,61.34
     for a video that I shot about posture.
},
{
    61.34,63.66
     I'm also gonna float that video right up here right now.
},
{
    63.66,68.08
     Click on that link to help you correct your posture. The other thing that kind
},
{
    68.08,72.44
     of spurred this video is one of my more popular videos here on YouTube is how to
},
{
    72.44,76.36
     eliminate muscle knots in your neck and your upper shoulders. A lot of the
},
{
    76.36,79.76
     comments that I get on that video include, well, what if my knots are a little
},
{
    79.76,82.96
     lower? What if they're in my upper back, not necessarily my neck and upper
},
{
    82.96,88.76
     shoulders? And so that's where this video is coming from right now you guys if you're not or is in your neck in your upper shoulder
},
{
    88.88,93.88
     That's a little bit different techniques than what I'm gonna recommend today again. Check the description down below
},
{
    94.0,96.4
     I'm also gonna float that video right up here right now
},
{
    96.76,102.92
     That's the one that you want for knots in those areas if you have knots between your shoulder blades and into your upper back
},
{
    103.0,104.28
     You're in the right spot
},
{
    104.28,108.32
     So what we need to do is we need to get some blood flow into the area first things first,
},
{
    108.32,113.52
     you guys. I recommend a heating pad for that. I want you to lay on a heating pad for about 15
},
{
    113.52,117.28
     minutes. Now if you don't have a heating pad, check the description down below. That's the one
},
{
    117.28,122.24
     that I recommend to patients on a daily basis. Works great. What we want to do is just open up
},
{
    122.24,125.56
     those capillaries, promote blood flow into that area.
},
{
    125.56,127.36
     I typically recommend heat for that.
},
{
    127.36,129.56
     Okay, now let's get into some of the stretches,
},
{
    129.56,131.64
     some of the exercises that you can do
},
{
    131.64,134.88
     to mobilize your spine, to alleviate that knot.
},
{
    134.88,137.4
     I'm actually gonna go get my wife for this one, you guys.
},
{
    137.4,138.24
     I'll be right back.
},
{
    138.24,141.72
     I'm gonna go grab her and we'll show you these exercises.
},
{
    141.72,143.52
     All right, you guys, here she is again.
},
{
    143.52,147.8
     My lovely assistant slash exercise demonstrator
},
{
    147.8,148.8
     extraordinaire.
},
{
    148.8,151.56
     Slash the only one here at home to help them.
},
{
    151.56,154.16
     The only one here at home to help me, you guys.
},
{
    154.16,159.36
     No, so Camille actually gets some muscle knots in her neck and shoulders and back pretty regularly.
},
{
    159.36,161.76
     So she's kind of a master of these exercises, you guys.
},
{
    161.76,164.96
     So thought it'd be good to bring her in to demonstrate some of these for you.
},
{
    164.96,167.14
     So let's get into them right now. So the
},
{
    167.14,170.92
     first thing that I want to show you is a way that we can actually kind of fatigue
},
{
    170.92,175.68
     the muscle in that area. What that does is it kind of helps it to reset in order
},
{
    175.68,179.56
     to eliminate that muscle knot. And so for this example let's say that Camille's
},
{
    179.56,184.08
     muscle knots over here on the right side kind of right shoulder blade area. What
},
{
    184.08,188.26
     we want to do is contract all the muscles in that area to fatigue it to help it to reset.
},
{
    188.26,192.36
     So in order to do that, Camille's going to elevate, so she's going to raise up that right
},
{
    192.36,193.36
     shoulder.
},
{
    193.36,195.58
     She's going to pull the shoulder backwards.
},
{
    195.58,197.3
     She's going to extend her head.
},
{
    197.3,201.22
     Now she's going to lean towards it, and now she's going to rotate away from it.
},
{
    201.22,204.06
     So you're going to rotate your face up that direction.
},
{
    204.06,208.24
     She's going to hold that for about a three to five second count and then relax. It's kind of
},
{
    208.24,211.56
     confusing to get into so let's help you out one more time. So again this is for
},
{
    211.56,215.76
     that right side. She's going to elevate, she's going to pull it backwards, she's
},
{
    215.76,219.44
     going to extend her head, she's going to side bend her head, she's going to lean
},
{
    219.44,223.84
     towards it and then she's going to rotate away from it. And what you should
},
{
    223.84,228.12
     feel is just a really good tight contraction of all those muscles in that area
},
{
    228.12,231.76
     She's gonna hold that for about three to five seconds and then she's gonna relax
},
{
    231.88,236.82
     She's gonna do that ten times. There's your first exercise next. Let's grab our foam roller
},
{
    238.04,243.88
     And then if you guys don't have one of these at home, um honestly, it's like one of our favorite therapy tools
},
{
    243.92,250.4
     We actually you have muscle nuts. This is this is this is a moneymaker right here, you guys. I had to go pull this.
},
{
    250.4,254.16
     I had to go pull this like it was upstairs in our living room because we're on it like all the time.
},
{
    254.16,259.84
     If you don't have one, I like this one. This is six inches in diameter. It's 36 inches in length.
},
{
    259.84,263.44
     Check the link down below in the description. I've got a link to this one that you guys can go check
},
{
    263.44,267.6
     it out. And so a big cause of your muscle knots
},
{
    267.6,269.88
     is because your thoracic spine or your upper back
},
{
    269.88,272.12
     just isn't moving the way that it should.
},
{
    272.12,274.64
     This is a great way to not only massage those muscle knots,
},
{
    274.64,277.0
     but to also promote mobilization and movement
},
{
    277.0,278.44
     in that upper back.
},
{
    278.44,280.6
     And so we've got a perpendicular to her spine.
},
{
    280.6,283.0
     She's got it up kind of right on her neck level.
},
{
    283.0,288.12
     Right now, she's going to reach behind her head, support her head with her hands, lift her hips up.
},
{
    288.12,293.6
     Now she's going to use her legs to push herself up towards her head and then right back down.
},
{
    293.6,295.6
     Nice and slow as we go over this.
},
{
    295.6,300.32
     The thing that I always try to mention with this is I don't want you to stay like completely
},
{
    300.32,302.92
     stiff, completely rigid while you're on this.
},
{
    302.92,307.1
     You'll see that as Camille goes up and over it, she's gonna let her head actually kind of fall down
},
{
    307.1,309.5
     towards the ground, just so that we can be sure
},
{
    309.5,313.94
     that your spine is actually expanding over that foam roller.
},
{
    313.94,316.34
     And really what I do in my clinic is I'll just set a timer.
},
{
    316.34,318.1
     I'll just put you on this for like two minutes
},
{
    318.1,321.6
     and say spend about that amount of time mobilizing
},
{
    321.6,323.46
     and extending through your spine.
},
{
    323.46,324.3
     Nice job, babe.
},
{
    324.3,325.04
     I might not get her off
},
{
    325.04,331.68
     of you guys. No it's not so good. She's on all the time. Now if you don't have convenient access
},
{
    331.68,337.52
     to a foam roller, you can do a very similar stretch, a very similar exercise. Go ahead and hop down.
},
{
    337.52,342.72
     There we go. It's over the back of a chair and so she's in a very sturdy chair. It's got a very
},
{
    342.72,345.96
     firm back. I don't want anything that swivels or reclines or anything
},
{
    346.04,350.26
     She's gonna sit in the chair and then you can see that she puts her hands up behind her head
},
{
    350.34,357.36
     Same thing we're gonna try to work that extension through the upper back as she bends over the top of that chair that way
},
{
    357.46,362.98
     Now you can kind of vary where this hits depending on your posture if she wants it to hit a little higher
},
{
    362.98,366.76
     She can slouch a little bit if she wants it to hit a little higher, she can slouch a little bit. If she wants it to hit a little lower in her back,
},
{
    366.76,369.04
     she can sit up kind of straighter and taller
},
{
    369.04,371.56
     and then extend back over the chair.
},
{
    371.56,373.64
     Extend back over the chair that way.
},
{
    373.64,376.68
     Same thing, spend about two minutes doing that one.
},
{
    376.68,378.88
     Next, we're gonna get back up on the table.
},
{
    378.88,380.72
     She's gonna get up there on all fours
},
{
    380.72,383.4
     and we're gonna throw, you guys have seen this one before.
},
{
    383.4,388.84
     This one's the cat cow or the cat camel. Don't ask me which pose is which. I have my ideas, you
},
{
    388.84,392.8
     probably have yours. But the idea is to get, I'm gonna pull your hair over this
},
{
    392.8,397.28
     way, the idea is to get as much motion as possible through this upper back, through
},
{
    397.28,400.56
     where those knots are kind of occurring. So to do that we want to
},
{
    400.56,404.24
     introduce flexion and extension. So to introduce the flexion she's gonna pull
},
{
    404.24,406.9
     her back up towards the ceiling, really trying to round allion and extension. So to introduce the flexion, she's going to pull her back up towards the ceiling, really
},
{
    406.9,408.96
     trying to round all the way out.
},
{
    408.96,413.68
     She tucks her chin down into her chest just until she gets a really good stretch through
},
{
    413.68,415.48
     this area right here.
},
{
    415.48,418.04
     She's going to hold that for about a three to five second count.
},
{
    418.04,420.0
     And then I call that one the angry cat.
},
{
    420.0,421.52
     I don't know, that's what it reminds me of.
},
{
    421.52,427.52
     The camel or the cow part of this is she's going to go the opposite way. So now we're promoting extension through her upper back
},
{
    427.52,429.32
     and through her lower back right here.
},
{
    429.32,430.84
     Hold that one for three to five.
},
{
    430.84,435.88
     And then again, through the cat pose, flexion,
},
{
    435.88,437.04
     we're gonna introduce that one,
},
{
    437.04,438.42
     hold that one for three to five,
},
{
    438.42,440.04
     and then go back the other way.
},
{
    440.04,442.94
     She's gonna do that about 30 reps total
},
{
    442.94,445.28
     is what I typically recommend with that one.
},
{
    445.28,446.88
     It looks good, babe.
},
{
    446.88,451.36
     Okay, so now let's introduce you guys to, there's two more self massage techniques that
},
{
    451.36,452.96
     I really like.
},
{
    452.96,455.36
     And so go ahead and sit down.
},
{
    455.36,459.88
     And so this is the other best friend here at the Beckstrand house.
},
{
    459.88,461.56
     This is a Theracane, you guys.
},
{
    461.56,465.56
     This is a great tool for self mobilmobilization or self-massage.
},
{
    465.56,468.8
     I'm actually going to have you flip around to the other side, babe.
},
{
    468.8,475.36
     And what you do with this one, it's got different handles on it and these different nubs right
},
{
    475.36,479.48
     here, these different balls, where you can actually find those spots on your back.
},
{
    479.48,481.04
     I'll give that to you.
},
{
    481.04,485.46
     So she can actually find those knots down here on her back between her shoulder
},
{
    485.46,486.46
     blades.
},
{
    486.46,488.4
     You always go right to that one.
},
{
    488.4,489.4
     That's the one.
},
{
    489.4,492.32
     That's her spot right there, right on that right side.
},
{
    492.32,494.2
     And then you can just apply pressure to that.
},
{
    494.2,497.86
     And typically what I tell people is as soon as you find that knot, put a little pressure
},
{
    497.86,502.92
     on it, kind of lean into it a little bit and really hold that for about 20 to 30 seconds
},
{
    502.92,505.86
     per your pain tolerance.
},
{
    507.32,509.32
     And what you should feel with that is that muscle actually release
},
{
    509.32,511.48
     as that tension decreases in that area,
},
{
    511.48,512.96
     you'll feel that not release,
},
{
    512.96,514.64
     then you can move on to a different spot
},
{
    514.64,517.32
     and you can find another area to release.
},
{
    517.32,520.32
     Okay, cool, so that's the TheraCane, you guys.
},
{
    520.32,523.52
     Again, one of my favorite self therapy tools.
},
{
    523.52,524.84
     Check the link in the description.
},
{
    524.84,525.0
     I've got a link to one of these TheraC tools. Check the link in the description.
},
{
    525.0,527.12
     I've got a link to one of these Theracanes.
},
{
    527.12,528.48
     You can pick one up on Amazon.
},
{
    528.48,529.48
     They're pretty cheap.
},
{
    529.48,530.48
     They're like 15, maybe 20 bucks.
},
{
    530.48,532.0
     So go ahead and check that out.
},
{
    532.0,535.92
     Now if you don't have the Theracane available, tennis ball works really well too.
},
{
    535.92,541.28
     She's just going to need to stand up and she can put that between her back and the wall.
},
{
    541.28,546.0
     And then again, right on that spot, she can kind of you know squat move and roll and rotate
},
{
    546.0,551.12
     to kind of get that tennis ball right on that spot where one of those muscle knots is and then
},
{
    551.12,555.84
     hold it right there same thing about 20 to 30 seconds lean into it kind of put some pressure on
},
{
    555.84,560.88
     it is a really great way a really great self mobilization technique that you can really hit
},
{
    560.88,565.44
     that muscle knot as well. Nice job baby okay. Okay, so we've got one more.
},
{
    565.44,567.84
     If I can get her off of these things.
},
{
    567.84,572.76
     So we've massaged it, we've mobilized it,
},
{
    572.76,574.22
     we've stretched it, we've shown you
},
{
    574.22,575.48
     some different things there.
},
{
    575.48,576.78
     The last thing that I love to do
},
{
    576.78,578.54
     and the last thing that I think a lot of people miss
},
{
    578.54,579.84
     when we're talking about muscle knots
},
{
    579.84,582.4
     is just strengthening the area,
},
{
    582.4,583.8
     especially between the shoulder blades.
},

     We're talking about middle traps and rhomboids. The stronger we can make those, the less they have to work throughout your day
},
{
    590.08,595.52
     and all of a sudden the more that not melts away. And so to do that, what I'll typically recommend
},
{
    595.52,600.16
     to people is just some rows. And so go ahead and grab those. I'll kind of be your anchor point right
},
{
    600.16,606.36
     here. Okay. Okay. So you would anchor this around something firmer than your husband.
},
{
    606.36,611.88
     And so a railing or a doorknob works well, something like that.
},
{
    611.88,613.72
     And so then what she's going to do, go ahead and do some rows.
},
{
    613.72,616.32
     So you're going to step back, extend your elbows all the way out straight.
},
{
    616.32,622.16
     And then what she's going to do is pull her elbows back behind her and then come forward.
},
{
    622.16,625.4
     Your emphasis with this is I really want you to fill this between
},
{
    625.4,630.6
     your shoulder blade. I don't want you to focus on pulling the handles to your armpits. I
},
{
    630.6,634.72
     want you to focus the mental picture that you should have is pulling your elbows back
},
{
    634.72,638.8
     behind your body. That's kind of the visual that I want. You should feel this between
},
{
    638.8,643.2
     the shoulder blades. Those are the muscles that we want to go crazy with this. And so
},
{
    643.2,645.76
     rows you guys about three sets of 10.
},
{
    645.76,648.08
     You can even work that up into the 20 rep range,
},
{
    648.08,650.92
     kind of three sets of 20 is another great way
},
{
    650.92,652.88
     that you're gonna really target those muscle knots
},
{
    652.88,653.88
     in your upper back.
},
{
    654.88,656.96
