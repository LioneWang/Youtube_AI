     In this video, I'm going to show you how to fix a high shoulder for good. Stay tuned.
},

    9.44,14.08
     Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe here at SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a
},
{
    14.08,19.68
     high or uneven shoulder and need a quick fix, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss.
},
{
    19.68,25.48
     I'm going to show you a three-part process that is going to help level the shoulders off.
},
{
    25.48,27.6
     And the great part is they're very easy to do.
},
{
    27.6,29.4
     All of these exercises you can do
},
{
    29.4,31.4
     in the comfort of your own home.
},
{
    31.4,33.56
     I'm going to be using two pieces of equipment.
},
{
    33.56,35.16
     The first being a racquetball
},
{
    35.16,37.08
     and the other one a therapy band.
},
{
    37.08,38.68
     Both of these I bought locally
},
{
    38.68,40.24
     at a sporting goods department.
},
{
    40.24,43.76
     I believe the total cost was under $20 combined.
},
{
    43.76,47.36
     You can also get them easily online such as at Amazon.
},
{
    47.36,49.52
     But all of these motions are very easy to do.
},
{
    49.52,50.52
     They're very safe.
},
{
    50.52,54.08
     They're very effective towards helping a high shoulder.
},
{
    54.08,57.72
     So let's get started with them and fix that high shoulder for good.
},
{
    57.72,59.52
     So I'm going to go over three parts.
},
{
    59.52,64.8
     Each part is very important to do to help get the best results for getting rid of that
},
{
    64.8,66.14
     high shoulder.
},
{
    66.14,70.66
     With the first part, we're going to focus on muscle knots and getting rid of tightness,
},
{
    70.66,73.98
     especially into a muscle called the trapezius or trap muscle.
},
{
    73.98,77.3
     The trapezius is responsible for lifting the shoulder up.
},
{
    77.3,81.6
     So if it's really tight, it can actually cause those shoulders to become uneven.
},
{
    81.6,82.8
     Let's take our racquetball.
},
{
    82.8,86.64
     I'm going to cup it like this and I'm going to go over the top portion of the shoulder,
},
{
    86.64,88.14
     the real meaty part.
},
{
    88.14,91.92
     Let's press into an area that you feel is really tight, like there's a muscle spasm
},
{
    91.92,93.36
     or muscle not going.
},
{
    93.36,99.12
     Just press in there and then just work at it for about 15 to 30 seconds or until it
},
{
    99.12,100.36
     starts to release.
},
{
    100.36,104.2
     You can do this a couple times and then just switch over different spots.
},
{
    104.2,108.0
     You want to pretty much go over the whole portion of the shoulder itself.
},
{
    108.0,111.8
     But when you do this too, you can lift up on the shoulder, you can bring it down,
},
{
    111.8,116.2
     you can kind of twirl it too, go in different ranges of motions of the shoulders
},
{
    116.2,119.8
     to activate the muscle and really target those tight spots.
},
{
    119.8,122.4
     But again, you just want to go over different spots.
},
{
    122.4,126.08
     Even if the other shoulder is not having any problems,
},
{
    126.08,128.24
     there's no reason why you can't go over there
},
{
    128.24,131.56
     and do the same thing just to keep the muscles in balance.
},
{
    131.56,133.92
     But that right there is going to help loosen everything up
},
{
    133.92,135.04
     for this next part.
},
{
    135.04,137.28
     So let's build off that first part
},
{
    137.28,139.88
     by now putting more range of motion
},
{
    139.88,142.24
     into the shoulders themselves.
},
{
    142.24,145.52
     We're going to target the upper trapezius with this stretch,
},
{
    145.52,148.68
     again the top portion of the shoulder.
},
{
    148.68,151.84
     So what I'm going to do is whatever side shoulder
},
{
    151.84,154.36
     that I'm focusing on, if this one is high,
},
{
    154.36,157.92
     let's take that side's arm and go all the way across
},
{
    157.92,160.64
     the low of the back until you can go any further.
},
{
    160.64,163.36
     At this point, you're going to feel this muscle right here
},
{
    163.36,168.4
     on the top portion start to become activated. Let's take the other arm and put it on the
},
{
    168.4,173.16
     head like this and then bend the ear towards the opposite shoulder. And when
},
{
    173.16,176.4
     you do this sometimes you will get a pop or crack into the neck that is
},
{
    176.4,180.76
     completely normal. It's just gas is being released into the neck itself. But you
},
{
    180.76,184.72
     want to keep pulling until you feel a great stretch from the neck all the way
},
{
    184.72,187.32
     down into the top of the shoulder.
},
{
    187.32,189.64
     Hold this one for 15 seconds.
},
{
    189.64,195.4
     You're just going to relax and then you're going to repeat this up to five times.
},
{
    195.4,199.96
     What this is going to do again is just loosen that trapezius muscle up here and hopefully
},
{
    199.96,204.16
     loosen it where you'll start to notice that shoulder start to be able to go down and become
},
{
    204.16,208.94
     more even. So another instigator of a high shoulder is a tight
},
{
    208.94,213.64
     levator scapula. So this one is going to focus more on the shoulder blades. If one
},
{
    213.64,217.0
     shoulder blade is you know hiked up it's going to bring that whole side up with
},
{
    217.0,220.82
     it. So this stretch is very easy. What we're going to do is whatever side we're
},
{
    220.82,224.44
     having the high shoulder let's try to bring that down as much as we can. So it's
},
{
    224.44,226.4
     like taking the hand and reaching down
},
{
    226.4,227.76
     towards the floor more or less,
},
{
    227.76,229.8
     until you feel a very good stretch.
},
{
    229.8,231.02
     Let's take our head then,
},
{
    231.02,233.12
     and then look towards the opposite direction,
},
{
    233.12,236.1
     and then look down towards the opposite armpit.
},
{
    236.1,238.0
     I'm going to take the hand on that side,
},
{
    238.0,240.04
     and then I'm going to grab the back of the head,
},
{
    240.04,243.22
     and I'm just going to pull it down towards my armpit.
},
{
    243.22,245.46
     With this, you should feel a great stretch
},
{
    245.46,248.54
     from the neck all the way down to the shoulder blade itself.
},
{
    248.54,251.08
     Only go to your comfort level.
},
{
    251.08,253.54
     Hold this for 30 seconds.
},
{
    253.54,255.52
     Relax, and then on this next one,
},
{
    255.52,257.64
     try to reach down even further
},
{
    257.64,261.24
     and put a little bit more pull downwards with the head
},
{
    261.24,263.08
     until you feel a great stretch again,
},
{
    263.08,264.88
     neck to the shoulder blade.
},
{
    264.88,265.0
     Do this five complete times. It's stretch again, neck to the shoulder blade.
},
{
    265.0,267.28
     Do this five complete times.
},
{
    267.28,269.64
     It's really going to help around those shoulder blades.
},
{
    269.64,274.72
     Just for good measure, go to the other side too, just to keep both sides in balance.
},
{
    274.72,279.48
     If we're looking to get rid of a high shoulder, we have to focus on strengthening the muscles
},
{
    279.48,282.64
     around the shoulder and shoulder blades itself.
},
{
    282.64,289.9
     That way we have a stronger support system. So what I'm going to start off with is what is known as a scapular push-up.
},
{
    289.9,294.34
     It's going to help bring the shoulder blade down on the high side. Let's sit
},
{
    294.34,298.78
     on the floor, legs straight. I'm going to take a rolled up bath towel and put it
},
{
    298.78,303.22
     off to the side of the high shoulder. Let's take our hands and place the high
},
{
    303.22,309.36
     side's hand over the towel. The other one just goes on the floor. What I'm going to do is I'm going to use my
},
{
    309.36,313.7
     upper body weight to press downwards into my hand. So it should feel like all
},
{
    313.7,318.1
     of my weight is going into my palms right here. When you do this try to press
},
{
    318.1,322.86
     down into the towel as much as you're able to. You should feel the shoulder
},
{
    322.86,329.6
     blade muscles on the high side really start to fire. Only go to your comfort level. Hold this for 30
},
{
    329.6,334.22
     seconds. You're just going to relax then and then you're going to repeat this up
},
{
    334.22,339.14
     to five times. It's just a great way to build strength to press down and
},
{
    339.14,343.64
     hopefully bring everything down with it including the shoulder and the shoulder
},
{
    343.64,345.16
     blade itself. Give that one a try.
},
{
    345.2,348.92
     This next exercise for a high shoulder,
},
{
    349.16,352.2
     I like to do this one at the edge of a bed.
},
{
    352.22,356.8
     I'm going to position myself where I'm laying on my stomach and from the elbows
},
{
    356.8,359.76
     down are going to be able to hang off the bed itself.
},
{
    359.96,360.64
     From here,
},
{
    360.64,363.92
     what I'm going to do is lift my arms up as much as I can.
},
{
    363.96,369.28
     When you do this, you're going to feel the upper back and the shoulder blade region start
},
{
    369.28,371.52
     to tighten up and contract.
},
{
    371.52,374.64
     Hold this for about 10 to 15 seconds.
},
{
    374.64,378.72
     You're just going to relax, and then you're going to do this again.
},
{
    378.72,382.84
     Try to bring them up a little bit further and do this three complete times.
},
{
    382.84,385.08
     The second part of this, and this is how we're going to
},
{
    385.08,388.36
     target that high shoulder, is go back into that position
},
{
    388.36,390.64
     of lifting the arms up, but let's try to bring the
},
{
    390.64,394.02
     shoulder blade on that side down as much as we're able to
},
{
    394.02,395.68
     while we lift the arms up.
},
{
    395.68,398.52
     You're really going to feel a very good amount of
},
{
    398.52,401.24
     contraction in and around the shoulder and shoulder blade
},
{
    401.24,402.08
     region.
},
{
    402.08,404.72
     Hold this up to 30 seconds if you're able to.
},
{
    404.72,408.72
     You're just going to relax, you're going to then repeat, try to bring that shoulder
},
{
    408.72,413.12
     blade down just a little bit further if you're able to, and then do that five
},
{
    413.12,419.36
     complete times. Great exercise. So this next exercise is probably my favorite for
},
{
    419.36,423.94
     a high or uneven shoulder. What I'm going to do is sit in a chair with good
},
{
    423.94,425.2
     upright posture. I'm going to take my therapy band, I'm going to do is sit in a chair with good upright posture.
},
{
    425.2,430.0
     I'm going to take my therapy band, I'm going to place it underneath my feet just like this.
},
{
    430.0,435.6
     Let's crisscross the arms and grab the ends right here where my palms are going to be
},
{
    435.6,441.2
     facing down towards the floor. Put our knees together and with this movement I'm going to try
},
{
    441.2,445.64
     to engage through my shoulder blades while lifting up
},
{
    445.64,450.0
     straight with my arms. Do not try to shrug the shoulders with this. It should
},
{
    450.0,453.72
     feel like you really have a good amount of control through the shoulder blades
},
{
    453.72,459.62
     and firing those muscles. Keep lifting up as far as you're able to go. Hold this
},
{
    459.62,465.44
     for about 10 seconds. You're just going to relax and then you're going to try to do this
},
{
    465.44,468.22
     for 10 complete repetitions.
},
{
    468.22,473.56
     This is a great exercise because it's going to fire and work on so many muscles that are
},
{
    473.56,478.98
     responsible for keeping the shoulders healthy and in balance.
