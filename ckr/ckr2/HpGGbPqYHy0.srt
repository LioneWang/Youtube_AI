     Nothing beats a spot of football in the park.
},
{
    2.68,4.44
     Fresh air, aerobic exercise,
},
{
    4.52,8.12
     and of course, the chance to show off those silky football skills,
},
{
    8.2,9.68
     like the stepover,
},
{
    11.28,12.84
     or the cry of turn,
},
{
    15.04,16.6
     or the rainbow flick.
},
{
    18.24,21.0
     But football can also be dangerous.
},
{
    28.76,32.9
     You could turn sharply and twist an ankle. I don't think so Chris. Well, well you could injure yourself if someone tackled you. Very unlikely in my
},
{
    32.9,37.7
     case. You could break your fifth metatarsal kicking the ball too hard. My
},
{
    37.7,41.84
     metatarsals are as hard as tough and steel. Alright, well look just be careful
},
{
    41.84,48.4
     when we're playing. Now, Zondi, on me, Edson!
},
{
    50.8,53.24
     That manoeuvre's known as the Chris Clonk, but it's also an injury alert.
},
{
    53.24,56.84
     Wow! Chris is very good at pretending to be knocked out, isn't he?
},
{
    60.28,64.36
     So, what should you do if you think someone is unconscious and breathing?
},
{
    70.28,74.48
     A, tip their head back, check they are breathing and roll them onto their side. B, shout, wakey, wakey, really loudly.
},
{
    74.48,79.8
     Or C, lie down next to them and have us sleep, enjoying the peace and quiet.
},
{
    79.8,86.0
     The answer is A, tip their head back, check their breathing, and roll them onto their side.
},
{
    86.0,89.0
     First thing we want to do is check if he's breathing.
},
{
    89.0,92.0
     We tilt his head back a little bit so his airway's open.
},
{
    92.0,94.0
     Then Hannah listens. I can feel his breath on my ear
},
{
    94.0,96.0
     and I can see his chest breathing,
},
{
    96.0,98.0
     so we definitely know he's breathing.
},
{
    98.0,100.0
     So now we need to roll him onto his side
},
{
    100.0,102.0
     so we get his leg up here,
},
{
    102.0,104.0
     get his arm over here,
},
{
    104.0,107.92
     and then we can pull him this way.
},
{
    107.92,111.24
     And then we can use this hand to support his head.
},
{
    111.24,113.24
     And now if he's sick, it goes on the ground.
},
{
    113.24,114.56
     His tongue is going to fall forward,
},
{
    114.56,115.84
     so it won't stop him breathing.
},
{
    115.84,116.84
     And we can go and get help.
},
{
    116.84,118.04
     This is nice and safe.
},
{
    118.04,119.32
     Who wants to have a go?
},
{
    119.32,120.32
     Me!
},
{
    125.0,129.0
     Remember, never do this on your own unless it is an emergency.
},
{
    129.0,131.0
     It's always best to find an adult.
},
{
    131.0,133.0
     Check if she's breathing.
},
{
    133.0,135.0
     Well done, girls.
},
{
    135.0,137.0
     Yeah, he's breathing.
},
{
    137.0,140.0
     Next, get them into the recovery position.
},
{
    140.0,142.0
     And then what's the final thing we've got to do?
},
{
    142.0,144.0
     Check if she's breathing.
},
{
    144.0,145.96
     That's good. So you have a good old listen, good old look,
},
{
    145.96,147.8
     and she's still breathing.
},
{
    147.8,150.2
     So if someone has been knocked unconscious
},
{
    150.2,152.52
     and they're breathing, tip their head back,
},
{
    152.52,155.64
     roll them onto one side, and find an adult.
},
{
    155.64,157.16
     Do you want to see my new football trick?
},
{
    157.16,159.84
     It's called the Zarn Loop Lift and Dive.
},
{
    159.84,161.76
     Let me think about that for a second.
},
{
    161.76,None
     No!
},
