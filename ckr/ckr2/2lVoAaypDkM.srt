     Bob and Brad, the two most famous physical therapists
},
{
    6.72,8.04
     on the internet.
},
{
    11.76,13.56
     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.
},
{
    13.56,14.9
     Brad Heineck, physical therapist.
},
{
    14.9,16.16
     We're gonna be on the most famous physical therapists
},
{
    16.16,17.0
     on the internet.
},
{
    17.0,18.16
     In our opinion, of course, Bob.
},
{
    18.16,19.0
     I'm Johnny Carson.
},
{
    19.0,20.9
     We used to have that staff in a colleague.
},
{
    20.9,21.74
     Nevermind.
},
{
    21.74,24.92
     Today we're gonna talk about hand weakness after stroke.
},
{
    24.92,27.84
     This is the single most important thing to do
},
{
    27.84,29.72
     to regain motion.
},
{
    29.72,31.84
     So we'll reveal this in the video, Brad.
},
{
    31.84,33.36

},
{
    43.3,44.56
     What are we giving away this week?
},
{
    44.56,46.18
     We're giving away the Fit Glide.
},
{
    46.18,49.78
     This is actually would be very helpful after stroke too,
},
{
    49.78,51.54
     especially if you had your legs affected.
},
{
    51.54,53.5
     Right, yeah, you don't use it on the table.
},
{
    53.5,55.34
     Right, right, it's on the floor.
},
{
    55.34,57.5
     You can also find the contest,
},
{
    57.5,59.78
     it'll be pinned to the top of the page at Facebook.
},
{
    59.78,61.5
     Go to Twitter, Instagram, or TikTok
},
{
    61.5,64.38
     if you want a 60 second version of Bob or Brad.
},
{
    64.38,69.04
     So after stroke, many, many experienced weakness,
},
{
    69.04,73.32
     especially in the hand, hand and wrist.
},
{
    73.32,77.04
     You know, and Brad and I aren't real experts on that
},
{
    77.04,79.48
     because if you understand physical therapy
},
{
    79.48,82.44
     and occupational therapy, a lot of times the occupational
},
{
    82.44,85.24
     therapist spend more time on the wrist and hand.
},
{
    85.24,88.72
     But I've worked with patients who had stroke long enough
},
{
    88.72,91.44
     that I know very well the common pattern.
},
{
    91.44,96.44
     And so you're trying to regain motion and strength
},
{
    96.44,99.68
     in the wrist and hand through two means generally.
},
{
    99.68,103.7
     One, after a stroke there's swelling in the brain.
},
{
    103.7,105.94
     And as that starts to go down,
},
{
    105.94,108.48
     some of your function returns.
},
{
    108.48,111.48
     Some of the connections are remade.
},
{
    111.48,112.8
     Yep, they come the pathways
},
{
    112.8,114.68
     and as that improves, they improve
},
{
    114.68,117.08
     and boy, it's fun to see that gains.
},
{
    117.08,118.16
     However.
},
{
    118.16,120.2
     Well, the other way that you can make a gain
},
{
    120.2,123.6
     is you actually, the brain forms new connections.
},
{
    123.6,126.92
     And the ability to do this is called neuroplasticity.
},
{
    126.92,131.24
     And to be honest, it's just like a lot of things.
},
{
    131.24,133.02
     With a younger brain,
},
{
    133.02,134.96
     you see the connections form easier.
},
{
    134.96,137.88
     And I remember having a person,
},
{
    137.88,139.72
     this was really quite tragic.
},
{
    139.72,142.12
     He was only in his 40s, and he had a stroke.
},
{
    142.12,146.52
     But he recovered so well because he was younger.
},
{
    146.52,147.36
     Yeah.
},
{
    147.36,149.76
     Things just, the nature of the human body.
},
{
    149.76,150.84
     When you get to be our age,
},
{
    150.84,153.08
     you can call someone for 40 years old young.
},
{
    153.08,157.28
     So neuroplasticity helps reestablish the communication
},
{
    157.28,161.56
     between the injured parts of the brain and the body.
},
{
    161.56,164.76
     So you're reestablishing connections.
},
{
    164.76,168.2
     The process, it's the process that enables stroke survivors
},
{
    168.2,170.52
     to regain motor function in the hands
},
{
    170.52,172.36
     and other parts of the body.
},
{
    172.36,177.36
     So for this to happen, for this to work the best,
},
{
    178.28,180.88
     I'm gonna give you three words, repetition,
},
{
    180.88,182.76
     repetition, repetition.
},
{
    182.76,184.64
     In other words, repetition.
},
{
    184.64,186.6
     Yeah, in other words, repetition.
},
{
    186.6,189.6
     If you do that, that's what's gonna help
},
{
    189.6,191.76
     reestablish those connections the best.
},
{
    191.76,193.8
     Yeah, you just gotta keep on going.
},
{
    193.8,197.92
     And that's where it's nice to have support at home
},
{
    197.92,200.72
     or the therapist is the cheerleader.
},
{
    200.72,202.4
     Let's keep doing it.
},
{
    202.4,205.92
     And then once you see things to gain it, it's worth it.
},
{
    205.92,206.76
     It's really-
},
{
    206.76,210.64
     Well, for me, I think if you make it a part of your routine,
},
{
    210.64,212.4
     that's where it becomes repetition.
},
{
    212.4,213.8
     You know what I mean?
},
{
    213.8,216.04
     So that's why, I don't know if you've ever heard
},
{
    216.04,219.0
     of constraint induced movement therapy.
},
{
    219.0,221.4
     That's a type of therapy where they actually
},
{
    221.4,224.84
     constrain your good arm, your non-involved arm,
},
{
    224.84,228.88
     and they make you use the involved arm,
},
{
    228.88,229.72
     involve them.
},
{
    229.72,231.52
     Particularly with a stroke,
},
{
    231.52,235.48
     what can happen is the mind will actually ignore that
},
{
    235.48,237.44
     without the person being aware of it.
},
{
    237.44,240.28
     So they just start using the good side.
},
{
    240.28,244.16
     So you have to actually force it by constraining
},
{
    244.16,246.84
     or however you may do it to use a good leg,
},
{
    246.84,249.0
     the injured leg or the injured hand.
},
{
    249.0,249.84
     Exactly.
},
{
    249.84,252.3
     So that's not what this video is about.
},
{
    252.3,254.48
     I'm gonna, at the end of this video,
},
{
    254.48,256.44
     this is gonna be a fairly long video, by the way, Brad.
},
{
    256.44,258.2
     I'm gonna warn him right up front.
},
{
    258.2,261.4
     I'm gonna show you some exercises you can do
},
{
    261.4,266.26
     for a hand and wrist that actually have virtually no movement.
},
{
    266.26,268.06
     What I wanna talk about now
},
{
    268.06,269.78
     is if you have some movement.
},
{
    269.78,273.26
     Say you have, typically this is what I've seen Brad,
},
{
    273.26,276.3
     again, working with a lot of patients who have had stroke.
},
{
    276.3,278.4
     You see some finger flexion,
},
{
    278.4,280.74
     that's one of the first things that come back,
},
{
    280.74,282.98
     and a lot of times wrist flexion too.
},
{
    282.98,287.76
     But what tends to lag is extending the fingers
},
{
    287.76,289.48
     and extending the wrist.
},
{
    289.48,292.2
     And this is just the way the body is connected.
},
{
    292.2,294.16
     They got synergies as called.
},
{
    294.16,296.04
     And you don't really need to know all that.
},
{
    296.04,296.88
     It's complicated.
},
{
    296.88,298.32
     Right, it's very complicated.
},
{
    298.32,299.36
     We'll make it easy for you.
},
{
    299.36,302.04
     So this is what I'm gonna talk about now
},
{
    302.04,303.0
     works really well for you.
},
{
    303.0,305.94
     If you have just a slight amount of a spasticity,
},
{
    305.94,307.58
     spasticity or tone.
},
{
    307.58,310.22
     If you have a lot, let's say really your hand
},
{
    310.22,311.94
     is really curling up,
},
{
    311.94,313.88
     then this, we're gonna be talking about this product
},
{
    313.88,316.04
     by the way, this product is not for you.
},
{
    316.04,318.46
     This is called Disable Glove.
},
{
    318.46,321.0
     We'll have a link below so you can see it.
},
{
    321.0,323.94
     We have no connection to these people at all.
},
{
    323.94,327.14
     They just, I've seen their stuff, they make good stuff.
},
{
    327.14,332.14
     I wanted our subscribers to be able to see these products.
},
{
    332.44,334.9
     Right, so if you've got a hand that's not opening,
},
{
    334.9,338.3
     you have that, but there's some motion in there,
},
{
    338.3,340.54
     and you're wondering, is there anything out there for it?
},
{
    340.54,341.98
     This may be an answer for you.
},
{
    341.98,342.82
     This may be an answer.
},
{
    342.82,346.48
     Again, a Sable Glove, if you have real tightness,
},
{
    346.48,350.0
     then you would call, use what is called the Sable Flex.
},
{
    350.0,352.0
     And again, we'll have their website link before you,
},
{
    352.0,354.42
     low so you can, they have lots of information
},
{
    354.42,355.26
     on the website.
},
{
    355.26,356.72
     I think you can even contact them.
},
{
    356.72,359.46
     They're very good, very good service.
},
{
    359.46,361.84
     So again, we're not paid by them.
},
{
    361.84,364.0
     I wanna make sure that's clear.
},
{
    364.0,367.02
     So this is the Sable Glove.
},
{
    367.02,369.94
     They have a couple of videos on their channel
},
{
    369.94,371.64
     what they showed before and after.
},
{
    371.64,373.18
     They showed two patients.
},
{
    373.18,376.22
     And the patient before was like this
},
{
    376.22,377.68
     and they had no wrist extension
},
{
    377.68,379.34
     and they had no finger extension.
},
{
    379.34,381.3
     And they were trying to pick up an object
},
{
    381.3,383.18
     and it was very difficult.
},
{
    383.18,384.9
     They put the glove on
},
{
    384.9,387.36
     and they could then pick up objects
},
{
    387.36,389.52
     quite easily to be honest with you.
},
{
    389.52,391.16
     It's got nice rubber grips in here too.
},
{
    391.16,392.0
     You know what I'm saying?
},
{
    392.0,392.84
     Yeah, it does, yep.
},
{
    392.84,394.12
     Little grippy things on there.
},
{
    394.12,396.64
     And you know, you probably cannot see it
},
{
    396.64,398.6
     from this distance because it's black on black,
},
{
    398.6,400.64
     but there are rubber-
},
{
    400.64,401.64
     They call them tensioners.
},
{
    401.64,406.24
     Tensioners that help extend the fingers at each joint,
},
{
    406.24,408.88
     as well as at the primary knuckle joint.
},
{
    408.88,413.12
     And so you can vary each finger or thumb
},
{
    413.12,414.08
     the resistance needed,
},
{
    414.08,415.82
     because sometimes it's very common
},
{
    415.82,418.32
     that some fingers are stronger than the others.
},
{
    418.32,421.56
     So you can custom it per that patient,
},
{
    421.56,422.4
     or per, per, per hand.
},
{
    422.4,424.76
     Yeah, if you had even a nerve injury, Brad.
},
{
    424.76,425.6
     Sure. You know, that affected maybe the ul, per, per hand. If you had even a nerve injury, Brad. Sure.
},
{
    425.6,428.16
     You know, that affected maybe the ulnar side more.
},
{
    428.16,429.0
     Yep.
},
{
    429.0,431.6
     You could hook those up and you could leave these unhooked up.
},
{
    431.6,434.28
     Yeah, say those are normal and you just want to work
},
{
    434.28,436.24
     to, you know, the fourth and fifth digits.
},
{
    436.24,439.34
     So it's very clever and what this goes back
},
{
    439.34,442.64
     to our title again, now with this in place,
},
{
    442.64,445.0
     you can use it throughout the day,
},
{
    445.0,447.42
     repetition, repetition, repetition.
},
{
    447.42,450.0
     As it gets stronger, you can go ahead
},
{
    450.0,453.82
     and take some of the bands that the tensioner's off.
},
{
    453.82,456.24
     Now if you have no strength at all,
},
{
    456.24,458.92
     sometimes they use electrical stimulation with this.
},
{
    458.92,461.72
     They actually do that right along with it.
},
{
    461.72,463.28
     And that's something the therapist will need
},
{
    463.28,464.12
     to help you with.
},
{
    464.12,468.52
     They've got measurements, so like to fit your hand.
},
{
    468.52,469.36
     Sure.
},
{
    469.36,473.48
     So, fairly easy to put on, but I would say
},
{
    473.48,475.04
     you might need help.
},
{
    475.04,478.28
     It all depends on the level of weakness
},
{
    478.28,479.64
     that you have with your hand.
},
{
    479.64,480.48
     Right.
},
{
    480.48,481.96
     But I've been wearing this here
},
{
    481.96,483.92
     for probably 10 or 15 minutes now.
},
{
    483.92,486.02
     It's very comfortable. I'm impressed with it
},
{
    486.08,493.04
     So are you the terminator or if we want to go really old school will go to the six million dollar man, right?
},
{
    493.04,497.04
     Oh, yeah, so leave majors leave majors and we were talking about it
},
{
    497.04,502.68
     He was married to Farrah Fawcett. I think or dating her at least but so we want to get something for everybody
},
{
    502.68,506.84
     We got the terminator, which is you're a little bit older,
},
{
    506.84,508.72
     but if you're with the six million dollar hand.
},
{
    508.72,510.2
     We better get back to treatment.
},
{
    510.2,514.36
     All right, so I think that's all I need to say
},
{
    514.36,515.2
     about the glove.
},
{
    515.2,517.36
     I mean, if you're interested in that, fairly expensive,
},
{
    517.36,521.08
     but I think it's worthwhile if you have had a stroke
},
{
    521.08,523.04
     or some other neurological injury.
},
{
    523.04,529.06
     Right, and that's what you're having, difficulty opening, but you still have some clothes.
},
{
    529.06,531.78
     And it's one of those things that you could ask your
},
{
    531.78,533.82
     therapist, if you've hopefully had a therapist,
},
{
    533.82,535.34
     maybe you could refer back to.
},
{
    536.32,540.98
     So yeah, we don't promote products unless we really think
},
{
    540.98,541.98
     they're a good quality.
},
{
    541.98,543.82
     Yeah, exactly.
},
{
    543.82,545.8
     So now I'm gonna show five exercises, Brad,
},
{
    545.8,550.2
     that you can do without any product,
},
{
    550.2,553.32
     without, you know, you can start these right away.
},
{
    553.32,554.84
     So we're gonna start with,
},
{
    554.84,557.32
     let's say this is my involved hand.
},
{
    557.32,559.92
     I'm gonna put that hand flat on the table,
},
{
    559.92,563.12
     or if you have a slippery table, or a towel.
},
{
    563.12,565.44
     Now, this is just simple.
},
{
    565.44,569.0
     I'm doing all-neuromady deviations, is all I'm doing.
},
{
    569.0,571.84
     Now, let's say you have no strength.
},
{
    571.84,572.8
     You know what?
},
{
    572.8,574.92
     You can use the other one to help you.
},
{
    574.92,575.76
     You know what I mean?
},
{
    575.76,580.76
     But the key is, you use this as less, at least as possible.
},
{
    581.7,584.48
     So you wanna try to do it on your own.
},
{
    585.52,588.0
     I actually think I'd slide better on the table, Brad.
},
{
    588.0,590.44
     And that might be the case depending on your surface.
},
{
    590.44,591.52
     Sure.
},
{
    591.52,593.8
     But if there's nothing there,
},
{
    593.8,595.8
     I'm gonna go ahead and there might even be
},
{
    595.8,597.16
     a little flexion like this.
},
{
    597.16,598.36
     I'm gonna go ahead and push it down.
},
{
    598.36,601.2
     And I'm gonna start working back and forth.
},
{
    601.2,603.36
     And just to contact the other hand,
},
{
    603.36,608.08
     sometimes well, and the help will help turn those muscles on.
},
{
    609.16,610.56
     Yeah, or make that connection.
},
{
    610.56,611.68
     Right, so.
},
{
    611.68,614.44
     It's very, I've found it very useful
},
{
    614.44,617.96
     just to make contact particularly with the muscles
},
{
    617.96,619.44
     that are going and so.
},
{
    619.44,622.28
     Yep, so now we're gonna work on wrist flexion
},
{
    622.28,623.16
     and extension.
},
{
    623.16,626.48
     So again, we put it on the towel or on the table.
},
{
    626.48,628.4
     Again, I find the table is much better.
},
{
    628.4,630.24
     This is a very slippery table.
},
{
    630.24,632.28
     Thumb up like this.
},
{
    632.28,633.76
     And you're gonna just go back and forth.
},
{
    633.76,636.08
     Now you can clasp your hands like this too.
},
{
    636.08,638.68
     And just go back and forth like this.
},
{
    638.68,640.56
     Could you do it not on the table too?
},
{
    640.56,641.76
     Yep, absolutely.
},
{
    641.76,642.84
     You can do it at the table.
},
{
    642.84,647.84
     If you are able to tolerate a little bit of gravity,
},
{
    648.08,649.4
     you got some strength going on,
},
{
    649.4,651.76
     you can actually go this way.
},
{
    651.76,653.56
     And you can actually go this way.
},
{
    653.56,655.52
     Can you see that pretty good, Liz?
},
{
    655.52,657.12
     Okay.
},
{
    657.12,658.96
     All right, same thing.
},
{
    658.96,660.44
     We're next one now.
},
{
    660.44,661.28
     Thumb up.
},
{
    661.28,663.56
     Again, I'll do at least 10 repetitions on each one of these.
},
{
    663.56,665.96
     Now we're gonna do supination and pronation.
},
{
    665.96,670.72
     And again, you can use the other arm
},
{
    670.72,672.2
     to try to help move it along.
},
{
    672.2,674.84
     This is where you wanna keep this elbow
},
{
    674.84,677.4
     to the table if you can so that it isolates that motion.
},
{
    677.4,678.92
     Yeah, you're not going like this.
},
{
    678.92,680.12
     Right, exactly.
},
{
    680.12,681.76
     You're just actually going,
},
{
    681.76,683.52
     rolling it back and forth like that.
},
{
    683.52,687.14
     Yeah, really focuses on that elbow and forearm.
},
{
    687.14,689.84
     With all of these, you don't, you're not forcing, you know,
},
{
    689.84,694.84
     I mean, but again, using this arm as little as possible.
},
{
    695.6,698.02
     The last one, very simple.
},
{
    698.02,699.34
     You're actually, this one is one
},
{
    699.34,701.3
     where you do need a wash cloth.
},
{
    701.3,703.3
     Well, maybe can this work.
},
{
    703.3,707.52
     You wanna, you're just gonna grip closed and open like that.
},
{
    707.52,710.76
     And as you open, again, that's the one that tends
},
{
    710.76,712.8
     to be the most difficult for people,
},
{
    712.8,715.6
     you might have to push down a little bit like that.
},
{
    715.6,717.32
     This is one of those things that you could use
},
{
    717.32,720.16
     just for a visual, you can, you can-
},
{
    720.16,721.64
     Yeah, you can see it, curly knot.
},
{
    721.64,723.8
     Yeah, you get it there.
},
{
    723.8,726.44
     So the goal, get the whole towel into that fist
},
{
    726.44,728.68
     and then you would have that repetition done.
},
{
    728.68,731.2
     And then you try to extend back out again.
},
{
    731.2,732.44
     Yeah, yeah, there you go.
},
{
    732.44,737.0
     It just gives you something to look at, a visual, a goal.
},
{
    737.0,738.76
     It can be helpful sometimes.
},
{
    738.76,741.08
     So it is fairly simple.
},
{
    741.08,743.36
     There's only five to do.
},
{
    743.36,745.76
     This is something, again, we're talking about repetitions.
},
{
    745.76,748.36
     So you wanna do it multiple times a day.
},
{
    748.36,751.84
     You know, when you're watching TV or whatever,
},
{
    751.84,754.34
     you can just even start, you know,
},
{
    754.34,757.32
     just do it absentmindedly, almost.
},
{
    757.32,759.64
     Sure, yeah, once you get good enough at it.
},
{
    759.64,761.2
     Once you know all the exercises.
},
{
    761.2,762.48
     Right.
},
{
    762.48,765.6
     All right, again, we'll put the link below for Sabo,
},
{
    765.6,769.2
     good company, and Brad and I can fix this about anything.
},
{
    769.2,770.36
     Except for-
},
{
    770.36,771.2
     A broken heart.
},
{
    771.2,772.04
     There you go, Bob.
},
{
    772.04,772.88
     But we're working on it.
},
{
    772.88,775.4
     We will continue to work on it.
},
{
    775.4,None
     Oh yes. you
},
