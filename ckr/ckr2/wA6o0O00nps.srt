     Hello, my name is Young Kwok and I'm a primary care internist and a recreational runner at
},
{
    6.84,8.76
     the University of Michigan.
},
{
    8.76,15.16
     This is Anthony Pariano who is a marathon runner and also coach of the Huron High School
},
{
    15.16,17.04
     Cross Country Team.
},
{
    17.04,21.12
     We are here today to talk to you about knee pain.
},
{
    21.12,25.32
     Specifically we want to talk to you about knee pain on the side of the knee
},
{
    25.32,31.92
     or lateral knee pain on the outside of the knee. Now the first thing to figure
},
{
    31.92,36.68
     out when you're dealing with lateral knee pain is whether it's above or below
},
{
    36.68,43.68
     the joint line. The knee is a hinge joint where the thigh bone meets the leg bone
},
{
    43.68,46.8
     and the joint line is where the two bones
},
{
    46.8,48.4
     actually meet.
},
{
    48.4,53.16
     So let me demonstrate that on Coach Pariano.
},
{
    53.16,58.96
     So the way you can tell where the joint line is is here is the kneecap and right near the
},
{
    58.96,63.96
     bottom of the kneecap is where the bones meet if you're in this seated position and that's
},
{
    63.96,65.0
     where the joint meet if you're in this seated position, and that's where the joint line is.
},
{
    65.0,72.0
     Now, if you're having pain above the joint line on the outside of the knee, by far the most common cause of that
},
{
    72.0,79.0
     is going to be iliotibial band friction syndrome, which I'm sure many runners have heard of.
},
{
    79.0,86.4
     The iliotibial band is a thick fibrous band that runs from the hip or ilium all the way
},
{
    86.4,92.7
     down the side down to the leg bone or tibia, hence it's called the iliotibial band, and
},
{
    92.7,99.52
     as it goes over this region here, it tends to rub on the thigh bone, the bottom part
},
{
    99.52,107.04
     of the thigh bone called the femur, and cause friction and cause pain in this particular spot.
},
{
    107.04,112.92
     If a runner develops this during a run, the best thing to do is stretch this for the iliotubial
},
{
    112.92,119.0
     band so that it's not as tight and it does not cause as much rubbing.
},
{
    119.0,126.32
     But today we are going to focus on cause of joint pain below the knee joint, especially in this particular
},
{
    126.32,128.34
     spot here.
},
{
    128.34,133.4
     This is one area that really hasn't been commented on much, but I do believe is a common cause
},
{
    133.4,135.58
     of knee pain in runners.
},
{
    135.58,141.84
     This particular spot is significant because this is where the big muscle in the leg, called
},
{
    141.84,147.2
     the tibialis anterior muscle attaches and this muscle is responsible
},
{
    147.2,153.12
     for flexing the ankle upward. And you can see the muscle contracting as the ankle is
},
{
    153.12,160.48
     flexed upward. This is very similar in structure and function to the muscle in the forearm
},
{
    160.48,168.32
     here, which can cause tennis elbow if the forearm is overused.
},
{
    168.32,175.4
     During the typical course of a run, this muscle contracts thousands of times and can develop
},
{
    175.4,179.68
     tendonitis below the knee joint or in this spot.
},
{
    179.68,188.7
     Now if you are a runner and you have developed pain in this spot below the knee joint, I have adapted a very successful exercise
},
{
    188.7,192.1
     that was adapted for tennis elbow to treat tendonitis
},
{
    192.1,196.7
     in this particular spot. And Coach Pariano will kindly demonstrate that exercise.
},
{
    196.7,200.26
     It involves three simple steps. Any
},
{
    200.26,204.14
     elastic band is useful for this exercise.
},
{
    204.14,210.0
     First, cross your injured leg over, as Coach Pariano is doing, and place the elastic band
},
{
    210.0,212.6
     over the ball of the foot, that's step one.
},
{
    212.6,218.08
     And then under tension, straighten the leg with the ankle bent backwards, that's step
},
{
    218.08,219.08
     two.
},
{
    219.08,222.92
     And finally, step three is push down on the gas pedal.
},
{
    222.92,225.92
     And then repeat those three steps 15 times,
},
{
    225.92,229.76
     three times a day. And I have found that this
},
{
    229.76,233.96
     was very effective in getting rid of this particular tendonitis
},
{
    233.96,235.88
     or pain below the knee joint.
},
