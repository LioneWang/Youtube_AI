     Bob and Brad, the two most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    10.64,16.0
     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist, Brad Heineck, physical therapist, we are the most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    16.0,20.8
     In our opinion, of course, Bob, we're going to show you how to fix knee pain in seconds and this does work
},
{
    21.12,25.56
     We all know that you know when you get pain and my wife was a good example of this
},
{
    25.64,31.24
     You don't have time for this. I mean, I remember an office manager too was having knee pain
},
{
    31.24,36.52
     She's like I don't have time for this. Right. It's like so we're gonna show you stuff that you can do throughout the day
},
{
    36.52,40.4
     It doesn't take very long seconds and hopefully it'll give you some relief
},
{
    40.4,48.56
     Right now this isn't knee pain like if you fell down on a cream No, not traumatic pain, right this is a knee pain that comes for no apparent reason
},
{
    48.56,53.22
     It hurts when you stand up or when you walk and you're kind of wondering what's going on with it
},
{
    53.22,55.22
     Very common as you get older
},
{
    55.3,61.12
     You might be in your 40s and 50s and all of a sudden knee pain just shows up and that could be the cartilage
},
{
    61.12,65.84
     Just kind of deteriorating on you, Right the aging process is starting to catch up
},
{
    66.56,71.72

{
    75.12,80.92
     I'm not sure when this video is uploading, but at some point I mean when this when you want to go to the Facebook
},
{
    81.48,86.24
     Oh, yeah Bob and Brad because we're giving away something.
},
{
    86.24,88.12
     When this video comes up, I don't know what it's going
},
{
    88.12,91.8
     to be at this time, because this might be in the future.
},
{
    91.8,93.48
     We're going to be giving away something big.
},
{
    93.48,95.92
     So go to Facebook, and we'll also probably
},
{
    95.92,97.72
     have it listed in our description.
},
{
    97.72,99.32
     Right, not just like shoelaces.
},
{
    99.32,100.84
     This is something much better.
},
{
    100.84,102.96
     I mean, to give you an example, the first week,
},
{
    102.96,104.76
     we're giving away a mattress.
},
{
    104.76,107.24
     But that might be done already by the time this comes up
},
{
    107.24,110.6
     That's how it works. That's how it works
},
{
    110.6,116.62
     Yeah, all right the first thing you want to do when you get knee pain and this is almost universal in most instances
},
{
    116.76,121.04
     You want to try to decrease the weight on the knee and to do that
},
{
    121.52,125.4
     Especially if it's fairly severe pain you probably want to just for a while
},
{
    125.92,130.82
     Maybe use a crutch or a cane. My wife was completely
},
{
    132.08,133.58
     resistant to this
},
{
    133.58,139.02
     As many people are. Yeah, until she got so bad that she was forced to. In fact,
},
{
    139.3,142.58
     I don't know if this is the crutch she used but she used these padding
},
{
    142.86,145.22
     Because one thing when you use a crutch a lot
},
{
    151.22,152.34
     It's amazing how sore underneath your arms gets right so we actually bought you can get these crutch pads and
},
{
    159.56,160.24
     So she went around with just one crutch like this which was better than a cane to her because a cane really denotes that you're old
},
{
    165.04,168.68
     But this you know you're gonna have to answer a lot of questions because people are going what happened to your knee? Right, right, but if nothing else if you can at least do it at home, sure
},
{
    168.84,175.2
     So get some weight off while you're just less irritation and just we've got some good videos on this
},
{
    175.2,180.56
     But if it's your left knee you're gonna use the crutch or the cane in your right hand
},
{
    180.56,184.56
     Yeah, because the crutch is there when the leg's out there, right
},
{
    184.22,189.94
     Yeah, because the crutch is there when the leg's out there Right, the other thing is let's say you say there's no way we're listening to you Bob and Brad
},
{
    190.14,191.16
     but
},
{
    191.16,196.7
     What you can another way to decrease weight on the knee is by avoiding stairs and avoiding hills
},
{
    196.7,202.34
     I mean those things you can often do you can take the elevator for a while or if there's one or so
},
{
    202.54,205.36
     So all those things increase stress on the knee
},
{
    205.36,209.48
     so while you're getting it, we're trying to get it to calm down. A lot of times
},
{
    209.48,213.36
     if it calms down it stays calm down. Alright next thing you're gonna want to
},
{
    213.36,217.8
     regain movement. A lot of people, especially as you get older, there might be a
},
{
    217.8,222.72
     lack of motion. You might have either a lack of flexion in the knee. Let me show
},
{
    222.72,225.16
     you what that looks like. So if you're laying
},
{
    225.16,229.84
     down you can kind of compare one knee to the other and see how well it bends or
},
{
    229.84,234.92
     you can do it with a sitting two and if you find one that doesn't go as far and
},
{
    234.92,238.68
     that's the painful one you're gonna want to try to restore that that flexion
},
{
    238.68,242.88
     and I'm gonna show you one way right now to do that. So what you can do is you can
},
{
    242.88,249.62
     go on to a chair like this let's say this is my painful knee and it's lacking flexion. So I'm gonna put it up like this
},
{
    249.62,255.12
     and you can first start just even doing gentle rocking back and forth like this just to get a
},
{
    255.12,260.64
     little more flexion. You're trying to avoid pain, I don't want you to go into where you really get
},
{
    260.64,265.64
     sharp pain, you can have a little bump into the pain you can get a little bit of pain
},
{
    272.28,275.28
     Then you're gonna actually try this movement here. You're gonna actually grab the lower bone here the tibia and the fibula There's two bones down here and you're gonna turn them
},
{
    275.52,279.96
     You're gonna turn them towards the other leg. So if I'm on my right leg
},
{
    279.96,284.04
     I'm gonna turn them towards my left leg so that'd be counterclockwise right Brad?
},
{
    284.04,289.12
     Yeah, and you can help by turning your toe in as well and that'll give a little direction
},
{
    289.12,292.02
     And then you're gonna bend while it's turning
},
{
    292.02,297.48
     And that's gonna a lot of times that's gonna help get things back in place and it's gonna help
},
{
    298.6,300.08
     aid the movement
},
{
    300.08,303.72
     Right, so you do the turn turn your toe in
},
{
    304.4,307.76
     As long as you can bend it further with less pain
},
{
    307.76,311.36
     You know you're right on you want to keep working on it for some reason if it
},
{
    312.24,318.38
     Increases a pain and can't go as far that's a red flag. Absolutely. Don't do it then you need to go to the next step
},
{
    318.38,322.66
     So what's nice about this is you can you know rip off a good set of six to ten of these
},
{
    323.28,325.52
     And you can do these every hour if you want as long as they give you that kind of off a good set of six to ten of these and you can do these every hour if you want
},
{
    325.52,328.82
     As long as they give you that kind of response, a good response
},
{
    328.82,335.94
     And if I'm on this leg I'm turning it clockwise now because I'm turning it towards the other leg and I'm doing the same thing there
},
{
    335.94,338.3
     All right Brad, do you want to show how about
},
{
    339.8,341.8
     Regaining extension or should I do that one?
},
{
    341.8,353.12
     Well, I'll do that because they might be able to see it better. I'll flip this around. So if you're in your chair and you've got a stool, any type of stool,
},
{
    353.12,356.44
     this actually this is nice because you can go two different levels depending on what you
},
{
    356.44,363.2
     feel comfortable with. But let's say on this leg you can see that I can't get full extension and
},
{
    363.2,368.12
     then you look at the other one and you can see it will drop right down.
},
{
    368.12,373.12
     So, and that, you know, oftentimes is a case with a sore knee that comes on without, you
},
{
    373.12,374.76
     know, trauma or falling.
},
{
    374.76,377.92
     So at this point, you want to get it up on the stool.
},
{
    377.92,379.44
     You could do it on the floor.
},
{
    379.44,381.56
     It works a little better on the stool.
},
{
    381.56,385.24
     Above the kneecap, you bring your hands here and you gently push and
},
{
    385.8,388.72
     Try to extend it more now you might want to turn your toe out
},
{
    389.24,391.84
     And see if it goes a little better that way or in
},
{
    392.16,397.12
     Yeah, because sometimes it does work again my wife is an example she did better when she turned it out
},
{
    397.12,403.6
     Sure, yep, and and it's really funny because a lot of times you may not even realize that that knee doesn't straighten all the way
},
{
    403.92,407.54
     But when you compare the two you say oh my gosh, it doesn't straighten all the way
},
{
    407.92,412.18
     So just to show it here's my foot straight you see you'll do this
},
{
    412.72,418.12
     pressure on pressure off five to ten repetitions or you can go this way or
},
{
    419.12,424.36
     In whichever way you get better results less pain more range of motion
},
{
    424.36,428.64
     Let's say by the first one it hurts a little bit and then you buy the fourth or the fifth one
},
{
    428.64,430.98
     It's like oh, I'm getting farther feels better
},
{
    431.4,434.04
     That's the green green light green light
},
{
    434.04,438.24
     It could also be if it feels better after you've done it
},
{
    438.24,442.28
     Right, you know while you're doing it doesn't feel the best but when you get done it feels better
},
{
    442.28,445.76
     Right you're walking around and it's like oh that's better than you know
},
{
    445.76,449.08
     These are all little tricks of our trade sort of skin
},
{
    449.08,453.48
     Yeah, and he said pressure on pressure off because the reason you do that is gonna tells you how long to do it
},
{
    453.48,455.48
     So you say pressure on
},
{
    455.56,460.88
     Pressure on there you go as opposed to just holding it for 20 seconds. Yeah
},
{
    461.4,468.52
     It's real calming isn't it pressure on wax on wax wax on, wax off. There you go. Okay the other next thing, number four
},
{
    469.4,473.54
     We got five of them here total. Brad's gonna show the patella stretch
},
{
    473.54,479.36
     Oh, just do that on that chair. Patella mobs. Yeah, so this is Patella's kneecap
},
{
    479.36,484.6
     I just had someone with knee pain she came in and she was in her 50s. She had knee pain
},
{
    486.64,492.0
     someone with knee pain she came in and she was in her 50s she had knee pain no apparent reason and this is one of the exercises I had her do I had her do that pressure on pressure off and her knee
},
{
    492.0,497.84
     cap was a little tight so when you do this it's critical that you completely relax your leg your
},
{
    497.84,504.24
     quadriceps must be relaxed can you see that movement there it is yep that's the patella knee
},
{
    504.24,509.6
     taking that look easy a lot of people you know, again they tighten up and it's really hard to move.
},
{
    509.6,514.6
     See if I tighten it, it doesn't move at all so it's like relax, relax, all these muscles relax.
},
{
    514.6,523.1
     And I'll have, I'll take the kneecap, move it up and down and right to left and you can do some diagonals on there as well
},
{
    523.1,525.54
     to make sure you cover all the bases again
},
{
    525.54,532.24
     If this sometimes in one direction it may be painful you go pressure on pressure off after three or four
},
{
    532.6,536.34
     repetitions if that pain starts to get relieved go away
},
{
    536.5,539.08
     Then you keep working it if for some reason
},
{
    539.62,544.16
     It's just continues to irritate it and the pain goes up after four or five repetitions
},
{
    544.3,548.32
     Then you avoid that particularate it and the pain goes up after four or five repetitions Then you'd avoid that particular direction and work the pain free
},
{
    548.32,550.64
     We're not big believers of making your pain worse
},
{
    550.64,552.16
     Right, that's what it is
},
{
    552.16,557.12
     For a long-term fix Brad, this isn't something that's going to give you a quick relief
},
{
    557.14,561.48
     But this is like after you've maybe done some of these you want to get the knee stronger
},
{
    561.48,563.64
     Sure, so one way to do that is
},
{
    564.04,565.58
     Do you want to kind of clear
},
{
    565.58,568.78
     things off for the ball over there Brad? Yes I do. I want to do it showing this.
},
{
    568.78,573.46
     So I mean you can start just real simple some straight leg raises. So I'm
},
{
    573.46,577.16
     strengthening the knee, strengthen the hip a little bit too, but you can go ahead
},
{
    577.16,581.96
     and just bring this leg up, you're laying down and you're gonna start
},
{
    581.96,590.52
     strengthening that quadricep. You've tightened up that muscle there and you can do a good set of 20 to 30 of these if you want
},
{
    590.92,593.72
     If you can, that will be
},
{
    594.4,596.4
     Challenging if you haven't done them before
},
{
    596.4,599.24
     And then you can even go to the side
},
{
    599.8,608.48
     I'm strengthening this one now and you can go ahead and do some of these And now you're getting the IT band that's going across the knee and you're strengthening that a little bit
},
{
    608.48,612.46
     You can go flip over onto the stomach and do some of these
},
{
    612.88,618.24
     So we're kind of working three ways here getting a little bit of hamstring now and working it that way
},
{
    618.24,621.32
     So not only working the muscles at the knee, but the hip as well
},
{
    621.6,628.16
     They all work together you want to not particularly isolate but get the whole leg stronger. I can't tell you many times I find a
},
{
    628.16,632.08
     patient that who's having knee problems that they also have a weak hip. Right.
},
{
    632.08,635.08
     So it's not uncommon at all. I got it cleared away by now.
},
{
    635.08,637.92
     Alright thank you. Just wait. Oh look at this.
},
{
    637.92,640.92
     Well whatever you choose. There we go.
},
{
    640.92,647.04
     So now we're over to the wall here and this is just a great way to do some
},
{
    647.04,653.64
     strengthening of the knee. You can do some shallow wall squats and so what I like about this,
},
{
    653.64,658.72
     and Brad's going to show you right now, this keeps your knee from going past the toe when
},
{
    658.72,663.12
     you're doing the squat. Normally for the squat it's really easy to do it like this. Now watch
},
{
    663.12,667.26
     how the knee has gone past the toe and that puts more stress on the knee
},
{
    667.4,670.22
     So I'm right here. I can do shallow squats
},
{
    670.86,675.42
     It's really easy to do and you know if it feels better I can go a little bit deeper
},
{
    675.42,679.64
     Right as long as you keep that knee behind the plumb line of the toe
},
{
    679.64,685.2
     So the ball really takes stress off the knee because it accepts weight allows you to be
},
{
    685.88,688.48
     Relaxed, you know if you need something to hold on to
},
{
    689.12,692.24
     Because you haven't used the ball get a chair or you could have
},
{
    693.68,698.12
     And I want to make sure your feet aren't gonna slide too. Oh, I'm sorry
},
{
    698.8,700.56
     So here we go
},
{
    700.56,705.2
     We can go ahead and do you know you can rip off a good 20 30 of those if you want I do 30
},
{
    705.2,710.7
     As long as your knee is tolerated, right, also don't have your knees going in like this
},
{
    711.64,717.48
     Have them kind of out a little bit like this while you're doing it because this will often make your knee pain worse too
},
{
    717.48,None
     Sure you want that alignment. Alright, it looks like time's just about up so thanks everybody for watching. Take care
},
