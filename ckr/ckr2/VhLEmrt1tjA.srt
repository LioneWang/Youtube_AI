     In this video, I'm going to show you how to fix a tight lower back in 30 seconds.
},
{
    4.88,5.88
     Stay tuned.
},
{
    5.88,6.88
     Hey, everyone.
},
{
    6.88,14.56
     Dr. Rowe from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan.
},
{
    14.56,20.6
     If you're dealing with an achy, tight, locked up, stiff lower back and need a quick fix,
},
{
    20.6,23.08
     this is a video that you're not going to want to miss.
},
{
    23.08,27.64
     I'm going to show you safe and effective lower back stretches and exercises that may give
},
{
    27.64,31.36
     instant relief, even in as little as 30 seconds.
},
{
    31.36,33.88
     The great part is you can do all of these at home.
},
{
    33.88,37.96
     I'm not going to be using any special equipment other than an everyday racquetball.
},
{
    37.96,40.44
     You can get these locally at a sporting goods department.
},
{
    40.44,42.04
     They're very inexpensive.
},
{
    42.04,43.56
     They're about a dollar apiece.
},
{
    43.56,47.5
     So I'm going to break this down into an easy three-step process.
},
{
    47.5,50.2
     We're going to focus on getting rid of muscle knots first.
},
{
    50.2,53.5
     Then we're going to stretch everything out, get the lower back moving, and then I'm going
},
{
    53.5,58.16
     to show you a strengthening exercise that will hopefully get rid of lower back tightness
},
{
    58.16,59.16
     for good.
},
{
    59.16,63.1
     So let's get started with them and get the lower back feeling better right now.
},
{
    63.1,65.56
     So in the first part, let's focus on getting rid
},
{
    65.56,67.84
     of those muscle knots, those muscle spasms
},
{
    67.84,70.76
     in the lower back that's causing a lot of tightness.
},
{
    70.76,73.92
     I'm going to lay flat on my back and go up to a door.
},
{
    73.92,76.4
     With this one, you might find it easier to wear shoes
},
{
    76.4,78.32
     because you'll have a little bit more grip.
},
{
    78.32,81.4
     I position myself where my knees are bent at 90 degrees
},
{
    81.4,83.92
     and my heels are going to be pressed firmly
},
{
    83.92,85.52
     against that door.
},
{
    85.52,89.28
     Let's take the racquetball and go over to the side in the lower back that you feel like
},
{
    89.28,91.08
     you have a lot of muscle tightness.
},
{
    91.08,93.08
     Maybe there's a big muscle knot right there.
},
{
    93.08,98.1
     You just simply place the racquetball over the spot of muscle, make sure not to go over
},
{
    98.1,103.56
     the spine, only over the spot of the muscle itself, and then just rest your body weight
},
{
    103.56,104.76
     upon that.
},
{
    104.76,107.48
     Pull your arms off to the side just like this.
},
{
    107.48,114.06
     With it, just try to roll back and forth with your body weight over that spot and do a nice
},
{
    114.06,118.04
     self-massage for up to 10 to 15 seconds.
},
{
    118.04,122.1
     You should start to feel that lower back muscle start to release at that point getting rid
},
{
    122.1,123.54
     of a lot of tightness.
},
{
    123.54,125.76
     You can also go up and down with it.
},
{
    125.76,127.88
     You can just go in different motions.
},
{
    127.88,132.78
     But once you feel that muscle not relax, what you can do is just move it up and down or
},
{
    132.78,136.56
     switch sides and just target those spots too.
},
{
    136.56,140.6
     Let's say that you have one spot that's just really, really not releasing.
},
{
    140.6,142.76
     What you can do is put both legs down like this.
},
{
    142.76,150.0
     And what I'm going to do is position the ball over that spot and I'm going to lift whatever side that you're on, this leg, up
},
{
    150.0,154.4
     like this, kind of like a knee to the chest, and then I'm just going to rotate over towards
},
{
    154.4,158.8
     that side. What you're going to notice is that it puts a little bit more pressure into
},
{
    158.8,168.64
     that spot. Only go to your comfort level. Hold that for about 10 to 15 seconds. Relax, and then just repeat up to five times
},
{
    168.64,170.68
     or until you feel that muscle tightness
},
{
    170.68,172.04
     really start to go down.
},
{
    172.04,172.88
     And then from there,
},
{
    172.88,174.68
     switch to a different spot as needed
},
{
    174.68,176.16
     or towards the other side.
},
{
    176.16,178.56
     Next, let's focus on building mobility
},
{
    178.56,181.36
     into the lower back and loosening up stiffness and tightness
},
{
    181.36,184.28
     with some really easy stretches.
},
{
    184.28,185.62
     These stretches, I'm going
},
{
    185.62,188.54
     to show different ones that are going to focus on different muscle groups that
},
{
    188.54,192.18
     are commonly associated with lower back tightness and pain. So make sure to go
},
{
    192.18,195.58
     through all of them and go with the ones that you feel are the most effective.
},
{
    195.58,199.54
     This first one we're going to build a little bit more rotation into the lower
},
{
    199.54,203.66
     back. You can do this one in bed or on the floor. What I'm going to do lay flat
},
{
    203.66,206.02
     on my back and I'm going to bend the knees like this,
},
{
    206.02,207.02
     feet are going to be flat.
},
{
    207.02,211.52
     What I'm going to do next is take my arms, put them up towards the ceiling, elbows straight
},
{
    211.52,215.68
     and put them together like I'm almost going to clap my hands right here.
},
{
    215.68,218.78
     The movement is a two-part process.
},
{
    218.78,223.16
     I'm going to take the knees and I'm going to take them one way while my arms and my
},
{
    223.16,225.96
     upper back goes in the opposite direction. You'll see what I'm going to take them one way while my arms and my upper back goes in the opposite direction.
},
{
    225.96,227.96
     So you'll see what I'm gonna do right here.
},
{
    227.96,229.96
     Taking the knees towards my left
},
{
    229.96,233.84
     while my arms kept straight, go towards the right.
},
{
    233.84,235.32
     And when you do this, you're going to feel
},
{
    235.32,239.28
     a very good amount of stretch into the lower back.
},
{
    239.28,241.6
     Go to the point where it feels like a very good stretch,
},
{
    241.6,243.32
     but it's not causing discomfort.
},
{
    243.32,244.56
     Once you hit that point,
},
{
    244.56,247.1
     hold this for about two to three seconds.
},
{
    247.1,250.16
     You just relax, and then you're going to repeat it
},
{
    250.16,252.24
     on the opposite side.
},
{
    252.24,254.72
     Two to three seconds, come back up to the middle,
},
{
    254.72,256.84
     and then go towards the opposite side.
},
{
    256.84,259.92
     When you do this, you may feel a pop, crack,
},
{
    259.92,262.24
     or click into the lower back.
},
{
    262.24,265.2
     If that happens, that is completely normal. It's just gases being released in the lower back. If that happens, that is completely normal.
},
{
    265.2,268.72
     It's just gases being released in the lower back.
},
{
    268.72,272.52
     But you want to try to do this about 10 to 12 times
},
{
    272.52,273.8
     on each side.
},
{
    273.8,276.4
     So moving on from there, let's focus a little bit more
},
{
    276.4,278.68
     on the hips and the pelvis because there's a lot
},
{
    278.68,280.92
     of issues from there that can cause lower back
},
{
    280.92,282.4
     tightness and pain.
},
{
    282.4,284.64
     So we're gonna start on our back and what I'm going to do
},
{
    284.64,286.24
     is what's called the 90-90
},
{
    286.24,287.44
     stretch.
},
{
    287.44,290.6
     Let's put our legs about shoulder width apart.
},
{
    290.6,291.68
     Feet are going to be flat.
},
{
    291.68,297.4
     What I'm going to do is I'm going to lower both of my legs down like this to the point
},
{
    297.4,301.12
     where the hip, the knees, and the ankle are at 90 degrees.
},
{
    301.12,305.44
     Keep lowering them down towards the bad or towards the floor as much as you can.
},
{
    305.44,310.48
     You should feel a very good stretch into the back of the legs, around the glute, the hip,
},
{
    310.48,311.48
     and the lower back.
},
{
    311.48,314.16
     Actually, just got a nice little release right there.
},
{
    314.16,319.12
     Hold this one for 15 seconds, come back up, and then you're just going to go onto the
},
{
    319.12,324.24
     opposite side, really trying to bring those knees down as much as you can, only to your
},
{
    324.24,328.92
     comfort level though. Holding 15 seconds, coming back up, and then when you go on the
},
{
    328.92,333.16
     opposite side try to bring the legs down just a little bit more to get a better
},
{
    333.16,337.46
     stretch into the lower back. And you're going to want to do this five complete
},
{
    337.46,342.72
     times on each side. It's wonderful for getting rid of hip, pelvic, and lower back
},
{
    342.72,346.72
     tightness. So this next lower back tightness stretch
},
{
    346.72,350.12
     is a modified yoga pose called the child's pose.
},
{
    350.12,352.64
     And you're going to want to do this one on the floor.
},
{
    352.64,354.04
     We're going to start off on the knees,
},
{
    354.04,356.8
     put a thick towel or pillow underneath your knees
},
{
    356.8,357.86
     for comfort.
},
{
    357.86,360.88
     If you've never done this stretch, it's wonderful.
},
{
    360.88,363.32
     It's going to focus pretty much from the shoulders
},
{
    363.32,365.3
     all the way down into the lower back.
},
{
    365.3,369.44
     You may feel it even down to the tailbone if the muscles are that tight.
},
{
    369.44,374.88
     What I'm going to do is I'm going to go on all fours like this and then out stretch my
},
{
    374.88,376.52
     arms as much as I can.
},
{
    376.52,380.52
     When you do this, you should already start to feel a very good stretch into the upper
},
{
    380.52,381.52
     back.
},
{
    381.52,386.8
     And what I'm going to do from there is I'm going to start to lower my butt down towards
},
{
    386.8,388.1
     the heels.
},
{
    388.1,391.32
     And what I'm trying to do is really keep the arms straight like this.
},
{
    391.32,394.76
     And then from there, let's tuck our chin towards our chest.
},
{
    394.76,398.64
     The further that you go down, the more that you're going to feel that stretch into the
},
{
    398.64,401.9
     lower back, almost like a good pulling traction.
},
{
    401.9,406.88
     This really opens up those joint spaces and stretches those muscles out.
},
{
    406.88,411.0
     If you can hold this one for 15 seconds, that's a good starting point, but try to work your
},
{
    411.0,416.76
     way up to 30 seconds, possibly even up to a minute, only to your comfort level.
},
{
    416.76,420.36
     Really just focus on nice, slow, controlled breathing.
},
{
    420.36,424.28
     Let the tension out, that tightness will start to follow.
},
{
    424.28,427.06
     And then from there, I'm just going to relax.
},
{
    427.06,432.06
     And then I'm going to repeat this up to three to five times or until you feel that lower
},
{
    432.06,435.48
     back tightness really start to go away.
},
{
    435.48,440.54
     The second part of this and how we're going to focus on, let's say, one side of tightness
},
{
    440.54,442.38
     is this.
},
{
    442.38,444.56
     Let's go off to one side.
},
{
    444.56,446.36
     So I'm going to angle my upper body towards
},
{
    446.36,450.14
     the right, kind of like going towards that way. And then I'm just going to
},
{
    450.14,455.6
     repeat this stretch. And when you do this, you're going to feel a very, very
},
{
    455.6,460.16
     good stretch on the opposite side. So when I'm angled towards the right, I'm
},
{
    460.16,468.28
     really feeling it on the left. Try to do this again up to 60 seconds if you're able to and then just relaxing and repeating
},
{
    468.28,470.22
     up to three to five times.
},
{
    470.22,472.72
     From there, switch to the other side.
},
{
    472.72,477.6
     Even if it doesn't hurt, just do it to keep the muscles in balance and repeat that same
},
{
    477.6,479.36
     process.
},
{
    479.36,483.48
     Wonderful for hitting the whole back from the upper to the lower.
},
{
    483.48,487.8
     This next one is a compound stretch that hits a lot of muscles that are associated with
},
{
    487.8,493.68
     lower back tightness including the piriformis and QL or quadratus lumborum muscle.
},
{
    493.68,497.76
     Let's start off on the floor and get into a figure four position just like this.
},
{
    497.76,500.04
     Your leg should look like the figure four.
},
{
    500.04,505.36
     Keep one knee bent like this and you want the whole leg flat against the floor as possible.
},
{
    505.36,508.76
     The foot is going to be just firmly against the other leg.
},
{
    508.76,512.92
     What I'm going to do from there is take the hand on the opposite side of the bent knee.
},
{
    512.92,516.28
     I'm going to place it on top of the knee and then the other hand just rests on the floor
},
{
    516.28,517.56
     like this for comfort.
},
{
    517.56,519.2
     Let's get in good upright posture.
},
{
    519.2,521.08
     Again, make sure to keep the knee flat.
},
{
    521.08,528.88
     I'm going to just rotate towards the opposite side as far as I feel comfortable. Actually I just got a nice crack in my back right there. It's
},
{
    528.88,534.08
     very common to get releases in the lower back with this stretch so if you do get
},
{
    534.08,538.2
     one again it's just gas being released. Once you feel a very good stretch you
},
{
    538.2,542.76
     hold this one for 10 to 15 seconds. You're just going to relax and then
},
{
    542.76,545.68
     you're going to repeat this up to five times.
},
{
    545.68,549.08
     And each time you do it, try to go a little bit further with it.
},
{
    549.08,551.84
     So this is how we're going to take it to the next level.
},
{
    551.84,556.84
     With this stretch, once I get to that point, I'm going to then take my hand off the ground,
},
{
    556.84,561.08
     and I'm going to then bend towards the opposite direction.
},
{
    561.08,565.06
     This is going to activate that QL, or quadratus lumborum muscle. So
},
{
    565.06,570.24
     you're bending towards the opposite side. Very good stretch. Hold this one for 10
},
{
    570.24,574.16
     to 15 seconds. You're just going to relax. Try to build a little bit more
},
{
    574.16,579.08
     rotation in there and then just bend towards the opposite direction only to
},
{
    579.08,586.84
     your comfort level. Try to do 10 to 15 second holds four, five times. And then from there, just simply switch
},
{
    586.84,589.16
     to the other side and repeat.
},
{
    589.16,591.8
     So without a doubt, if we're looking to get rid
},
{
    591.8,594.58
     of lower back tightness and stiffness for good,
},
{
    594.58,598.52
     we have to strengthen the muscles around the lower back,
},
{
    598.52,599.72
     including the legs.
},
{
    599.72,602.96
     And I know everybody doesn't like doing exercises,
},
{
    602.96,605.16
     so I wanna give you one that's super easy
},
{
    605.16,606.16
     and simple.
},
{
    606.16,608.08
     There's no excuses with this one.
},

     We're going to do a modified lower back bridge exercise.
},
{
    612.12,614.52
     So you can do this one in bed or on the floor.
},
{
    614.52,620.0
     Let's lay flat, knees bent, and our feet are going to be flat against the bed or the floor.
},
{
    620.0,623.64
     What I'm going to do is just simply lift my butt up like this, and to the point where
},
{
    623.64,629.56
     my knees, my hips, and my shoulders are going to be in a nice straight line or straight as
},
{
    629.56,630.72
     possible.
},
{
    630.72,634.84
     When you do this, you're going to feel the core muscles, the lower back, the glutes
},
{
    634.84,637.16
     buttock, and the back of the legs firing.
},
{
    637.16,641.84
     It's helping to strengthen and stretch all of these at the same time.
},
{
    641.84,642.88
     Pretty good, huh?
},
{
    642.88,649.56
     You want to hold this one starting off for 10 seconds. Work your way up to 15-30 possibly even longer if you feel
},
{
    649.56,654.32
     comfortable. But once you need a breather, just relax and then repeat this one up
},
{
    654.32,659.6
     to five times. If this one becomes too easy, what you can do from there is do a
},
{
    659.6,665.68
     marching step like this. And you want to hold this for about five seconds.
},
{
    665.68,669.28
     You're just going to relax and go on to the opposite side.
},
{
    669.28,673.6
     Try to do about 10 to 12 repetitions of this on each side.
},
{
    673.6,678.96
     It's really going to challenge those muscles, especially into the legs, lower back, and
},
{
    678.96,679.96
     glutes.
},
{
    679.96,684.32
     If this one becomes too easy, what you can do from there is then straighten the leg up
},
{
    684.32,685.88
     like this, which will activate the hamstring. For me, this one's too easy. What you can do from there is then straighten the leg up like this, which will activate
},
{
    685.88,686.88
     the hamstring.
},
{
    686.88,688.84
     For me, this one's pretty hard.
},
{
    688.84,691.4
     I hold this one again for up to five seconds.
},
{
    691.4,693.04
     I'm just going to relax.
},
{
    693.04,697.48
     I'm going to lift the other leg up like this, straighten it to really activate the back
},
{
    697.48,702.44
     of the leg, holding five seconds, trying to do 10 to 12 repetitions of this.
},
{
    702.44,705.88
     Great way to hit all of those muscles, strengthen, and stretch
},
{
    705.88,711.18
     them all at the same time and hopefully give some quick lower back tightness relief, maybe
},
{
    711.18,715.18
     even in as little as 30 seconds. If you like the video and got a lot of relief, please
