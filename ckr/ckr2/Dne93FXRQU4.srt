{
    0.0,8.84
     So this is a case where when your knee, just to make sure we have the correct history,
},
{
    8.84,12.36
     so when your knee is straight, it feels unstable.
},
{
    12.36,13.36
     Correct.
},
{
    13.36,14.36
     Correct.
},
{
    14.36,15.36
     And there's no trauma.
},
{
    15.36,18.12
     No, no trauma at all.
},
{
    18.12,21.72
     And there's a little bit of swelling on the inside.
},
{
    21.72,22.72
     Correct.
},
{
    22.72,31.7
     Okay, so we have everything. So what I noticed when I did this is I put my finger right on the on the joint
},
{
    31.7,38.62
     line. So right here is the tibia and I went along the tibia where typically a
},
{
    38.62,45.88
     person would tear a meniscus which is unlikely with him, and wasn't really that bad.
},
{
    45.88,50.48
     But then it's like puffy right there on the inside.
},
{
    50.48,55.52
     And what I do is I just push the fluid this way, and you could feel how much fluid there
},
{
    55.52,57.48
     is on that inside.
},
{
    57.48,59.32
     So something was deranged there.
},
{
    59.32,67.04
     And then I just double checked the outside joint line. Then what I did is motion palpation where you can actually
},
{
    67.04,72.88
     see how the joint moves itself. So I could take my fingers and place them right there
},
{
    72.88,79.16
     and then you bend, fully bend the knee and then extend it like that. And what should
},
{
    79.16,86.08
     occur and it occurs in him is most people, the knee is an actual hinge joint, but it's actually not.
},
{
    86.08,89.52
     It's a hinge joint, but then it rotates like this.
},
{
    89.52,90.8
     Did you know that?
},
{
    90.8,92.84
     Learn something new every day.
},
{
    92.84,93.76
     I was not aware of that.
},
{
    93.76,97.32
     Yeah, so what happens is, when you fully extend the knee,
},
{
    97.32,101.6
     this part should go up higher than this part.
},
{
    101.6,103.8
     So what I'm doing is when I take my fingers
},
{
    103.8,104.62
     and I place them there,
},
{
    104.62,111.84
     you wanna feel that joint motion occur occur and yours does do it. So that's actually normal. Then
},
{
    111.84,116.32
     what I do is I take the tibia and I rotate it this way and I rotate it this way and you
},
{
    116.32,123.0
     can actually visually see if you put a little mark. Let me make a little mark right there.
},
{
    123.0,126.28
     Just so you know that's not blood. When you look
},
{
    126.28,132.28
     later, what did he do to me? So when I rotate this way and I rotate this way,
},
{
    132.28,137.2
     you could see the tibia underneath the skin. I don't know if the shadow will
},
{
    137.2,143.64
     show it. It kind of rotates and what's interesting is like if you look at here,
},
{
    143.64,146.2
     this little bump right here, that's normal.
},
{
    146.2,149.52
     It goes down and it goes forward.
},
{
    149.52,154.36
     And in his case, the tibia, this bone here,
},
{
    154.36,158.08
     does not want to rotate real well that way.
},
{
    158.08,160.96
     So when I go this way, it should have a lot more rotation.
},
{
    160.96,162.76
     So he's done something to the joint.
},
{
    162.76,171.54
     Now, there's a muscle in the back called the popliteus and when I go to the inside part here and I go behind it and I press, I push
},
{
    171.54,176.34
     the calf out of the way and I go right under there just to see if it's tender and it was
},
{
    176.34,181.62
     a little tender in him. And then I go to the lateral joint line and right there is the
},
{
    181.62,186.64
     fibula, the fibula head and I go right there, right deep in there is the fibula, the fibula head, and I go right there, right deep in
},
{
    186.64,190.24
     there is the insertion of the papillatus.
},
{
    190.24,194.52
     And there's a muscle test that you can do, and what's interesting with him is if you
},
{
    194.52,202.32
     put your heel right on the table, and then you bring the toes up, and you rotate the
},
{
    202.32,208.0
     toes in that way, I'm going to try to pull it this way and see how strong that the pleatus is.
},
{
    208.0,211.0
     So when I do it, go ahead and push, Jason.
},
{
    211.0,216.0
     It kind of gives a little. It doesn't want to lock the joint.
},
{
    216.0,220.0
     Which is, if it's not able to lock the joint, it's going to be unstable.
},
{
    220.0,225.24
     So like comparison, when I do this leg and we rotate the tibia here, bring it in,
},
{
    225.24,228.84
     and I pull it, it's solid as a rock.
},
{
    228.84,230.48
     So now I'm gonna show the treatment
},
{
    230.48,232.24
     of how I treat the papillias.
},
{
    232.24,234.14
     All right, so lie down on your stomach.
},
{
    236.04,239.08
     And this is the part where the patient does not smile
},
{
    239.08,240.32
     if the doctor does.
},
{
    240.32,241.16
     Ha ha ha ha.
},
{
    243.32,250.28
     So I'm gonna go along the tendons of the hamstring.
},
{
    250.28,252.68
     It's called a semi-membranosis and semi-tendonosis.
},
{
    252.68,259.72
     I'm going to push those out of the way, that way, and I push the calf muscle out of the
},
{
    259.72,266.0
     way there and I get right in there on the Poplegius and it hurts, huh?
},
{
    266.0,268.0
     Okay, so it is sensitive. So what I'm
},
{
    268.0,269.0
     going to do is I'm going to start here
},
{
    269.0,272.0
     with your foot rotated in and what we're
},
{
    272.0,273.0
     going to do is we're going to rotate the
},
{
    273.0,276.0
     foot out and I've got pressure there and
},
{
    276.0,278.0
     I'm right on the insertion point of the
},
{
    278.0,281.0
     Poplegius, right where it inserts to the
},
{
    281.0,285.0
     bone. Just breathe normal.
},
{
    287.0,288.0
     Try not to hold your breath.
},
{
    290.0,291.0
     There you go.
},
{
    292.0,296.0
     And so I'm on the insertion point of the popliteus,
},
{
    297.0,301.0
     and what we're doing is we're going to stimulate the nerves that sense
},
{
    302.0,304.0
     when that muscle is supposed to work.
},
{
    305.0,308.8
     And now I'm going to go to the origin point.
},
{
    308.8,310.44
     There's the fibula.
},
{
    310.44,316.0
     There's the bicep femoris, and we've got to stay off the peroneal nerve.
},
{
    316.0,319.0
     So I've got it right there.
},
{
    319.0,322.52
     Got my finger right there.
},
{
    322.52,325.3
     Just keep blowing the air out.
},
{
    327.38,329.38
     There you go. Two more.
},
{
    336.78,338.78
     One more.
},
{
    342.0,346.36
     Good. All right, so now I'll stare right there.
},
{
    346.36,349.68
     So now I'm going to use the arthur stem.
},
{
    349.68,353.84
     So now what you want to do, Jason, is you're going to start here and I'm going to put my
},
{
    353.84,359.68
     hand on your foot and you want to push your leg down with your quadricep and try to get
},
{
    359.68,363.12
     your foot down over here so the knee fully extends.
},
{
    363.12,364.12
     Okay.
},
{
    364.12,366.0
     Okay, so let's do a practice run.
},
{
    366.0,369.92
     So go ahead and try to push it and twist your foot out.
},
{
    369.92,371.68
     Twist my foot.
},
{
    371.68,372.6
     There you go.
},
{
    372.6,373.44
     That's it.
},
{
    373.44,374.44
     So you want to twist it this way.
},
{
    374.44,375.28
     Yep.
},
{
    375.28,376.12
     Yeah.
},
{
    376.12,379.32
     Like you're kicking a hacky sack on the outside.
},
{
    379.32,380.56
     There you go.
},
{
    380.56,381.72
     That was perfect.
},
{
    381.72,382.56
     That was perfect.
},
{
    382.56,387.08
     Now, it's gonna be a little funny because're going to feel this as I'm doing it,
},
{
    387.08,388.64
     but try not to focus on this.
},
{
    388.64,390.2
     Try to focus on your foot.
},
{
    390.2,391.7
     That is my extension.
},
{
    391.7,392.7
     Exactly.
},
{
    392.7,396.12
     And twisting the toe to the outside, the little toe to the outside.
},
{
    396.12,401.52
     So take a deep breath in and blow the air out and push.
},
{
    401.52,407.0
     Good. And then do it again.
},
{
    407.0,408.0
     Good.
},
{
    408.0,416.6
     So now we're going to get a little more pushing the toe out so you're going to feel me against
},
{
    416.6,417.6
     my body.
},
{
    417.6,418.6
     Okay.
},
{
    418.6,422.92
     And this just gives the person a little more kinesthetic awareness for lack of a better
},
{
    422.92,425.16
     explanation so you have something to push against.
},
{
    425.16,426.88
     So push against my body with the outside.
},
{
    426.88,427.72
     That's it.
},
{
    427.72,428.96
     That's what you want.
},
{
    428.96,433.16
     Okay, so as you're doing that, push down with your knees.
},
{
    433.16,436.08
     So take a deep breath in and start pushing.
},
{
    436.08,440.44
     There you go.
},
{
    440.44,441.92
     Good.
},
{
    441.92,442.76
     Two more times.
},
{
    442.76,443.6
     Push.
},
{
    443.6,465.72
     Push down. Good. Last time. Go ahead and push. There you go Now lie down on your back again.
},
{
    465.72,470.52
     So the whole point of that is to try to get your, that muscle to hold your knee nice and
},
{
    470.52,475.16
     tight so that it doesn't feel like it's unstable.
},
{
    475.16,476.16
     Okay.
},
{
    476.16,477.88
     Are you going to ride this weekend?
},
{
    477.88,478.88
     Yeah.
},
{
    478.88,479.88
     Do you want to do anything?
},
{
    479.88,480.88
     Okay.
},
{
    480.88,483.68
     So you can ride after doing all this and test it out.
},
{
    483.68,488.52
     So what I'm going to do first is let's check the motion now.
},
{
    488.52,491.96
     So I'm going to place my fingers right here.
},
{
    491.96,493.84
     And let's see how much rotation you have.
},
{
    497.92,500.76
     That feels better to me.
},
{
    500.76,502.68
     So let's check the muscle now.
},
{
    502.68,507.0
     So bring your foot up, turn it in, and I'm going to push really hard.
},
{
    507.0,514.0
     One, two, three, hold. Okay. That feel different to you?
},
{
    514.0,515.0
     No, I fired a lot more.
},
{
    515.0,517.0
     Fired up? You felt it stronger than me?
},
{
    517.0,518.0
     I feel like contraction, yeah.
},
{
    518.0,523.0
     Okay. You know what, just for kicks, and you're allowed to say no. All right?
},
{
    523.0,526.88
     But just stand up and see if it feels any better.
},
{
    526.88,528.88
     I mean, it may not right away.
},
{
    528.88,532.16
     It may take a little while to kind of lock it down.
},
{
    532.16,534.04
     It doesn't feel more solid on the extension.
},
{
    534.04,535.84
     It doesn't feel more solid on the extension.
},
{
    535.84,536.84
     Yes, yeah.
},
{
    536.84,537.84
     So here's what I want you to do.
},
{
    537.84,540.36
     I want you to feel, it feels more balanced as well as it
},
{
    540.36,544.32
     doesn't feel like it's wobbling before a double block.
},
{
    544.32,545.16
     So here's what I want you to do
},
{
    545.16,550.44
     I want you to fully this is a little exercise you can do you fully extend your knee so your quads are locked
},
{
    550.44,552.6
     And what I want you to do is point your toe up
},
{
    553.32,558.94
     Okay, and out that way and I want you to push against something so you could push against a wall
},
{
    559.6,562.2
     Or something so you're doing an isometric contraction
},
{
    563.44,566.84
     Isometric meaning the muscles not moving itself.
},
{
    566.84,569.36
     The like, so what's gonna happen is you bring your foot up
},
{
    569.36,571.28
     and you try to turn it out like that
},
{
    571.28,572.48
     and then lock your knee.
},
{
    572.48,573.8
     Don't keep it bent,
},
{
    573.8,576.48
     because then you're not really getting that muscle.
},
{
    576.48,578.12
     So you're gonna push out like that
},
{
    578.12,581.72
     and that's gonna help that muscle relax a little bit.
},
{
    581.72,582.56
     Okay.
},
{
    582.56,587.6
     And then what you're gonna do if you can remember all this
},
{
    588.12,590.0
     is let me have a chair.
},
{
    590.0,591.5
     I'm gonna go with that chair.
},
{
    593.6,595.8
     Then what you'll do is you'll take your foot,
},
{
    597.0,601.22
     keep it 90 degrees, point it up, turn it in,
},
{
    602.16,603.24
     and push that way.
},
{
    603.24,604.96
     So it's both ways.
},
{
    604.96,605.58
     Okay. Okay,'s both ways. Okay.
},
{
    605.58,606.26
     Okay.
},
{
    606.26,607.26
     So try that.
},
{
    610.26,612.58
     So you got to get close to the wall or something like that.
},
{
    612.58,614.58
     So first thing, cock your foot.
},
{
    614.58,616.7
     Keep trying to keep it 90 degrees, best thing.
},
{
    616.7,621.14
     Cock it up, turn it in, and then push that way.
},
{
    621.14,623.98
     And you'll feel you're using knee rotational muscles.
},
{
    623.98,628.0
     Yeah, I can. Yeah, but this one you're going to do at 90 degrees.
},
{
    628.0,632.0
     And the other one locked. And the other one locked, pushing out.
},
{
    632.0,636.0
     Okay. And what that does is remember when I was saying it, how your knee
},
{
    636.0,640.0
     joint kind of moves like this, that's what you're doing.
},
