     Now let's cover healthcare provider level rescue breathing for the child patient.
},
{
    8.46,13.8
     The scene is safe, our gloves are on, our one-way valve CPR shield is available.
},
{
    13.8,17.84
     We notice that the child is down and we call out, child are you okay?
},
{
    17.84,19.56
     Child, can you hear me?
},
{
    19.56,22.88
     There's no response, they do not appear to be breathing normally.
},
{
    22.88,31.22
     We activate the emergency medical services or call 911 or call a code. Now I'm going to check for a carotid pulse. If it's
},
{
    32.3,36.44
     hard to feel the pulse, tilt the head back and it will open up that carotid artery a
},
{
    36.44,42.54
     little better. But I do easily feel a carotid pulse. The pulse is present. But the patient
},
{
    42.54,49.82
     is not breathing or not breathing normally. So I'm going to begin rescue breaths. We're going to give rescue breaths with our mask,
},
{
    49.82,54.16
     one breath every three seconds, and we're going to continue the one breath every three
},
{
    54.16,59.2
     seconds for a total of two minutes. After two minutes, we're going to reassess for a
},
{
    59.2,64.08
     carotid pulse. If the pulse is still present, but the patient is not breathing, we're going
},
{
    64.08,67.72
     to continue rescue breathing for another two minutes.
},
{
    67.72,72.64
     If at some point in the two minute checks we find there is no pulse, no breathing, we
},
{
    72.64,74.12
     move to CPR.
},
{
    74.12,77.36
     But in this case, we're going to continue rescue breathing until the emergency medical
},
{
    77.36,78.4
     services arrive.
},
{
    78.4,84.56
     The scene is safe, my gloves are on, my shield is available.
},
{
    84.56,86.24
     Hey child, are you okay?
},
{
    86.24,87.24
     You're okay?
},
{
    87.24,90.0
     There's no response, they don't appear to be breathing.
},
{
    90.0,94.62
     You in the plaid shirt, go call 911 or activate the emergency medical services or call a code
},
{
    94.62,101.6
     and come back, I might need your help.
},
{
    101.6,104.36
     I do easily feel a pulse but they're not breathing.
},
{
    104.36,108.68
     I'm going to start rescue breathing.
},
{
    108.68,111.68
     One one thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand.
},
{
    111.68,115.36
     One one thousand, two one thousand.
},
{
    115.36,119.32
     One one thousand, two one thousand.
},
{
    119.32,123.12
     One one thousand, two one thousand.
},
{
    123.12,127.0
     About two minutes goes by. I'm going to check a pulse.
},
{
    127.0,131.0
     Pulse is still present, but the patient is not breathing. Continue rescue breathing.
},
{
    131.0,135.0
     If after two minutes I check a pulse, there is no pulse, there's no breathing,
},
{
    135.0,140.0
     I'll begin CPR and wait for an AED or the emergency medical services to respond.
},
