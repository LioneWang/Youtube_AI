     Hello, I'm examining my patient's neck as a part of a thyroid examination.
},
{
    18.0,23.0
     Between your doctor visits, you can check your thyroid at home by performing a simple
},
{
    23.0,26.64
     neck check. To do this, all you need
},
{
    26.64,36.56
     is a glass of water and a mirror. Can you take a sip of water? What you see is the thyroid
},
{
    36.56,43.52
     going up and then down. The more you do this at home, the more familiar you will get with
},
{
    43.52,45.68
     what you're seeing, which is the
},
{
    45.68,49.16
     movement of the thyroid and what it looks like.
},
{
    49.16,53.48
     Contact your doctor if you see changes in shape or size.
},
{
    53.48,58.72
     My patients often ask me to describe the thyroid and what it does.
},
{
    58.72,62.8
     The thyroid is a small gland found at the base of the neck.
},
{
    62.8,66.36
     It sits in front of the bin pipe and is made up of
},
{
    66.36,73.36
     two sections, one to the left and one to the right, joined in the middle by a little tissue.
},
{
    73.36,80.64
     Think of the gland as being made up of two lima beans, one on each side. It kind of looks
},
{
    80.64,87.88
     like a butterfly wing. It's very light and only weighs about an ounce or two.
},
{
    87.88,91.72
     The thyroid is a very important part of the endocrine system.
},
{
    91.72,95.16
     It controls the organ systems of your body.
},
{
    95.16,100.4
     It produces hormones that are released from the gland and travel through the bloodstream
},
{
    100.4,102.48
     to all of your body cells.
},
{
    102.48,107.28
     When your thyroid is not healthy, you develop symptoms such as fatigue,
},
{
    107.28,110.44
     weight gain or weight loss, even depression.
},
{
    111.48,113.56
     Because these symptoms can be caused
},
{
    113.56,116.32
     by other diseases and disorders,
},
{
    116.32,119.56
     it's important to discuss them with your doctor
},
{
    119.56,122.88
     so you can get to the bottom of why you're not well.
},
{
    122.88,126.0
     Sexual dysfunction, menstrual disorders, and
},
{
    126.0,132.52
     infertility also are symptoms of thyroid disease. As a matter of fact, it is very important
},
{
    132.52,137.44
     to screen for thyroid disorders if you're planning to have a baby. This message is for
},
{
    137.44,148.0
     everyone. When you go to the doctor, insist on having your neck examined and having a TSH screening test.
