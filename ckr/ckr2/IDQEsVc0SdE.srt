{
    900.0,901.0
     I'll...
},
{
    901.0,912.88
     Sorry, sorry, sorry
},
{
    916.24,924.0
     Tight to you feel that I feel tight like that
},
{
    927.0,928.0
     Okay, let's do it again, open. How's that?
},
{
    928.0,930.0
     That's so much better.
},
{
    930.0,931.0
     Wow.
},
{
    931.0,934.0
     Are you sure it's coming from your jaw?
},
{
    934.0,939.0
     Because I'm working on the back end.
},
{
    939.0,947.0
     That's getting more range of motion working on your head.
},
{
    957.0,960.0
     Let's open again. How's that?
},
{
    960.0,962.0
     It's like so much better.
},
{
    962.0,971.28
     Is that your normal or you're usually opening wider than I think you're seeing? No, because I've always kind of have problems with my CMJ, but it's like been on like the
},
{
    971.28,979.24
     back burner kind of. Open. You see now it's get the whole face.
},
{
    979.24,986.48
     Did? Yeah, perfect. Okay, so it's like almost four-y. It's good. We start with 28. Wow.
},
{
    987.36,996.16
     Well, do you want to get more? Yeah. Okay. So even though it's job hand, I'm actually working
},
{
    996.16,1005.92
     in a different area. And you will learn that with astral treatment how to figure out where is the restriction that actually causes
},
{
    1005.92,1013.92
     tightness in the referred area so and that's what we gain like more range of
},
{
    1013.92,1028.0
     motion so any pain that's come forward that sounds. So it was 28 degrees.
},
{
    1028.0,1032.0
     Let's sit up nice and tall and try it again.
},
{
    1032.0,1036.0
     Yeah, it's about four.
},
{
    1036.0,1038.0
     That's normal. Good.
},
{
    1038.0,1040.0
     So turn around.
},
{
    1040.0,1044.0
     So tell me now how much, how you feel, like headache and the tightness
},
{
    1044.0,1051.0
     and the muscle spasm that you came with how you feel now and definitely feel like much
},
{
    1051.0,1058.84
     more relieved I mean this is like just completely gone right here just still
},
{
    1058.84,1067.0
     feel like a little bit in my jaw but the sense. But what about open and open and close like five times now and see how that feel?
},
{
    1067.0,1075.0
     It still hurts like but the range of motion is I can't even like...
},
{
    1075.0,1080.0
     Yeah you were like 28 degrees now you like 40 degrees. Yeah that's good.
},
{
    1080.0,1083.0
     So what do you think about Aster treatment?
},
{
    1083.0,1084.0
     That's good.
},
{
    1084.0,1085.6
     Yeah yeah yeah. Should I do you think about Aster treatment? It's good. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
},
{
    1085.6,1087.4
     Should I do that kind of stuff?
},
{
    1087.4,1089.8
     We'll talk about what we're going to do at home.
},
