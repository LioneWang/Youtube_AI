    0.0,3.44
     Hey guys, I'm Sebastian. I'm going to show you four of my favorite stretches for a pinch
},
{
    3.44,8.16
     under the lower back. We use this very efficiently at Performance Play Sports here in Huntington
},
{
    8.16,12.56
     Beach. Keep in mind that when you're doing these, that if anything sends pain down your leg when
},
{
    12.56,16.64
     you're doing the stretch, then it's not the right stretch for you. So the first one we're going to
},
{
    16.64,22.24
     do is it's a simple glute stretch. And so usually I'll have people do this first on the uninvolved
},
{
    22.24,31.04
     side just to make sure that they're keeping things nice and even. It's not uncommon for people to stretch their affected side a lot and then they just kind
},
{
    31.04,35.44
     of leave this side neglected. So all we're going to do is take the hands and interlace the fingers
},
{
    35.44,40.32
     and bring the knee towards the chest here. When you bring it towards the chest what we don't want
},
{
    40.32,50.22
     is any pinching into this area of the groin. If that happens, you just back off a little bit or you just do a little bit of a look up. Now, looking up like this makes
},
{
    50.22,54.14
     it so the belly wall is active and it makes the stretch actually hold better in the long
},
{
    54.14,59.06
     term, but sometimes it can provoke pain down into a leg. Again, this is the symptomatic
},
{
    59.06,69.2
     leg. Again, if it goes down into the leg, you don't want to do it. But I usually have people kind of hold this for like 10 seconds, really challenge the
},
{
    69.2,75.88
     range as long as they don't feel that growing pinch, and then come down again.
},
{
    75.88,79.88
     If it doesn't feel good to do the crunch, again, you can do this from this position right
},
{
    79.88,80.88
     here.
},
{
    80.88,84.92
     Usually about five reps of about 10 seconds is sufficient per side.
},
{
    84.92,88.44
     And then you slowly switch to the other side and do the same thing,
},
{
    88.46,90.2
     test the waters, see how it feels.
},
{
    90.8,94.34
     The next stretch is going to be a similar position where we're going to bring
},
{
    94.34,98.28
     this other knee up. Again, this is the unaffected side that we're going to stretch
},
{
    98.28,102.14
     first. Um, cause a lot of times a pinch of nerve in the lower back,
},
{
    102.36,102.78
     it's,
},
{
    102.78,108.08
     it's best to test the waters on the other side of the body when you're doing the stretch rather than just jump into the water too much
},
{
    108.08,109.08
     on that side.
},
{
    109.08,117.92
     So I like to bring the shin or the ankle or foot up the shin here on this side to kind
},
{
    117.92,119.4
     of set it in place first.
},
{
    119.4,123.04
     What we're going to do is we're going to take with these hands and first we're going to
},
{
    123.04,128.48
     stretch a little bit across the body this way while we're stretching the piriformis and you get a little
},
{
    128.48,133.84
     bit of the hamstring in this area too and you hold for five seconds and then we're going to slowly
},
{
    133.84,140.48
     reverse that position and go put a stretch into the other range. This tends to feel really good
},
{
    140.48,145.68
     for a lot of people especially on the side of symptoms. So hold for five seconds,
},
{
    145.68,152.72
     breathe deep in the nose, out the mouth, and return back to the first stretch position,
},
{
    152.72,157.92
     which is diagonally across the body. Notice my back is flat on the ground during this exercise,
},
{
    158.96,163.36
     or this stretch, and I'm not really doing anything in regards to looking up. Just relaxing.
},
{
    163.92,170.1
     Make sure you're breathing in the nose, out the mouth. Now keep in mind I know these first two
},
{
    170.1,174.64
     stretches are pretty good but in the very end or the the last two stretches I
},
{
    174.64,178.72
     think are the very best so hang along hang on for those stretches. We're going
},
{
    178.72,184.84
     to do the other side here and first again pulling across the body, test the
},
{
    184.84,185.48
     water.
},
{
    185.48,186.88
     Does it send pain down the leg?
},
{
    186.88,190.16
     If it doesn't, it's usually okay to do.
},
{
    190.16,193.76
     Deep breath in the nose, out the mouth.
},
{
    193.76,197.28
     This really resets the nervous system and really helps everything kind of calm down
},
{
    197.28,198.72
     during the stretch.
},
{
    198.72,202.52
     And then we're going to spend another five seconds into the push downward position.
},
{
    202.52,207.92
     Again, he's had something like a hip replacement. This might not be a good one for you because it would challenge the
},
{
    207.92,214.08
     prosthesis. Up for five seconds, breathing. Again, I can't because I'm
},
{
    214.08,218.92
     speaking. And then pushing. Okay, stretch both directions. You might find one is
},
{
    218.92,222.8
     more favorable to you than the other. Now, the next two I think are the best, the
},
{
    222.8,225.28
     absolute best exercises for a lot
},
{
    225.28,231.16
     of people, especially younger people that are dealing with sciatic or a pinched nerve
},
{
    231.16,237.48
     in the lower back. By the way, a pinched nerve in the lower back or leg pain, it can be from
},
{
    237.48,241.64
     pressure of the nerve root or the sciatic nerve anywhere along its path. There's multiple
},
{
    241.64,245.08
     things that can create the pain or create the pressure
},
{
    245.08,246.52
     of the pinched nerve.
},
{
    246.52,250.68
     And so keep in mind that some of these stretches that I'm showing you are good for ones but
},
{
    250.68,253.72
     not the one reason for a pinch but not the other.
},
{
    253.72,259.68
     A lot of the common things is foraminal encroachment, disc herniations, pure form of syndrome or
},
{
    259.68,260.96
     even double crush syndrome.
},
{
    260.96,264.52
     All these have a little bit, they're a little bit different stretch recommendations.
},
{
    264.52,268.48
     So just make sure that you really know what's going on in your body first.
},
{
    268.48,273.16
     So this, this third one, this third stretch is just hanging out onto your belly until
},
{
    273.16,277.6
     I like to call the on the beach book reading position. You just relax and reading the book,
},
{
    277.6,289.44
     getting some sun and just hanging. Breathe deep into the sand. Again, in the nose, out the mouth. Imagine you have that book in your
},
{
    289.44,294.28
     hand and you're trying to blow the pages. I'm really focusing on the breath with you
},
{
    294.28,298.72
     guys because really the breathing is a very important part of it. People tend to breeze
},
{
    298.72,302.84
     right by it. It's one of the easiest wins in the book, especially out of first lips
},
{
    302.84,305.12
     like it's out of a little straw.
},
{
    305.12,307.64
     Hold this position for about 30 seconds,
},
{
    307.64,309.92
     and then act like there's a sand dune right there,
},
{
    309.92,312.36
     and you just wanna kinda see over to see what's going on.
},
{
    312.36,315.56
     But use your arms to do so, don't use your back.
},
{
    315.56,318.16
     And you're like, oh, yep, there's waves out there, cool.
},
{
    318.16,320.8
     All right, I'm gonna go down and just take a second.
},
{
    320.8,322.36
     I'm gonna hang out here, read that book.
},
{
    322.36,325.42
     I got in there maybe a couple sentences in that paragraph.
},
{
    325.42,327.46
     Then you're like, you know what?
},
{
    327.46,329.94
     Are the ways big enough for me?
},
{
    329.94,330.5
     Nope.
},
{
    330.5,331.86
     It's not big enough.
},
{
    331.86,333.3
     You're going to relax just like that,
},
{
    333.3,335.26
     reading the couple lines.
},
{
    335.26,336.5
     And check it.
},
{
    336.5,338.78
     So usually, I have people do about 10 to 20 of these
},
{
    338.78,339.7
     just to see.
},
{
    339.7,342.14
     And I just tend to see how far they can get.
},
{
    342.14,344.5
     What's the biggest dune you can look over?
},
{
    344.5,348.04
     And a lot of times, this will make people's leg pain feel much better.
},
{
    348.04,350.2
     Their side of the foot feels better.
},
{
    350.2,354.84
     Their back might feel a little sticky right here with it, but that's okay for most people.
},
{
    354.84,358.24
     But I like to have people do too when they're in the book reading or they look over the
},
{
    358.24,359.24
     dune's position.
},
{
    359.24,363.84
     It's eventually rocked back into this one, which is the fourth stretch for a pinch nerve
},
{
    363.84,365.12
     in the lower back, which is called a stretch for a pinched nerve in the lower back,
},
{
    371.12,376.16
     which is called a frog's pose or a child's pose. Obviously, this is not your standard yoga child's pose, but this one works really well to kind of clear space into some of the holes of the back
},
{
    376.16,382.0
     here, which sometimes can create pressure on a nerve root and create the pinching or the pressure,
},
{
    382.0,389.2
     which is creating the problem. And so again, breathing is a very pivotal point in this. So in the nose three, out the mouth,
},
{
    389.2,399.6
     into the thighs here. In the nose three, out six. Again, nice book reading position.
},
{
    399.6,404.44
     Both are book options at the beach. So usually about five reps or so of this.
},
{
    404.44,407.64
     And so if we're going gonna talk about just general programming
},
{
    407.64,409.72
     of some of these exercises when they work
},
{
    409.72,412.08
     or some of these stretches when they work is the first two.
},
{
    412.08,415.56
     Again, usually about five reps or so
},
{
    415.56,417.88
     of about 10 seconds is good enough.
},
{
    417.88,420.36
     If there's ones like this one,
},
{
    420.36,423.12
     the push pull one if we're doing five and five,
},
{
    423.12,424.24
     that's like one rep.
},
{
    424.24,427.4
     And so again, five reps total of that the press ups and
},
{
    427.4,431.36
     Or the book reading positions usually I'd spend about 20 reps
},
{
    431.36,438.0
     Which equates about usually about a minute and a half kind of exploring those positions you might be surprised that one of them actually
},
{
    438.8,442.74
     Feels pretty good now if you're looking for help with this again
},
{
    442.74,449.32
     We're hunting some beats we do a very good job with sciatica, pinch nerves in the back, disc herniations, hip
},
{
    449.32,453.12
     and pinchment, and even stuff out into the groin or stuff that you've been experiencing
},
{
    453.12,454.6
     down into the thigh.
},
{
    454.6,457.72
     These are very simple to treat.
},
{
    457.72,461.76
     They just take a little bit of work on your guys' part and we just do the job to direct
},
{
    461.76,462.76
     you.
},
{
    462.76,463.76
     So, again, we're in Huntington Beach.
},
{
    463.76,465.38
     We do help people virtually.
},
{
    465.38,471.06
     And by that, I mean, just message us, whether this be on Instagram or YouTube, just message
},
{
    471.06,472.06
     us directly.
},
{
    472.06,475.7
     We do our best to send everybody to where they need to go.
},
{
    475.7,479.5
     If you're in Kansas somewhere and you're like, look, I don't have anyone around me.
},
{
    479.5,481.5
     And you know, we might know someone there.
},
{
    481.5,482.5
     Okay.
},
{
    482.5,483.5
     It's a small world.
},
{
    483.5,485.72
     So hopefully we can direct you somewhere where you need to go,
},
{
    485.72,487.52
     or maybe we have a lot of the free videos
},
{
    487.52,489.76
     on Instagram and YouTube that maybe are good resources
},
{
    489.76,492.36
     for you guys, so all you have to do is ask, okay?
},
{
    492.36,494.4
     Just start the conversation, please ask.
},
{
    494.4,497.0
     We encourage everybody to first reach out to us
},
{
    497.0,498.4
     with messaging.
},
{
    498.4,501.16
     Second is we just do an email, okay?
},
{
    501.16,503.96
     A lot of times the private conversation is better
},
{
    503.96,508.22
     for your guys' direction versus feeling like we're having a shout over other people
},
{
    508.22,512.08
     commenting in on stuff we're talking about on social media or YouTube. So just
},
{
    512.08,518.12
     email us. It's info at p2sportscare.com. Again info at p2sportscare.com or
},
{
    518.12,522.64
     just call us. We're not quick to get the phone. Email is better but a phone
},
{
    522.64,526.66
     number is 714-502-4243 and we can set up a
},
{
    526.66,528.02
     call and talk then.
},
{
    528.02,532.58
     Subscribe and like to the channel and tell me which exercise was your favorite.
},
{
    532.58,536.88
     I'd love to hear about it in the comment boxes so I'll talk to you guys next week and I
},
{
    536.88,541.3
     look forward to showing you more stretches and exercises for things like pinched nerve
},
{
    541.3,542.54
     and lower back every week.
},
