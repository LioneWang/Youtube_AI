     Baby, you're trying to run further or faster.
},
{
    6.08,7.92
     What if I told you I could make you run better?
},
{
    7.92,13.52
     Let me show you how to improve your running form.
},
{
    13.52,15.32
     Okay.
},
{
    15.32,23.4
     Hey, free havers.
},
{
    23.4,24.4
     Welcome back to the channel.
},
{
    24.4,26.56
     Thanks for joining us. Dr. Lauren Linus.
},
{
    26.56,30.74
     And today I want to show you some of my favorite exercises to help to improve your running
},
{
    30.74,35.12
     form. Now we know that with running form, we want to improve efficiency, which means
},
{
    35.12,39.2
     we really want to work on number one, strengthening the muscles that assist with running. And
},
{
    39.2,44.48
     then number two, improving the motor patterns that we use to run. So before we get started,
},
{
    44.48,46.04
     I want you to do yourself a favor.
},
{
    46.04,48.32
     Go ahead, click subscribe right now.
},
{
    48.32,49.36
     And then hit that bell too,
},
{
    49.36,51.04
     so you get more notifications
},
{
    51.04,52.84
     of when we put out other awesome videos.
},
{
    52.84,54.52
     But let's get started.
},
{
    54.52,56.84
     So one of the exercises that we wanna start with
},
{
    56.84,59.24
     is working on strengthening our feet muscles
},
{
    59.24,62.54
     and just our lower extremity in a single leg position.
},
{
    62.54,64.16
     So Pogo hops are a good way to do that.
},
{
    64.16,69.28
     You're gonna start on one leg and then we're going to just get up on the toe. Okay, quick, quick,
},
{
    69.28,74.32
     quick, quick. Now, this is a great exercise to improve proprioceptive awareness, which means that
},
{
    74.32,79.04
     our brain knows where our body is in space. So, if you're a big trail runner, right, this is a good
},
{
    79.04,86.96
     way to work on improving knowing where our foot is in space. This is also a good exercise to work on improving
},
{
    86.96,89.04
     both the dorsiflexors and the plantar flexors.
},
{
    89.04,91.28
     So pushing down and then coming up.
},
{
    91.28,94.36
     Okay, really important muscles for running.
},
{
    94.36,95.88
     Now the great thing about this exercise
},
{
    95.88,99.48
     is that we can go a normal pace, we can pick it up.
},
{
    99.48,102.28
     Right, we can go slow, really absorb
},
{
    102.28,104.0
     into the knee and the foot.
},
{
    104.0,106.24
     But I would encourage you to try 30 to 50 of these
},
{
    107.44,113.36
     on one leg and then switch. Okay, exercise number one. Again, efficiency comes with improving
},
{
    113.36,118.16
     strength through our legs in that single leg position. That's a great way to do it. Next
},
{
    118.16,126.88
     exercise, come on over here, join me at the wall. Okay, something that we often see in runners when they become fatigued is they start leaning back.
},
{
    126.88,132.16
     Now this can be because of laziness in the glute muscles. Again, it can be because of fatigue,
},
{
    132.16,136.12
     but something we want to work on with running is just a nice comfortable lean forward. And this
},
{
    136.12,146.08
     is a good way to work on that. So here we're gonna start with one leg up and then we're gonna do a quick exchange. There's a car coming in.
},
{
    146.08,155.64
     We're gonna do that next one. Okay, take two. Okay, so something that we also want to work
},
{
    155.64,159.94
     on with running is improving our forward trunk lean. A lot of times you see with fatigue
},
{
    159.94,164.52
     or what we call kind of glute laziness is people leaning back when they run. No, we
},
{
    164.52,166.76
     want to work on just a nice, comfortable forward lean.
},
{
    166.76,168.72
     So, out of wall, this can be a wall.
},
{
    168.72,170.12
     I've had my runners do that.
},
{
    170.12,172.24
     Stop signs, maybe the hood of their car.
},
{
    172.24,174.48
     Okay, we're gonna start in that runners ready position.
},
{
    174.48,177.52
     From here, we're gonna do a quick exchange,
},
{
    177.52,180.32
     bringing that stance leg up and then switching.
},
{
    180.32,183.56
     Okay, this is also a good way to work on improving
},
{
    183.56,186.48
     where our leg falls in regards to our body with running.
},
{
    186.48,192.5
     A lot of times we see injuries with over striding, which means we get our foot farther in front of our base of support
},
{
    192.5,198.16
     than it should be when we run. Now an angle of more than about 10 degrees between the bottom of my foot and that floor
},
{
    198.44,201.02
     leads to an increased chance of injury.
},
{
    201.02,205.08
     So this is also a great exercise to work on getting that leg right
},
{
    205.08,210.8
     under our body when we run, which translates nicely right to hear that running form. And
},
{
    210.8,215.2
     this will help to decrease your chance of injury. So I encourage you to try 20 to 30
},
{
    215.2,220.04
     exchanges here. Quick, light on the feet. Okay. My last exercise I want to take you
},
{
    220.04,230.4
     guys through. Maybe you've been told before that you cross over a little bit when you run. Okay, I call it sometimes scissor rain when we're running. So in order to correct
},
{
    230.4,234.12
     that, I want hands out in front of you. Okay, you're going to find a line. So I'm going
},
{
    234.12,237.0
     to use this line right here. You're going to find a line. And then what I want you to
},
{
    237.0,242.48
     do, keep your hands right over that line. Practice just marching, getting your legs
},
{
    242.48,248.8
     to fall right under your hips. Okay, and without letting your legs kind of cross over.
},
{
    248.8,252.96
     Now this will feel difficult if you are one of those individuals who when they run they
},
{
    252.96,254.52
     kind of do this type of motion.
},
{
    254.52,259.72
     Now I'm exaggerating, but we know that individuals who have kind of that crossover gait, a lot
},
{
    259.72,263.06
     of times will develop IT band pain, maybe knee pain.
},
{
    263.06,264.72
     So this is a great exercise to try.
},
{
    264.72,265.36
     And I encourage
},
{
    265.36,270.72
     you to practice it for 15 to 20 feet. Okay, just retrain that motor pattern again. Do you come a
},
{
    270.72,274.96
     more efficient runner working on number one, strengthening those muscles, and then number two,
},
{
    274.96,280.08
     improving form can be a really, really good way to become a more efficient runner. Now,
},
{
    281.68,285.94
     again, strengthening is really important. We have a really awesome video that shows you five
},
{
    285.94,288.22
     of our favorite strengthening exercises.
},
{
    288.22,289.58
     You can find that here.
},
{
    289.58,291.68
     And then we also have a phenomenal
},
{
    291.68,294.36
     pre-hab running program that you can find
},
{
    294.36,295.2
     right on over here.
},
{
    295.2,298.48
     Check it out if you're looking to up your running game.
},
{
    298.48,299.84
     Otherwise, it's hot in LA today.
},
{
    299.84,301.2
     So I'm gonna go grab some water.
},
{
    301.2,305.0
     I'll see you guys out in the track. ["Snow White"]
