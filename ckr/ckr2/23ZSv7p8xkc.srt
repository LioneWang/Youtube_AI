     Hey guys, Dr. Christy Ennis.
},
{
    2.6,8.68
     Today I am going to show you how to get rid of those knots in your neck, your shoulders,
},
{
    8.68,9.68
     and your upper back.
},
{
    9.68,13.84
     So some really quick stretches that you can do throughout the day to get rid of those
},
{
    13.84,17.68
     things that are caused when we're sitting and driving and all that fun, wonderful stuff
},
{
    17.68,20.08
     that we have to do during the day for work.
},
{
    20.08,27.8
     So number one, you can do these sitting or you can do them standing, but if you take that chin and tuck it back
},
{
    28.72,31.76
     and you're gonna do this several times throughout the day,
},
{
    31.76,34.96
     you're going to help relieve tension in through here
},
{
    34.96,37.24
     and work on those stabilizing muscles through the front.
},
{
    37.24,39.32
     So get rid of those knots back there.
},
{
    39.32,40.36
     So that's number one.
},
{
    40.36,42.88
     Number two is taking those shoulder blades
},
{
    42.88,49.9
     and gently squeezing them together, thinking about almost like you're lengthening your collarbone. So don't or you're gonna tighten up your neck
},
{
    49.9,53.98
     It's nice and gentle and same idea five or six or so
},
{
    54.7,56.7
     continuously throughout the day
},
{
    57.78,62.38
     Next if you have pain, let's say you have pain on this side of the neck
},
{
    63.14,66.44
     If you do that little chin tuck and then keep
},
{
    66.44,71.8
     that chin tuck and a little tilt and come back. So you're tilting to the side of
},
{
    71.8,78.48
     pain. That actually should get a little bit better and you're gonna do again
},
{
    78.48,82.76
     somewhere between five or ten repetitions and multiple times during the
},
{
    82.76,85.08
     day. Remember it's to the side that hurts,
},
{
    85.08,88.08
     so you don't necessarily have to do it to both sides.
},
{
    88.08,89.84
     So another place that people get tension
},
{
    89.84,91.12
     is right back in here.
},
{
    91.12,94.04
     Sometimes those headaches will come all the way up.
},
{
    94.04,96.16
     So if you take a little hand towel,
},
{
    96.16,100.64
     place it right where the bumps in the back of that head are,
},
{
    100.64,104.16
     and then give a little pull and extend up.
},
{
    104.16,107.4
     So notice I'm kind of pulling up with those elbows.
},
{
    107.4,110.76
     You should go, ah, that feels so good.
},
{
    110.76,115.76
     And again, same principle, five to 10, several times a day.
},
{
    115.8,116.84
     Nice and gentle.
},
{
    116.84,119.64
     All of this is nice and gentle, nothing vicious here.
},
{
    120.56,124.68
     If you are limited moving to one side or another
},
{
    124.68,127.76
     with that neck, for example, if I go to turn
},
{
    127.76,132.88
     my head or tilt my head to the right and it just gets stuck here, it just doesn't want
},
{
    132.88,136.92
     to go, you can do what's called an isometric contraction.
},
{
    136.92,141.08
     So your hand is going to push one way, your head is going to push the other way, and you're
},
{
    141.08,143.36
     actually not going to move, it's just a posing force.
},
{
    143.36,147.74
     So I'm going to go as far as I can in one direction without pain. My hand's
},
{
    147.74,152.2
     going to push that way. My head is going to push against it gently. That's key.
},
{
    152.2,157.56
     Gently for about five seconds or so and then let go and see if you can get a
},
{
    157.56,162.16
     little bit more motion and you're actually going to do that three to four
},
{
    162.16,166.72
     times. So push, hold and breathe. Don't forget the breathing fight.
},
{
    167.28,171.6
     And then let it go and see if you get a little bit more emotion. Again, don't push through pain
},
{
    171.6,177.28
     in any of these. These are to help you loosen and feel better, not to feel worse. So don't ever go
},
{
    177.28,185.84
     beyond your comfortable range of motion. Okay. And then one more that you can do seated in your fabulous office chair like
},
{
    185.84,191.64
     I have. As long as the chair doesn't go up too far, if you cross those arms here or if
},
{
    191.64,196.6
     it's more comfortable here, and then go ahead and let yourself actually extend over that
},
{
    196.6,201.8
     chair and there I go pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. And that feels so good. Again, not pain, but
},
{
    201.8,207.42
     trying to open up that chest, get rid of some of those knots that tend to be in the middle of that spine.
},
{
    207.42,211.68
     So those are all easy, super-duper easy ones that you can do right in your office.
},
{
    211.68,216.64
     Now, the next ones require a tennis ball and a fabulous sock.
},
{
    216.64,220.92
     It doesn't have to be this beautiful turtle sock, but of course it would help.
},
{
    220.92,226.6
     So the first one is going to be with one ball right in that sock. And the
},
{
    226.6,230.76
     reason it's in the sock is because it's just a little bit easier to hold instead of trying
},
{
    230.76,236.12
     to wiggle yourself. So you're going to over one shoulder and then you're going to go ahead
},
{
    236.12,240.52
     and go against that wall so that you can actually hold on to it right with that sock. So it
},
{
    240.52,245.28
     obviously needs to be a sock that is a little stretched out. Nylons work too.
},
{
    245.28,247.84
     I obviously don't wear this turtle sock anymore.
},
{
    247.84,251.76
     And then you're just kind of going back and forth over those sore tight spots until you
},
{
    251.76,254.84
     go, hey, that's not as tight anymore.
},
{
    254.84,257.32
     And that should feel again good, not painful.
},
{
    257.32,260.44
     That's why actually doing it on the wall is better than doing it on the floor because
},
{
    260.44,262.4
     it's a little less pressure.
},
{
    262.4,265.6
     And then you can take two tennis balls,
},
{
    265.6,267.52
     and again in that sock,
},
{
    267.52,271.08
     probably tying a little knot in the end of that sock.
},
{
    271.08,273.96
     And then the tennis balls are gonna go on
},
{
    273.96,275.16
     either side of the spine,
},
{
    275.16,278.28
     so little tiny space there against the wall.
},
{
    278.28,280.08
     I call this bear scratching his back,
},
{
    280.08,281.84
     because that's exactly what it looks like.
},
{
    281.84,283.04
     You're just gonna go up and down.
},
{
    283.04,286.6
     So now we're getting those muscles right alongside the spine.
},
{
    286.6,289.48
     Looks kind of funny, but it feels really good.
},
{
    289.48,291.8
     And then one last one.
},
{
    291.8,293.72
     So for this one, you're gonna get down on the ground
},
{
    293.72,295.8
     and you're gonna take that same towel.
},
{
    295.8,298.96
     You're gonna try to roll it up as tight as you can
},
{
    298.96,300.6
     because we're gonna actually use this
},
{
    300.6,302.92
     on the spine a little bit.
},
{
    302.92,306.12
     So the way this is going to work, if I can get down on
},
{
    306.12,312.84
     the ground, step one, this is going to go right beside the spine. Okay, so we're going
},
{
    312.84,317.96
     to lie down on our back. Excuse me. No, we're going to lie on our side. This is tucked in
},
{
    317.96,325.86
     by that spine. Bring that top knee up, hold it down with that bottom arm, and then as you roll over, you're actually
},
{
    325.86,329.34
     rolling over that rolled up towel.
},
{
    329.34,333.34
     So now we're getting into the muscles and you're getting into the joints a little bit,
},
{
    333.34,335.8
     just like when you were sitting in that chair.
},
{
    335.8,340.1
     Let the head go with it as long as it feels okay, really trying to keep this knee down.
},
{
    340.1,343.42
     And again, about 10 repetitions or so.
},
{
    343.42,347.16
     You do need to make sure that that towel is rolled up pretty firm to do it, otherwise
},
{
    347.16,348.76
     it doesn't work very well.
},
{
    348.76,353.48
     You can do it without the towel and just get some nice rotation and movement, but you won't
},
{
    353.48,358.0
     have the same effect into the spine, obviously, as if you use the towel.
},
{
    358.0,363.32
     So those are some quick, easy stretches that you can do throughout the day to really help
},
{
    363.32,369.0
     get rid of some of those knots that tend to build up from work, driving, stress as we all start to
},
{
    369.0,374.08
     do this. So thank you for tuning in today. Go ahead and click that thumbs up button
},
{
    374.08,376.86
     if you liked it. Share it with any family or friends that you think might
},
{
    376.86,383.4
     benefit from this and stay tuned for more information. Thanks!
