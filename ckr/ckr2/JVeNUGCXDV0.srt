     In this video, I'm going to show you how to relieve heel pain in seconds.
},
{
    3.68,4.68
     Stay tuned.
},
{
    4.68,13.2
     Hey, everyone, Dr. O coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan.
},
{
    13.2,17.2
     In this video, I'm going to show you a step-by-step guide that are going to go over stretching
},
{
    17.2,22.52
     and strengthening exercises to give quick heel pain relief, even in as little as 30
},
{
    22.52,23.52
     seconds.
},
{
    23.52,25.36
     All of these exercises can be done at home.
},
{
    25.36,28.84
     They're very easy and effective and don't require any special equipment.
},
{
    28.84,32.8
     The only thing that I'm going to be using in one of the exercises is an everyday tennis
},
{
    32.8,33.8
     ball.
},
{
    33.8,36.48
     So, let's get started and get rid of that heel pain right now.
},
{
    36.48,41.2
     In this part, we're going to focus on a big cause of heel pain, which is soft tissue tightness,
},
{
    41.2,43.12
     notably plantar fasciitis.
},
{
    43.12,46.28
     This is known as Gua Sha and it might become your new favorite exercise.
},
{
    46.28,47.28
     We need two things.
},
{
    47.28,49.28
     The first being a form of lubrication.
},
{
    49.28,53.12
     I'm going to be using coconut oil, but you can use any over the counter pain cream such
},
{
    53.12,56.92
     as icy hot or bio freeze or any massage lotions.
},
{
    56.92,59.92
     Start off by coating this whole area also with our lubrication.
},
{
    59.92,62.96
     When it comes to lubrication, we want as much as possible.
},
{
    62.96,64.76
     That way, we don't have any friction.
},
{
    64.76,67.92
     The second thing that we need is a large metal spoon.
},
{
    67.92,69.92
     One with a little bit more thickness towards it.
},
{
    69.92,71.4
     You'll get a little bit better result.
},
{
    71.4,76.0
     So after we put our lubrication on, what I'm going to do is start at my heel right here.
},
{
    76.0,78.16
     It doesn't matter what part of the spoon you use.
},
{
    78.16,79.92
     You can use the rounded portion or the handle.
},
{
    79.92,83.84
     I like to use the handle, but I'm just going to start right at the heel on the outside and
},
{
    83.84,87.62
     then just do nice, slow strokes like this downward.
},
{
    87.62,90.74
     Put enough pressure in there where you feel like you're getting this nice self-massage
},
{
    90.74,93.08
     but not causing any irritation.
},
{
    93.08,98.26
     If you do have heel spurs or a lot of heel pain, this can become very tender, so slowly
},
{
    98.26,99.88
     build into it.
},
{
    99.88,103.2
     Try not to cause any discomfort with it.
},
{
    103.2,105.2
     But I want to do nice, slow strokes.
},
{
    105.2,109.28
     I just go at it pretty much from the heel down towards the toes.
},
{
    109.28,111.32
     I do this for about five times.
},
{
    111.32,115.64
     Then I just simply switch over towards the middle a little bit until I go from the outside
},
{
    115.64,118.16
     of the heel all the way towards the other side.
},
{
    118.16,122.08
     I focus on areas that just need it a little bit more.
},
{
    122.08,125.72
     From there, I start to work down into the arch of the foot doing the same thing.
},
{
    125.72,130.32
     I go on the inside of the foot right here five times and then I start to move inwards
},
{
    130.32,131.32
     with it.
},
{
    131.32,134.24
     When you do this also, and I don't know if you can kind of see it right here on the
},
{
    134.24,139.32
     video, you might start to get little pockets of redness starting to form at the foot or
},
{
    139.32,140.84
     I should say at the top of the skin.
},
{
    140.84,143.8
     That's blood flow coming into the area which is a good thing.
},
{
    143.8,147.92
     It helps promote healing. When you do this also you might feel that there's a
},
{
    147.92,151.76
     spot that just feels really gritty almost like sandpaper. That's a spot of
},
{
    151.76,154.9
     ahesion and that's the spot that we want to focus on a little bit more so
},
{
    154.9,159.04
     really focus on trying to put as much pressure in there and working into that
},
{
    159.04,163.36
     grittiness to help break it up because it might lead to more heel pain or
},
{
    163.36,168.4
     plantar fasciitis relief. But you want to do this all over the foot right here pretty much from the heel all
},
{
    168.4,174.4
     the way to the toes themselves and stop and focus on spots that feel very tight
},
{
    174.4,178.56
     and achy and throw more repetitions in there to get it to self-release hopefully
},
{
    178.56,183.4
     leading to a lot of plantar fasciitis relief and heel pain relief. Once we're
},
{
    183.4,186.04
     done with that and we've gone over the whole foot itself,
},
{
    186.04,188.48
     try to focus a little bit more around the ankle
},
{
    188.48,190.32
     and on the outside of the foot right here.
},
{
    190.32,191.24
     On the top of the foot,
},
{
    191.24,192.98
     you can go very lightly with it too,
},
{
    192.98,196.16
     but I try to stay off any really bony spots.
},
{
    196.16,198.0
     Like there's a really big bony spot right here.
},
{
    198.0,200.54
     If you have a bunion, you definitely don't want to do this.
},
{
    200.54,202.68
     Or you don't really want to go over the malleolus
},
{
    202.68,203.88
     of the ankle right here either
},
{
    203.88,205.32
     because it can cause irritation. Really just focus on soft tissue with it. Once we're done want to go over the maleolus of the ankle right here either because it can cause irritation.
},
{
    205.32,207.76
     Really just focus on soft tissue with it.
},
{
    207.76,209.92
     Once we're done pretty much going over the foot
},
{
    209.92,211.92
     and the ankle itself, let's do a little bit more
},
{
    211.92,214.38
     for the Achilles and the calf muscle.
},
{
    214.38,216.44
     So I'm just gonna take the spoon right here
},
{
    216.44,218.08
     and I'm going to start at the top of the calf
},
{
    218.08,220.36
     and I'm just going to trace down from the top
},
{
    220.36,222.52
     all the way down towards the ankle like this
},
{
    222.52,223.36
     over the Achilles.
},
{
    223.36,224.72
     Nice, slow strokes.
},
{
    224.72,226.94
     And you wanna do this one for about five times,
},
{
    226.94,229.68
     switch over to the middle, and then repeat this
},
{
    229.68,232.08
     till you hit the complete calf muscle.
},
{
    232.08,234.44
     You want to really target the Achilles right here too,
},
{
    234.44,237.04
     because a lot of tightness can build in there
},
{
    237.04,239.04
     and repeat over areas that you feel
},
{
    239.04,240.8
     need it just a little bit more.
},
{
    240.8,242.52
     Let's go through some ankle motions too.
},
{
    242.52,244.16
     So bring the toes back like this.
},
{
    244.16,247.88
     This is going to activate the muscle just a little bit differently and then just simply repeat
},
{
    247.88,252.36
     this. Then you can also take the toes away from you and do the same thing. You can also
},
{
    252.36,256.7
     go in with the leg. You can also go out with the foot, I should say, like this. You can
},
{
    256.7,262.56
     also go into supination. You can go into pronation because this is all going to activate the
},
{
    262.56,265.4
     Achilles right here in the calf muscle just a little bit differently.
},
{
    265.4,270.28
     But go through all of those motions and focus on tightness, the aghesions that you feel
},
{
    270.28,274.84
     that grittiness and throw more repetitions in there to hopefully lead to a lot less tension
},
{
    274.84,276.42
     and more heel pain relief.
},
{
    276.42,282.32
     This is one of my personal favorite heel pain exercises because it's very easy to do but
},
{
    282.32,283.72
     really effective.
},
{
    283.72,285.58
     I need a tennis ball for this one.
},
{
    285.58,286.7
     If you don't have a tennis ball,
},
{
    286.7,289.86
     you can also use a water bottle or a rolled up towel.
},
{
    289.86,292.18
     I'm also going to go next to a door frame.
},
{
    292.18,293.54
     This is a two part motion.
},
{
    293.54,295.78
     In the first part, I'm just going to place the tennis ball
},
{
    295.78,297.78
     over a spot on the bottom of the foot
},
{
    297.78,299.7
     that feels like it's very tender and achy.
},
{
    299.7,301.38
     Let's say it's right here for me.
},
{
    301.38,304.22
     I'm going to then press down into that tennis ball
},
{
    304.22,308.34
     with my body weight till I feel a very comfortable amount of pressure. The
},
{
    308.34,312.54
     second part I'm going to take my big toe, place it next to the door frame, and
},
{
    312.54,316.46
     then I'm going to take my knee and then lean forward like this into the door
},
{
    316.46,321.5
     frame. This will cause the bottom of the foot to get a really, really deep stretch.
},
{
    321.5,328.08
     So really challenge yourself to go forward as much as you can, while at the same time pressing down into the tennis ball.
},
{
    328.08,329.36
     Once we hit that point,
},
{
    329.36,331.36
     let's hold this for 20 seconds.
},
{
    331.36,333.24
     From there, you're just going to relax,
},
{
    333.24,334.3
     take a breather,
},
{
    334.3,336.42
     and then repeat this up to five times.
},
{
    336.42,337.46
     With each repetition,
},
{
    337.46,338.56
     always challenge yourself.
},
{
    338.56,340.44
     Stretch more into it by leaning forward,
},
{
    340.44,341.72
     pressing down into the ball
},
{
    341.72,343.96
     to get a little bit more of a self-massage,
},
{
    343.96,345.96
     self-release into that area.
},
{
    345.96,349.68
     From there, you can switch the tennis ball over different spots as needed.
},
{
    349.68,352.48
     And I would recommend going over the complete bottom of the foot.
},
{
    352.48,357.76
     Get it completely loosened up because at that point, it may lead to a lot less issues of
},
{
    357.76,359.52
     future heel pain.
},
{
    359.52,364.9
     So here's a great way to target plantar fasciitis pain and heel pain in a seated position.
},
{
    364.9,365.6
     This is known as
},
{
    365.6,369.68
     the chair circuit. It's a three-part exercise that's really going to deal with the arch of the foot,
},
{
    369.68,375.6
     the metatarsals that may lead to plantar fasciitis, heel pain, heel spurs. The first part, I'm going
},
{
    375.6,380.72
     to do a simple foot twist. Think of a towel in between my hands. I'm going to do a ring motion
},
{
    380.72,384.96
     like this. So my hands are going to go in opposite directions. Let's take the webbing of the hand
},
{
    384.96,387.52
     right here, place it right below the ankle.
},
{
    387.52,389.48
     I'm going to do the same with the other hand.
},
{
    389.48,394.24
     You want to clamp into the foot as much as you can and then start to put in very good
},
{
    394.24,396.44
     motion only to your comfort level.
},
{
    396.44,401.28
     Really focus on trying to stretch this area out as much as you can.
},
{
    401.28,409.78
     You want to do this for about five seconds, move down just a little bit, and then repeat this over and over again until you get to the bottom of the foot right here
},
{
    409.78,414.8
     below the toes. You can also take this at a different angle. Take your hand right here,
},
{
    414.8,418.32
     place it on top, take the other hand, place it at the bottom, and do the same thing. It's
},
{
    418.32,422.4
     just going to target it a little bit differently, and you might find it's more effective. Go
},
{
    422.4,428.74
     with what is most effective. If you do feel like one spot, like let's say right here, it's just very tight and
},
{
    428.74,434.44
     anky for me, I try to throw some more repetitions in there until I finally get it to release.
},
{
    434.44,438.68
     In the second part, let's focus a little bit more on dropped and raised metatarsals.
},
{
    438.68,441.56
     Right here, the metatarsals run in the middle of the foot.
},
{
    441.56,446.14
     So this can cause a lot of irritation to the plantar fascia, which may start to lead to
},
{
    446.14,450.44
     issues like heel spurs and heel pain plantar fasciitis.
},
{
    450.44,454.96
     I'm going to go and I'm going to take my hands like this and stabilize the back of the foot.
},
{
    454.96,459.48
     I'm going to then take my fingers right here and start right below the big toe here.
},
{
    459.48,460.76
     I'm going to trace it down.
},
{
    460.76,464.14
     If you just take your thumb and go like this, you're going to feel a very long bone that
},
{
    464.14,467.52
     runs right through here. That's that metatarsal that we're looking for.
},
{
    467.52,471.92
     So I'm just going to start at the top and then I'm going to press into it just like
},
{
    471.92,477.04
     this very slowly. And let's just keep doing this and tracing that long bone all the way
},
{
    477.04,483.4
     down like this. This can also become very, very tender. So only go to your comfort level
},
{
    483.4,485.88
     but challenge yourself to put as much pressure in there,
},
{
    485.88,487.76
     to put as much mobility as possible
},
{
    487.76,489.36
     to help loosen that up.
},
{
    489.36,490.52
     But you just wanna go down with it
},
{
    490.52,492.92
     and then come back up in very slow cycles.
},
{
    492.92,494.92
     It should take you about five seconds to go down,
},
{
    494.92,496.36
     five seconds to come back up,
},
{
    496.36,498.14
     and do this about three to five times.
},
{
    498.14,499.4
     From there, just switch over
},
{
    499.4,501.24
     and do the same thing on the next one
},
{
    501.24,503.0
     until you go all the way down
},
{
    503.0,504.84
     to your pinky toe like this.
},
{
    504.84,508.88
     If you do find that one spot is just really sore and achy, stop right there, throw some
},
{
    508.88,510.28
     more repetitions in.
},
{
    510.28,515.64
     Again, with this one, you might get a sudden pop, crack, or self-release into that bone
},
{
    515.64,519.56
     because it is out of place and you are essentially resetting it.
},
{
    519.56,522.88
     Let's next focus more on top of the foot right here.
},
{
    522.88,523.88
     I'm just going to take my hand.
},
{
    523.88,527.88
     I'm going to stabilize right here below and then I'm going to take the other hand, the
},
{
    527.88,531.36
     midi portion, and start right on the top here.
},
{
    531.36,535.76
     The motion is very similar to what we just did, but I'm going to press into it like this.
},
{
    535.76,540.04
     So I'm going from the up to the down portion, I should say, top to bottom.
},
{
    540.04,544.52
     And then I'm just going to press into it very slowly like this, and do the same thing.
},
{
    544.52,546.48
     Go down with it, and then come back up. And then you're going to do this on pretty slowly like this and do the same thing. Go down with it and then come back up.
},
{
    546.48,549.76
     And then you're going to do this on pretty much the top of the foot all the way down
},
{
    549.76,555.04
     to the pinky toe, repeating where you feel like it needs it the most.
},
{
    555.04,558.08
     And the third part, what I'm going to do is what is known as a toe spreader.
},
{
    558.08,561.48
     So I'm going to take my fingers, I'm going to just kind of put them in between the toes
},
{
    561.48,563.12
     just like this.
},
{
    563.12,566.2
     And I'm going to take the other hand and stabilize at the heel.
},
{
    566.2,567.72
     The movement from here is very simple.
},
{
    567.72,570.7
     I'm going to pull back on the foot like this.
},
{
    570.7,573.28
     This is going to stretch into the planter fascia.
},
{
    573.28,576.36
     It's really going to go from here all the way down to the heel.
},
{
    576.36,580.04
     Really challenge yourself to pull that foot back as much as you can.
},
{
    580.04,581.48
     It feels really good.
},
{
    581.48,586.48
     Once you hit a very comfortable stretch, hold this one for about 15 to 20 seconds.
},
{
    586.48,591.08
     From there, relax, take a breather, and then repeat this up to five times.
},
{
    591.08,593.52
     You can also experiment with different motions.
},
{
    593.52,596.76
     You can go in with the foot, you can go out with the foot right here into pronation and
},
{
    596.76,597.76
     supination.
},
{
    597.76,600.56
     You can also take the foot down, you can take it up like this.
},
{
    600.56,604.48
     I find that it really helps to do nice circular motions because this is just going to help
},
{
    604.48,609.92
     stretch the bottom of the foot out a little bit more, which may lead to more heel pain relief.
},
{
    609.92,614.68
     Here is a great stretching and strengthening exercise for the calf muscle and the bottom
},
{
    614.68,618.92
     of the foot, the planar fascia, two big instigators of heel pain.
},
{
    618.92,622.88
     I'm going to start standing in a scissor stance just like this.
},
{
    622.88,627.04
     Whatever side that we're focusing on, take a small towel and place it underneath the toes
},
{
    627.04,627.88
     and the ball of the foot.
},
{
    627.88,630.48
     So we want the toes elevated and the foot is going to be
},
{
    630.48,633.42
     flat during this whole exercise.
},
{
    633.42,635.96
     I'm going to keep the knee locked for the first part.
},
{
    635.96,638.7
     Let's take our body weight and then just lunge forward
},
{
    638.7,640.48
     while keeping that foot flat.
},
{
    640.48,642.32
     If you need a little bit more support,
},
{
    642.32,644.4
     you can go next to a door or a wall
},
{
    644.4,646.0
     or use a chair off to the side.
},
{
    646.0,651.0
     Challenge yourself to lean forward as much as you can while again keeping that foot flat.
},
{
    651.0,655.0
     You're going to feel a great stretch into the calf muscle, into the bottom of the foot.
},
{
    655.0,659.0
     Once we hit that great stretch, let's hold this for 20 seconds.
},
{
    659.0,669.72
     From there, simply relax, take a breather, and then repeat this up to five times. With each repetition, challenge yourself to go forward even more to get a better stretch,
},
{
    669.72,672.64
     hopefully leading to a lot more heel pain relief.
},
{
    672.64,677.2
     In the second part, I'm going to bend the knee very slightly and then repeat this exercise,
},
{
    677.2,678.8
     keeping that foot flat.
},
{
    678.8,683.32
     You'll notice that this hits the calf muscle just a little bit differently, but repeat
},
{
    683.32,685.2
     this one for 20 second holds
},
{
    685.2,687.28
     for five complete repetitions.
},
{
    687.28,688.76
     And the third part, what I'm going to do
},
{
    688.76,691.44
     is focus a little bit more on strengthening.
},
{
    691.44,694.48
     And with this one, I'm just going to lift the heel up.
},
{
    694.48,695.8
     Let me actually get next to a wall
},
{
    695.8,697.2
     because this one is a little bit easier
},
{
    697.2,698.44
     to go next to a wall.
},
{
    698.44,701.4
     And I'm just going to lift my leg up like this,
},
{
    701.4,703.8
     the heel I should say while keeping my knee locked
},
{
    703.8,704.76
     and straight.
},
{
    704.76,709.2
     You're going to feel the calf muscles really get activated with this one. So challenge yourself to
},
{
    709.2,714.64
     lift, elevate that heel up as much as you can, hold this one for 10 to 15 seconds if you're able to.
},
{
    714.64,719.28
     From there, just relax, take a breather, and then repeat this one up to five times. Again,
},
{
    719.28,724.32
     challenge yourself with each repetition to lift that heel up even more to hopefully lead to more
},
{
    724.32,728.02
     strength into the calf muscle and the bottom of the foot leading to a lot less
},
{
    728.02,732.44
     issues of future heel pain. Since heel pain is usually caused by
},
{
    732.44,736.92
     inflammation such as plantar fasciitis to the bottom of the foot it's always a
},
{
    736.92,742.52
     good idea to do a nice ice massage after doing any exercises or stretches for
},
{
    742.52,745.64
     the foot. I find that using a frozen water bottle
},
{
    745.64,749.66
     works the best, but you can also use frozen golf balls. I just start off by
},
{
    749.66,752.88
     putting a little bit of pressure into that water bottle and rolling from the
},
{
    752.88,757.6
     heel all the way to the toes. Just very very slowly with it. Try to do this for
},
{
    757.6,761.6
     at least five minutes. If you feel like you can do it longer, you're more than
},
{
    761.6,768.58
     welcome to, but this right here just helps decrease inflammation into that soft tissue. You can also take it at
},
{
    768.58,774.16
     different angles like this and go inside, outside, and explore the whole area. But
},
{
    774.16,778.24
     this way it just helps calm everything down, hopefully leading to more heel pain
},
{
    778.24,781.56
     relief. If you liked the video and got a lot of relief, please show us your
