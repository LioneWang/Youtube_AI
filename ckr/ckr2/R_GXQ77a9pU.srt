     If you are experiencing a back pain and a buttock pain on one side of your body, possibly even a hip pain and a pain down the leg,
},
{
    8.7,11.7
     you might be suffering from a piriformis syndrome.
},
{
    19.0,28.08
     So your piriformis muscle is a muscle that runs from the sacrum to your hip. And the sciatic nerve, which is a muscle that starts your lower back and ends up all the
},
{
    28.08,31.84
     way down with your toes, that normally runs below the belly of the muscle.
},
{
    31.84,36.6
     Now there are three anatomical variations that can cause a compression of the sciatic
},
{
    36.6,38.42
     nerve in the piriformis muscle.
},
{
    38.42,43.28
     You can have a split nerve where half the nerve runs through the piriformis muscle,
},
{
    43.28,48.68
     they are being compressed by the muscle. You could have a split piriformis muscle whereby the nerve runs through the piriformis muscle, they were being compressed by the muscle. You could have a split piriformis muscle, where by the nerve runs through the belly of the muscle,
},
{
    48.68,52.96
     again being split, and we can have a variation where the sciatic nerve just doesn't run anywhere
},
{
    52.96,56.92
     we think it should run, and again being compressed by the belly of the piriformis muscle.
},
{
    56.92,62.44
     So I'm going to demonstrate some really effective exercises for you to stretch the piriformis muscle.
},
{
    62.44,65.28
     I'm going to start off easy and end up a bit more intense.
},
{
    65.28,71.56
     You can do this at home and it will relieve the pressure on the Celtic nerve and relieve the pressure on your back,
},
{
    71.56,77.04
     your buttocks and in your leg as well. Now as per usual this video comes with a free exercise sheet.
},
{
    77.04,82.52
     You can download the download link you can find in the description down below. Okay, let's get started.
},
{
    82.72,86.4
     So this first piriformis stretch is a relatively easy one.
},
{
    86.4,88.58
     I'm gonna give you three variations for this.
},
{
    88.58,90.8
     So I'm gonna start off demonstrating the stretch
},
{
    90.8,94.0
     on the right side, so the right piriformis muscle.
},
{
    94.0,98.08
     I'm gonna place my right ankle on my left knee.
},
{
    98.08,99.62
     Make sure my knee drops down.
},
{
    99.62,101.84
     All I'm doing now is just lean forward.
},
{
    101.84,104.86
     So you should start feeling this in the right buttocks area.
},
{
    104.86,109.12
     You could also feel it in your lower back or you could feel it in the back of your right upper leg in the
},
{
    109.12,116.4
     hamstring area. So you bend forwards. If you can't feel anything, what you can do next is you can
},
{
    116.4,121.76
     now use your right elbow to push your right knee down. So I'm pushing my right knee down and now
},
{
    121.76,125.92
     I'm leaning forwards into the stretch. Same thing, feeling your right buttocks area,
},
{
    125.92,129.88
     hip, low back, or the back of your upper leg.
},
{
    129.88,131.7
     So he pushes forward.
},
{
    131.7,133.08
     Now if you can't do anything here,
},
{
    133.08,135.16
     what you can do now is you can push his forward,
},
{
    135.16,137.8
     and now you can rotate your left shoulder
},
{
    137.8,138.92
     towards the evolved side.
},
{
    138.92,141.24
     So now rotating, turning my body,
},
{
    141.24,144.28
     and turning to the right in this case.
},
{
    144.28,150.0
     So my left shoulder comes forward and I'm holding this for about 10 seconds.
},
{
    150.0,155.0
     I repeat this between 5 and 10 times and I do this 3-4 times a day.
},
{
    155.0,158.0
     Really good strategy for your pure form of muscle seekers.
},
{
    158.0,161.0
     You can do this for example at the office in the office chair.
},
{
    161.0,170.72
     Now for the left side, what you need to do is really place your left ankle on your right knee. First of all you lean forwards, if you can't feel anything then
},
{
    170.72,177.28
     use your left elbow to push your left knee down and again you lean forwards and that
},
{
    177.28,182.0
     goes well or you can't feel anything what you do is you push it down and you rotate your
},
{
    182.0,185.76
     body towards the left side towards the involved evolved side. And again you should feel
},
{
    185.76,192.16
     this on your in your left buttocks area, left lower back or possibly even in your hip or at the back
},
{
    192.16,196.96
     of your upper leg in your hamstring area. Again same thing, so 10 repetitions,
},
{
    198.0,203.36
     5 to 10 sets and repeat this 3 to 4 times a day. So this next stretch of your piriformis is an easy
},
{
    203.36,205.48
     ish stretch. What you need to do
},
{
    205.48,209.98
     is again come close to the wall. I'm going to demonstrate again my right piriformis.
},
{
    209.98,215.58
     Left leg up against the wall, straight knee. My right ankle goes on my left knee and all
},
{
    215.58,218.88
     I'm going to do now is I'm going to bend this leg and I should feel the stretch here in
},
{
    218.88,223.62
     my right buttocks area. If I don't feel it now what I can do is I can add a bit of push,
},
{
    223.62,227.44
     add a bit of push and again you should feel the stretch in your buttocks area, your lower back might
},
{
    227.44,230.16
     even be in the back of your hamstrings.
},
{
    230.16,234.24
     Now if you can't feel this, what you can do is you grab your leg and you can pull your
},
{
    234.24,235.74
     leg towards you.
},
{
    235.74,239.04
     Now make sure you don't put your head up and get too much tension in your body, just
},
{
    239.04,241.8
     pull your leg towards you as much as you can.
},
{
    241.8,245.94
     If you can't reach your knee or you can't reach your upper
},
{
    245.94,250.66
     leg, what you can do is you can use a towel, just place a towel around your leg,
},
{
    250.66,254.98
     place the right ankle on top and all you do now is using the towel to
},
{
    254.98,259.78
     create a little bit of pull, see, for your piriformis muscle. So you hold the
},
{
    259.78,264.02
     pull here and again you hold it for about 10 seconds, 5 to 10 repetitions,
},
{
    264.02,265.88
     I repeat this 3-4 times
},
{
    265.88,269.72
     a day. So that's a good stretch again for your piriformis laying on your back. Now the
},
{
    269.72,274.52
     most intense thing you can do for a piriformis muscle is a self massage technique and all
},
{
    274.52,278.68
     you need for that is a ball. Now I'm going to demonstrate two self massage techniques
},
{
    278.68,287.04
     to you for the piriformis. The first one is lay the ball here. Now place your right foot underneath your left leg,
},
{
    287.04,291.04
     like this, and placing the ball on my performance muscle,
},
{
    291.04,292.2
     pushing myself up a little bit,
},
{
    292.2,294.0
     and all I do now is a self massage
},
{
    294.0,297.36
     where I rotate my buttocks, my muscle,
},
{
    297.36,299.8
     over the ball and do a self massage.
},
{
    299.8,303.04
     So this is uncomfortable and effective.
},
{
    303.04,307.4
     If you really wanna get a good self massage technique technique, even a more intense one, what you
},
{
    307.4,313.0
     do is you now place your left ankle on top of your right, sorry, your right ankle on top
},
{
    313.0,315.16
     of your left knee, push yourself up.
},
{
    315.16,318.68
     Now you find a spot and again you do this self massage.
},
{
    318.68,322.72
     Again you do this for 10, 15 seconds, three to four repetitions on this one.
},
{
    322.72,323.72
     Don't do it too intense.
},
{
    323.72,325.4
     You can do this multiple times a day.
},
{
    325.4,328.76
     And that will really help to alleviate the tension
},
{
    328.76,330.08
     you feel in your piriformis
},
{
    330.08,331.84
     and getting rid of this piriformis syndrome
},
{
    331.84,333.12
     and the symptoms you have in your back,
},
{
    333.12,335.68
     your hip and your leg.
},
{
    335.68,338.16
     I hope you've enjoyed this video on the piriformis stretch
},
{
    338.16,339.84
     and I hope it helps you to relieve your pain
},
{
    339.84,342.56
     in your back, your buttocks, the back of your leg
},
{
    342.56,344.74
     and possibly your hip as well.
