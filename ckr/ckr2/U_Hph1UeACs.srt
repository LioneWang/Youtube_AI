     Hi, I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist and I'm Brad Heineck physical therapist
},
{
    5.12,8.6
     Together we are the most famous physical therapists on the internet and our opinion of course Bob
},
{
    8.6,12.32
     Today we're going to talk about top three ways to treat muscle spasms or cramps
},
{
    12.84,17.16
     Basically we're talking about that charty horse quite often that you get in your calf muscle maybe at night
},
{
    17.48,19.48
     Now generally these things are harmless
},
{
    19.52,22.84
     Right, I don't want you to panic when you get one, but they are painful
},
{
    22.84,25.94
     But they can be very painful and if they're very
},
{
    32.72,33.08
     Persistent and very painful then you should see your doctor, quite often some of the common causes, probably one of the most common causes is medications
},
{
    38.0,39.84
     Side effect, blood pressure medications, oral contraceptives
},
{
    47.16,48.46
     Cholesterol lowering medications, those are also the kind and diuretics, okay another one, things that make you go pee Yep
},
{
    48.46,55.04
     They're drawing the water out of your system, the other thing is if you're low on potassium or magnesium that would also
},
{
    55.76,59.72
     Maybe play a role, so make sure you get vegetables, bananas, that kind of stuff
},
{
    59.72,64.26
     So you're looking at those things, but we're gonna give you top three ways first to help prevent it
},
{
    64.26,68.56
     And then we're gonna talk about three things you can do if it does occur anyway
},
{
    68.84,73.92
     So the first thing you want to make sure to try to prevent it is another really common cause is dehydration
},
{
    73.92,80.52
     And so you want to make sure you're keeping hydrated during the day drinking some regular water on a regular water
},
{
    80.52,85.54
     Right drinking water on a regular basis, so you haven't seen football players that get cramped up
},
{
    85.54,92.44
     Whether they get dehydrated or they're working over exertion can do it too, so the second thing you want to do is
},
{
    94.84,100.64
     Right before you go to bed you're gonna do a couple of exercises that I want to see you do and one of them is
},
{
    101.56,104.06
     Okay, Lonnie, do you want to move that chair out of the way Brad?
},
{
    111.22,115.86
     One of them is, one is real simple to do, it's just gonna do some ankle pumps like this bread It's just gonna get a little movement in the calf and it's gonna get loosened up before you go to bed
},
{
    115.86,122.44
     And this quite often helps prevent those Charlie horses from coming out. How many about 20? Yeah, you can do 20 just for a minute
},
{
    122.44,125.72
     Right, and probably emphasize on the pulling up motion
},
{
    125.96,129.72
     Exactly and then what you want to do is go ahead and do a stretch to it
},
{
    130.12,134.8
     You're gonna just take a towel like this and you're gonna get the towel around the forefoot
},
{
    134.8,142.28
     You got this Lonnie and you're gonna pull toward you give a gentle stretch toward you. Oh, oh my those feet Bob
},
{
    143.04,147.22
     I know don't get too close. Alright the other thing you can do
},
{
    147.22,151.24
     by the way we have just done a video on this on how to make your do-it-yourself
},
{
    151.24,155.48
     incline board. Right, this is Brad and Mr. Handyman was showing how to do this.
},
{
    155.48,159.72
     Sure. And Brad do you want to show how to use your thing here? You bet. You can buy
},
{
    159.72,164.36
     these anywhere online and you can go to some sporting goods stores and they'll likely have them.
},
{
    164.36,165.36
     An ankle stretch incline board, is that what you'd look up maybe sporting goods stores and they'll likely have them. An ankle stretch, incline board
},
{
    165.36,170.24
     Is that what you'd look up maybe? Yeah, incline board or ankle stretch either one will probably pull it up
},
{
    170.24,175.6
     I like that something to hold on so you can really relax and this is pretty aggressive
},
{
    175.6,180.08
     You know if you're an older person or not real active this might be too aggressive for you
},
{
    182.28,186.96
     Yeah, you can start back here and then it's not so bad and then to further you bring your foot up
},
{
    187.8,189.8
     The more aggressive. You can even bend your knee too.
},
{
    190.24,194.96
     Little bend in the knee gets a different muscle gets that soleus muscle. It's a nice one thing
},
{
    194.96,201.24
     I think to have near the bed. Yep, and you can do that stretch. So all right despite all the third thing you can do
},
{
    201.4,206.48
     By the way is actually you want to untuck the covers on the edge of the bed
},
{
    206.72,208.72
     Because if those covers
},
{
    208.88,211.68
     Those covers are holding the foot down like this
},
{
    211.68,215.92
     These are some big heavy covers in the winter time kind of the weight is forcing the
},
{
    215.92,217.92
     Ah right now actually
},
{
    217.92,219.92
     It does make you want to almost cramp up
},
{
    220.08,224.72
     So you want to take all the stress off that area so you want to make sure the end of the covers are on top
},
{
    224.72,231.22
     Get some light fluffy covers or puts big winter socks on and then you can pull the covers above your feet
},
{
    233.58,237.7
     All right, let's say despite those preventative measures you still get a cramp
},
{
    237.7,239.78
     So the first thing you want to do when you get a cramp
},
{
    239.78,241.78
     And some of you who probably know this already
},
{
    242.3,244.62
     Is you're gonna get off the edge of the bed
},
{
    244.62,248.82
     You're gonna try to put some weight on the foot itself to try to get that cramp and calm down
},
{
    249.18,250.86
     Essentially stretching the muscle
},
{
    250.86,257.2
     Yeah, and if you can try to put some weight on the foot and if you really can go ahead and bend the foot like this
},
{
    257.36,260.08
     Got all this running? Stretch that muscle out
},
{
    260.8,266.88
     Now let's say that's just too aggressive for you that's just just too much Well then just try to pull the toe toward your head
},
{
    267.48,272.2
     Yep, just gently try to pull it toward you and see if that helps calm it down
},
{
    272.2,279.76
     If that's all too much even you can just manually try to massage the muscle or you can even just jiggle a muscle
},
{
    279.76,282.2
     You know just trying to get it moving like this
},
{
    283.04,288.98
     Now after you got things calmed down and then things are still kind of hurting you can go ahead and put cold or heat on it
},
{
    288.98,292.16
     You have an ice pack or a heating pad if you've had one by the bed
},
{
    292.48,296.76
     Whatever you respond better to yeah, but just please don't fall asleep with a heating pad on
},
{
    296.76,298.76
     People can get burned by those
},
{
    298.84,303.04
     You can do a hot shower or a warm bath anything like that to help calm it down
},
{
    303.04,305.16
     So those are some of the
},
{
    305.16,310.88
     non maybe more conservative ways of trying to treat this issue instead of
},
{
    310.88,315.04
     getting aggressive. I can tell you from my experience if I've gotten them in
},
{
    315.04,319.12
     bed and immediately I just start pulling my toes up like this while I'm in
},
{
    319.12,323.88
     under the covers, I pull up and usually I can get ahead of it or if
},
{
    323.88,326.16
     I'm swimming and I get a cramp in my muscles
},
{
    326.16,331.9
     Which swimmers doing if if you're experienced swimmer you can do I don't even talk about swimming with cramps
},
{
    331.9,335.74
     But I just do that motion for that for that and it works out well
},
{
    335.74,338.72
     I have those I just live with them Bob
