     How do you know if someone is having a stroke?
},
{
    4.24,8.32
     What are some of the common symptoms and signs that you might want to look out for?
},
{
    8.32,12.48
     Well, there's something called the fast test that might help you to remember the most
},
{
    12.48,15.8
     common symptoms and signs of a stroke.
},
{
    15.8,17.4
     So fast, what does this mean?
},
{
    17.4,19.28
     Well, for starters, it's a mnemonic.
},
{
    19.28,24.0
     So we'll sort of delve into each of these letters in a minute, but it's also a bit of
},
{
    24.0,31.12
     a reference to the need to diagnose strokes really quickly so that they can in turn be treated quickly.
},
{
    31.12,35.92
     Because remember the longer that treatment is delayed, the longer the person is losing
},
{
    35.92,38.56
     neurons if they're actually having a stroke.
},
{
    38.56,40.04
     And let me put it to you this way.
},
{
    40.04,45.42
     For every minute that blood flow isn't restored to the brain, the person will lose about 2
},
{
    45.42,46.74
     million neurons.
},
{
    46.74,49.26
     Wow, that is a lot of neurons.
},
{
    49.26,52.22
     So fast, not just a mnemonic.
},
{
    52.22,53.94
     And let's actually just jump right in here.
},
{
    53.94,57.5
     So again, you want a quick, easy way to tell if someone's having a stroke.
},
{
    57.5,62.38
     So you can start by having a look for these common signs and symptoms.
},
{
    62.38,65.16
     So we'll start with the F. The F means face.
},
{
    65.16,69.6
     Often a person having a stroke won't be able to control their facial muscles as normal,
},
{
    69.6,73.08
     and they might actually develop drooping of their mouth on one side.
},
{
    73.08,76.96
     So you can look at their face and check for any asymmetry.
},
{
    76.96,80.46
     And actually a good way to bring this out is to ask the person to smile.
},
{
    80.46,86.56
     So they'll try to smile, hopefully, and it might make it easier to look for any drooping on one side.
},
{
    86.56,88.64
     The A stands for arms.
},
{
    88.64,95.2
     So for example, since strokes can cause weakness in your limbs, either on one side or on both sides of your body,
},
{
    95.24,100.36
     it's a nice easy little test to check if the person can raise both their arms.
},
{
    100.36,107.58
     So if there's some difficulty or inability in raising one or both of their arms then that might suggest a stroke has occurred
},
{
    108.36,111.2
     now the s the s stands for speech and
},
{
    111.52,117.2
     Strokes can actually affect areas in the brain responsible for producing speech and understanding speech as well
},
{
    117.2,122.58
     So the person may have slurred speech or they may not really be able to understand what you're saying to them
},
{
    122.58,126.72
     So try to get the person talking to see if there are any speech problems.
},
{
    126.72,128.0
     S for speech.
},
{
    129.0,130.44
     And T is for time.
},
{
    130.44,135.36
     So we kind of alluded to this earlier because in situations of suspected strokes,
},
{
    135.36,139.4
     which are actually medical emergencies, time is really critical.
},
{
    139.4,143.08
     So if you see any of these signs above, the ones that we sort of just talked about,
},
{
    143.08,147.52
     the person would need to be taken to a hospital right away.
},
{
    147.52,151.68
     So just to clarify, what I just mentioned, actually the first three bits of the mnemonic
},
{
    151.68,155.56
     in particular, these aren't the only symptoms of stroke.
},
{
    155.56,159.3
     They're just some of the more common ones that let you do a pretty quick check to see
},
{
    159.3,161.88
     if someone might be having a stroke.
},
{
    161.88,164.32
     And two last things before we finish up here.
},
{
    164.32,165.28
     So the first
},
{
    165.28,169.3
     thing, you can get more than one of these symptoms happening at one time, and you
},
{
    169.3,173.26
     often actually develop these in combinations. So for example, you might
},
{
    173.26,177.34
     get the facial weakness and difficulty speaking and trouble moving your limbs
},
{
    177.34,181.66
     all at once, or you might get two of them, or you might get all of them plus
},
{
    181.66,188.5
     other symptoms. These are just some of the more common symptoms and they can happen in combination or not.
},
{
    188.5,190.2
     And the second thing is, well,
},
{
    190.2,192.7
     we want to know how long these symptoms last, right?
},
{
    192.7,194.7
     And it kind of depends on what's happening
},
{
    194.7,196.7
     with the cerebral blood supply, right?
},
{
    196.7,198.7
     Because remember, stroke is an interruption
},
{
    198.7,200.1
     in your cerebral blood supply,
},
{
    200.1,202.0
     the blood supply to your brain
},
{
    202.0,204.4
     that is severe enough that it actually causes damage
},
{
    204.4,208.08
     to your brain, right? And the other thing is remember that TIAs and
},
{
    208.08,212.84
     strokes can have the same initial symptoms. So by knowing how long the
},
{
    212.84,216.76
     symptoms have lasted that'll sort of help to tease out whether it's a TIA or a
},
{
    216.76,221.68
     stroke that's going on. And so to further clarify if without treatment these
},
{
    221.68,225.0
     symptoms go away within about 24 hours,
},
{
    225.0,229.0
     then that generally means that the blood flow to that blocked off area of brain
},
{
    229.0,231.0
     has been restored within 24 hours,
},
{
    231.0,236.0
     which by definition means that a TIA, a transient ischemic attack, has happened,
},
{
    236.0,240.0
     and ergo, that's what caused the transient symptoms.
},
{
    240.0,245.6
     So the symptoms will eventually go away when the blood flow is restored within 24 hours, if it's a TIA.
},
{
    246.32,252.96
     On the other hand, if the blood flow isn't restored within 24 hours, then by definition a stroke has occurred.
},
{
    253.36,259.92
     And then the symptoms would last longer than 24 hours and they may start to resolve after treatment.
},
{
    260.72,269.12
     So there's a quick way to assess if someone might be having a stroke, the the fast assessment. And just as a reminder, if you do notice these symptoms,
},
{
    269.12,274.12
     then the person needs to be taken to a hospital right away.
},
