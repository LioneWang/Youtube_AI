     I'm Billy Joe with Medical Service Company.
},
{
    10.44,12.36
     I'm a respiratory therapist.
},
{
    12.36,14.94
     I'm here today to show you an oxygen tank.
},
{
    14.94,16.18
     This is your backup tank.
},
{
    16.18,19.44
     You would get this whenever you get set up on oxygen.
},
{
    19.44,22.84
     You can see on the tank here you've got this little white
},
{
    22.84,25.36
     label or kind of a cover. This shows you that the tank here you've got this little white label or kind of a cover. This
},
{
    25.36,30.56
     shows you that the tank is full. You could have a white one, a blue one, a gray
},
{
    30.56,36.44
     one. You want to take it off to actually use your tank. You can slide it right up
},
{
    36.44,41.36
     over. If you can't get it off you could always peel it off. And then underneath
},
{
    41.36,47.0
     the white cover you'll see on the tank you've got three holes on one side.
},
{
    47.0,60.0
     And then if you turn the tank, you've got one hole on the other side.
},
{
    60.0,62.0
     Right here you've got a gauge.
},
{
    62.0,69.1
     This gauge you've got three prongs inside that stick out and one on the other side.
},
{
    69.1,72.26
     Then on the other side of the gauge you've got a dial.
},
{
    72.26,75.98
     This dial will tell you how much oxygen is in your tank.
},
{
    75.98,79.26
     So you have to line this up with your tank.
},
{
    79.26,83.3
     You have to slide this on.
},
{
    83.3,87.52
     Just slide it right over the top. You line up your three pegs and you twist
},
{
    87.52,96.52
     this. And you keep twisting until it's locked tight. You just have to hand tighten it.
},
{
    96.52,108.0
     There's no need to tighten it with a wrench or anything. Then you can see on here the gauge. So you want to take this key.
},
{
    108.0,113.88
     You've got these little holes there. They line up right on the top of the tank.
},
{
    113.88,120.18
     Put them on there. Turn it about
},
{
    120.18,123.52
     halfway. You can see the little needle popped up to the top.
},
{
    123.52,126.0
     You'll never see the needle go further down.
},
{
    126.0,128.0
     It'll always be at about 2,000.
},
{
    128.0,131.0
     This tank is now considered open and on.
},
{
    131.0,135.0
     To turn it, you turn this little end,
},
{
    135.0,137.0
     and the oxygen will come on.
},
{
    137.0,140.0
     You want to turn this number to the number that your
},
{
    140.0,142.0
     doctor's told you to use.
},
{
    142.0,146.88
     So it should match your machine.
},
{
    147.88,150.12
     Then on the bottom here, you're gonna connect your tubing,
},
{
    150.12,151.82
     which should be in this little bag.
},
{
    156.32,158.2
     You're just gonna take this end,
},
{
    159.44,161.96
     and it's gonna connect right to the tank.
},
{
    164.32,165.68
     And then your cannula. Should go right in the tank. And then your cannula.
},
{
    167.96,171.68
     Should go right in your nose, you've got the prongs.
},
{
    171.68,174.46
     They go right in your nose over your ears.
},
{
    177.36,178.56
     And then you're connected.
},
{
    181.44,183.08
     I hope this was helpful.
},
{
    183.08,184.84

    193.0,198.0
