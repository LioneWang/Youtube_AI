{
    51.0,51.92
     Are we gonna show them, Bob?
},
{
    51.92,52.88
     It's all, yeah, right here,
},
{
    52.88,54.84
     this is the Renfold foot massager
},
{
    54.84,58.0
     and this is like perfect timing, Brad.
},
{
    58.0,58.84
     Imagine that.
},
{
    58.84,59.68
     Right.
},
{
    59.68,61.08
     Because we're talking about chronic foot pain.
},
{
    61.08,62.2
     This baby in itself,
},
{
    62.2,63.72
     you probably don't even have to watch the video,
},
{
    63.72,68.72
     this would probably take care of it. Most of the people that we have tried this absolutely love it.
},
{
    68.72,74.64
     I mean, you put your foot right in there without your shoes on, of course, it massages, it
},
{
    74.64,79.84
     puts some gentle compression on there to get the swelling out. It's a nice unit.
},
{
    79.84,83.44
     Yeah, it's got three settings to it. It's got heat, which doesn't really work that well,
},
{
    83.44,85.28
     to be honest with you. I don't think it works.
},
{
    85.28,86.12
     I mean, it doesn't.
},
{
    86.12,86.96
     They just don't feel that much heat.
},
{
    86.96,90.0
     But the massage alone is well worth it.
},
{
    90.0,92.96
     So all right, so what are the six exercises, Brad?
},
{
    92.96,93.8
     You're asking me.
},
{
    93.8,95.04
     I know, I'm gonna tell you.
},
{
    95.04,98.88
     So the first one that I think almost everybody should do,
},
{
    98.88,101.32
     and this is especially if you have chronic foot pain.
},
{
    101.32,103.48
     So I'm gonna slip my shoe off here.
},
{
    103.48,106.24
     What you wanna do, a lot of people are having trouble with the band on the bottom of their foot pain. So I'm gonna slip my shoe off here. What you wanna do, a lot of people are having trouble
},
{
    106.24,108.56
     with the band on the bottom of their foot,
},
{
    108.56,109.88
     basically the fascia.
},
{
    109.88,111.68
     Right, so the plantar fascia?
},
{
    111.68,115.44
     The plantar fascia, that's where plantar fasciitis comes from.
},
{
    115.44,117.6
     But even if you don't have that,
},
{
    117.6,120.0
     a lot of times this band is tight.
},
{
    120.0,121.88
     So what I want you to do is you're gonna go ahead
},
{
    121.88,122.72
     and you're gonna grab,
},
{
    122.72,125.48
     the band goes all the way up into the toes.
},
{
    125.48,127.92
     Would it be better with my shoe up, my sock off?
},
{
    129.84,130.68
     Sure?
},
{
    130.68,131.84
     Well, maybe for the video, but not for me.
},
{
    131.84,133.64
     Yeah, not for you.
},
{
    133.64,135.12
     But so you see the band,
},
{
    135.12,137.48
     you might even be able to catch a little bit of it there.
},
{
    137.48,139.96
     So now that band goes right up into the toes.
},
{
    139.96,143.28
     So I want you to grab the toes and pull.
},
{
    143.28,145.72
     So you're gonna pull the ankle this way
},
{
    145.72,147.2
     and the toes this way,
},
{
    147.2,149.0
     and just give it a good stretch,
},
{
    149.0,150.62
     good like 30 second stretch,
},
{
    150.62,153.6
     or you can do pressure on, pressure off.
},
{
    153.6,154.44
     Sure.
},
{
    154.44,156.52
     Pressure on, pressure off.
},
{
    156.52,158.24
     Do this throughout the day.
},
{
    158.24,159.12
     And this is gonna help,
},
{
    159.12,160.48
     especially if you apply it to fasciitis,
},
{
    160.48,164.08
     but even just put a pain on the bottom of the foot.
},
{
    164.08,165.58
     All right, the second one I want you to do
},
{
    165.58,167.28
     is actually stretch your heel cord.
},
{
    167.28,168.12
     Oh, sure.
},
{
    168.12,168.94
     You wanna do that one, Brad?
},
{
    168.94,170.76
     So the heel cord is from the heel,
},
{
    170.76,172.44
     as the muscle goes up the calf muscle
},
{
    172.44,173.7
     all the way up to the knee.
},
{
    173.7,175.78
     There's two primary muscles there.
},
{
    177.22,179.6
     And we got a couple of devices that really work well.
},
{
    179.6,181.64
     The gastrocnemius and the soleus, by the way,
},
{
    181.64,182.48
     the two muscles.
},
{
    182.48,183.32
     Yep.
},
{
    183.32,185.2
     So with this particular one.
},
{
    186.8,187.9
     Now we're gonna show you how to do it
},
{
    187.9,190.56
     without a device too, but I really like this
},
{
    190.56,192.56
     as I use this every morning.
},
{
    192.56,194.24
     This one's got a nice cam action on it,
},
{
    194.24,196.56
     so it gives you a lot of mechanical leverage.
},
{
    196.56,199.92
     Plus it's got a toe wedge which extends the toe,
},
{
    199.92,201.8
     which does the same thing Bob was talking about.
},
{
    201.8,202.64
     That's why I like it.
},
{
    202.64,205.92
     It's a great stretch before running or walking.
},
{
    205.92,207.56
     So, and then.
},
{
    207.56,209.08
     It's just easy to rock on it.
},
{
    209.08,211.76
     Yeah, and you can do the same pressure on,
},
{
    211.76,215.06
     pressure off 10 times or hold it up to 30 seconds.
},
{
    215.96,220.36
     If you want, you can just get an incline board like this.
},
{
    220.36,222.48
     This one I made, we have a video on how to make one
},
{
    222.48,224.4
     if you got someone handier on the house.
},
{
    224.4,226.24
     They're relatively simple if you got a saw
},
{
    226.24,228.88
     and some plywood, or you can buy these two.
},
{
    228.88,232.24
     And this works really well.
},
{
    232.24,234.8
     I like this, I use this one at home,
},
{
    234.8,236.28
     just because I have one.
},
{
    236.28,237.12
     And the-
},
{
    237.12,239.28
     By the way, this is called the Pro Stretch Plus.
},
{
    239.28,240.12
     Oh, thank you.
},
{
    240.12,241.84
     The Pro Stretch Plus, that's the plus
},
{
    241.84,243.32
     is the extra tow thing.
},
{
    243.32,245.36
     Do you wanna show Brad how you can just do it,
},
{
    245.36,246.56
     you can do it without anything here?
},
{
    246.56,249.76
     Sure, can you zoom over this way, Liz?
},
{
    250.8,252.32
     He's gonna show it against the wall.
},
{
    252.32,257.32
     Yeah, so, and this works, not as well as the devices
},
{
    257.44,259.88
     we show, but pretty good, it works fine.
},
{
    259.88,261.56
     It works better with the shoe on.
},
{
    261.56,263.36
     Make sure your toe is not pointed this way,
},
{
    263.36,264.96
     it should be straight towards the wall.
},
{
    264.96,267.56
     Put the heel down and lean into the wall.
},
{
    267.56,270.64
     So again, it's important to stretch this whole complex here.
},
{
    270.64,271.48
     Sure.
},
{
    271.48,272.8
     This kind of, you know what, I know they call it
},
{
    272.8,274.96
     like the posterior chain when they talk up
},
{
    274.96,277.32
     by the hip and stuff, but it's the same down here.
},
{
    277.32,279.16
     This is all connected here.
},
{
    279.16,281.16
     And so the more stress you can take off
},
{
    281.16,283.68
     that the less stress you're putting on the foot.
},
{
    283.68,286.76
     Next one, next two are gonna be strengthening ones.
},
{
    286.76,289.68
     So the first one is just real simple.
},
{
    289.68,293.36
     I want you to, you're gonna strengthen both the,
},
{
    293.36,295.88
     the gastrocnemius and the soleus also,
},
{
    295.88,297.72
     our gastrocnemius and the soleus,
},
{
    297.72,299.64
     but you're also gonna strengthen the bottom of the foot,
},
{
    299.64,301.36
     a little bit of the intrinsic.
},
{
    301.36,304.96
     So basically I'm just gonna have you raise up on your toes
},
{
    304.96,307.04
     and raise up on your heels.
},
{
    307.04,309.84
     Now you can do it next to a countertop or a chair
},
{
    309.84,311.68
     and you can do these throughout the day.
},
{
    311.68,315.42
     It's really great to do these just as a strengthening one.
},
{
    315.42,317.32
     So you don't take a lot of time out of your day
},
{
    317.32,320.76
     just when you're even come on and talk to your spouse
},
{
    320.76,321.96
     or your loved ones.
},
{
    321.96,324.24
     It happens to be a great one for balance as well.
},
{
    324.24,326.4
     If your balance is off or you're elderly
},
{
    326.4,328.92
     and we do use this one, not just for pain,
},
{
    328.92,331.44
     but balance and strengthening it all fits together.
},
{
    331.44,332.8
     Yeah, easy one to do throughout the day.
},
{
    332.8,334.6
     Next one Brad's gonna show the zigzags.
},
{
    334.6,335.44
     Oh yeah.
},
{
    335.44,337.0
     This is gonna get the muscles
},
{
    337.0,339.56
     that are more lateral and medial.
},
{
    339.56,342.6
     So inside, outside, it's gonna catch all those.
},
{
    342.6,345.24
     Yep, so when your ankle goes this way,
},
{
    345.24,347.12
     that's normally the way you sprain it,
},
{
    347.12,349.24
     but this actually strengthens the muscles.
},
{
    349.24,350.96
     So this you need to have your shoes on,
},
{
    350.96,353.6
     set them a little grippy on a floor like this,
},
{
    353.6,355.8
     so it offers some resistance.
},
{
    355.8,358.36
     And you go back and forth like this,
},
{
    358.36,361.76
     and you go about five or 10 feet one direction,
},
{
    361.76,363.42
     and then you go the other way.
},
{
    364.64,366.54
     And again, we're not just strengthening
},
{
    366.54,367.54
     the ankles and the feet.
},
{
    367.54,369.84
     Actually, you're working some of the hip muscles as well.
},
{
    369.84,372.7
     If that's too easy, simply go on one foot.
},
{
    372.7,374.48
     And if you have a cane or something,
},
{
    374.48,377.82
     or a stick to hold, that works good for balance.
},
{
    377.82,378.66
     You may not need it.
},
{
    378.66,380.26
     It looked like quite the dancer there, Brad.
},
{
    380.26,381.1
     Oh yeah.
},
{
    381.1,383.16
     Well, Fred, there was, you know.
},
{
    383.16,384.0
     You taught him, huh?
},
{
    384.0,385.52
     Yeah, exactly right. Yeah, this was one I taught him, huh? He's exactly right.
},
{
    385.52,387.48
     Yeah, this was one of his techniques
},
{
    387.48,391.0
     that he doesn't show many, he didn't show much.
},
{
    391.0,394.24
     All right, so we showed two exercises for stretching.
},
{
    394.24,396.82
     We showed two exercises for strengthening.
},
{
    396.82,400.08
     Now we're gonna show two massages that you can do.
},
{
    400.08,400.92
     Very simple.
},
{
    400.92,402.08
     If you don't have the machine, that is.
},
{
    402.08,402.92
     Right.
},
{
    402.92,405.52
     So the first one is just you're gonna do a circle massage.
},
{
    405.52,407.36
     It's easy just to take your thumbs.
},
{
    407.36,409.64
     I'm in a little bit of a bad position here
},
{
    409.64,411.24
     because I'm trying to do it on the side,
},
{
    411.24,412.96
     but boy, my foot is sensitive.
},
{
    412.96,415.68
     I mean, I can, so I'm just taking my thumbs
},
{
    415.68,417.42
     and I'm making circles.
},
{
    417.42,419.64
     And you can work the whole foot this way.
},
{
    419.64,421.68
     It's a lot easier if I go like this, you know,
},
{
    421.68,423.6
     but I'm trying to demonstrate at the same time.
},
{
    423.6,424.44
     So.
},
{
    424.44,425.76
     You can't get your wife to do this for you?
},
{
    425.76,427.8
     Oh no, that's not gonna happen.
},
{
    427.8,429.38
     She's not getting anywhere near my feet.
},
{
    429.38,430.22
     She just won't.
},
{
    430.22,431.22
     I don't blame her.
},
{
    431.22,432.06
     Her hands are.
},
{
    432.06,432.9
     You're a smart woman.
},
{
    432.9,434.4
     She wants to keep her hands apparently.
},
{
    434.4,437.56
     So, alright, so that's the circle massage.
},
{
    437.56,438.4
     You can work through it.
},
{
    438.4,441.16
     And then you do what we call a displaying massage.
},
{
    441.16,442.78
     So you put your thumbs together
},
{
    442.78,446.96
     and you pull them apart like this, thumbs together, pull them apart.
},
{
    446.96,449.64
     I'm putting pressure on, what my feet are sensitive?
},
{
    449.64,451.76
     Well, Bob, I don't know what to tell you about that.
},
{
    451.76,452.6
     Yeah, geez.
},
{
    452.6,453.44
     Yeah.
},
{
    453.44,454.28
     I should be doing this more often.
},
{
    454.28,455.52
     You're gonna have to wash your hands.
},
{
    455.52,456.36
     Yeah, I know.
},
{
    456.36,458.96
     But here we're seriously, we're working at stretching
},
{
    458.96,462.52
     the tissues plus increasing circulation.
},
{
    462.52,464.68
     And that's all good.
},
{
    464.68,466.04
     You can even go up into the heel.
},
{
    466.04,466.88
     Sure.
},
{
    466.88,468.88
     But this is by far the most sensitive spot.
},
{
    468.88,471.88
     Typically the planter fascia is here.
},
{
    471.88,474.68
     Right, this is usually where the planter fascia is.
},
{
    474.68,476.32
     Does the pain present itself?
},
{
    476.32,477.16
     Yeah.
},
{
    477.16,478.08
     So you're gonna show an alternative?
},
{
    478.08,479.36
     Well, yeah, actually, you know,
},
{
    479.36,482.48
     you can take a tennis ball or here's a lacrosse ball
},
{
    482.48,484.8
     and that could be good for a massage
},
{
    484.8,486.44
     and you can just work it.
},
{
    486.44,489.34
     I'm gonna work that and you work it wherever it feels good.
},
{
    489.34,491.16
     If you hit a spot that's really tender,
},
{
    491.16,493.94
     you can work at it, but only continue if it starts
},
{
    493.94,496.14
     to feel better over the next 20 or 30 seconds.
},
{
    496.14,497.52
     You don't wanna irritate it,
},
{
    497.52,499.92
     but you do wanna, sometimes a sore spot
},
{
    499.92,501.72
     will work its way out after about that long
},
{
    501.72,502.76
     and then you know you're good.
},
{
    502.76,505.08
     And sometimes where you're kind of alluding to the fact
},
{
    505.08,506.72
     you should work around the sore spots.
},
{
    506.72,508.0
     There you go, yeah.
},
{
    508.0,510.6
     Now this literally is at the grocery store
},
{
    510.6,512.2
     right before you check out.
},
{
    512.2,513.9
     So that is the neatest thing.
},
{
    513.9,515.76
     And it's actually got nice-
},
{
    515.76,516.6
     Little spikes.
},
{
    516.6,519.04
     Little spiky things on there, but it's soft
},
{
    519.04,522.5
     and actually lights up, which is a nice thing.
},
{
    523.34,527.62
     But that really changes compared to the lacrosse ball
},
{
    527.62,529.02
     or the tennis ball.
},
{
    529.02,532.0
     The little knobbies on there helps it.
},
{
    532.0,532.84
     And so-
},
{
    532.84,533.76
     So it's not too much?
},
{
    533.76,535.3
     Yeah, that's caused me $2.
},
{
    535.3,537.9
     No, but I mean, it's not too much as far as the spikes.
},
{
    537.9,538.96
     No, it's not too aggressive.
},
{
    538.96,539.8
     This one is not.
},
{
    539.8,541.14
     It's soft and it's a little squishy.
},
{
    541.14,542.42
     It just adds a little bit.
},
{
    542.42,545.04
     And sometimes that can be helpful with the painful.
},
{
    545.04,546.96
     Oh yeah, be careful with it though.
},
{
    546.96,548.16
     There goes my light.
},
{
    549.04,550.0
     Oh, you're right.
},
{
    550.0,551.52
     It is, yeah.
},
{
    551.52,553.36
     I thought some of the simplest things
},
{
    553.36,555.64
     could be so nice to use.
},
{
    555.64,556.84
     So there we go.
},
{
    556.84,558.8
     Remember Brad and I can fix just about anything.
},
{
    558.8,560.76
     Except for a broken heart.
},
{
    560.76,561.76
     But we're working on it.
},
{
    561.76,564.0
     We try to work on it anyway when we got spare time.
},
{
    564.0,570.0
     I don't know if this is gonna help, but it's still nice on the feet. Yeah. All right, thanks.
},
