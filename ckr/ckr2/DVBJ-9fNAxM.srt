     What we're going to do now is look at improvised tourniquets.
},
{
    7.72,12.24
     Now you'd only consider using an improvised tourniquet, as excellent as commercial one,
},
{
    12.24,15.18
     is direct pressure has not worked.
},
{
    15.18,19.64
     Now it may well be that you're out and about, you don't have a commercial tourniquet available,
},
{
    19.64,23.2
     so you need to use whatever's to hand.
},
{
    23.2,25.16
     What we're doing here is using a triangular bandage
},
{
    25.16,29.56
     but you could use any strong pliable material like gauze material, triangular
},
{
    29.56,33.76
     bandages, clothing. We want to have something that's tight but also that's
},
{
    33.76,36.64
     not going to be too tight to cause problems so try and make sure it's at
},
{
    36.64,41.68
     least five centimeters thick. Don't use things like wire or string or rope or
},
{
    41.68,47.76
     shoelaces as this will cause damage and will just cut into the muscle on the arm.
},
{
    47.76,50.96
     Also things like leather belts can be a problem which you won't physically be able to tighten
},
{
    50.96,53.12
     them up enough.
},
{
    53.12,58.6
     Never put an improvised tourniquet over the actual wound site or over a joint but they
},
{
    58.6,62.8
     can be placed over clothing if necessary but they are best if they can go directly onto
},
{
    62.8,63.8
     the skin.
},
{
    63.8,67.68
     So we're now going to look at how to actually apply a tourniquet. So all I've done is
},
{
    67.68,72.12
     I've pre-folded up a triangular bandage so it's around about 5cm
},
{
    72.12,76.4
     minimum thickness. What we're doing is placing this on the upper arm so
},
{
    76.4,80.1
     simulating there's a cut just about here on the arm. So placing on the upper arm
},
{
    80.1,83.68
     we don't want to put too near the joint so you want to make sure that it's in on
},
{
    83.68,90.08
     the mid shaft of this bone so that we can put it on and stop all arterial blood flow.
},
{
    90.08,94.04
     To start with all we're doing is taking the dressing, tying it in a half knot over the
},
{
    94.04,100.92
     top, just pull that so it's tight and then we need to be able to tighten it up.
},
{
    100.92,109.08
     So we can use anything to hand, I've used a knife here but it could be anything, a strong lump of timber or metal or anything that you've got to hand.
},
{
    109.08,112.6
     But just be careful about using things like a pen because as you tighten this
},
{
    112.6,116.32
     up it's likely the pen will break and it won't be efficient. Once you've laid
},
{
    116.32,124.0
     something over it then take the bandage and just tie that in place and then using
},
{
    124.0,128.32
     the knife just wind it around. So what we're doing is we're
},
{
    128.32,135.12
     just winding it around and applying more and more pressure. As this is going on it
},
{
    135.12,138.68
     will be uncomfortable for the person so you do need to be telling them that you
},
{
    138.68,141.96
     know this is going to basically save their life because we need to stop this
},
{
    141.96,145.0
     bleeding. If you apply this on until it's
},
{
    145.0,148.76
     just tight then the problem there is you're going to stop the venous bleed
},
{
    148.76,153.44
     that venous return and not the arterial. So the blood is going to go this way but
},
{
    153.44,158.08
     nothing's coming back you need to stop all blood flow. So keep going tight and
},
{
    158.08,161.56
     if it is still oozing blood out then you need to all spurt in blood you just need
},
{
    161.56,168.28
     to put more pressure on. But once this starts going on it will slow the blood flow down and it will hopefully
},
{
    168.28,172.2
     start to resolve the problem. Once you've got it into the right position just use
},
{
    172.2,178.2
     in the tails, tuck that round and then you can go underneath and tie it in place.
},
{
    178.2,183.84
     So once it's tied securely in place the tourniquet can be left in place. There's
},
{
    183.84,190.06
     no problem with it coming off. If you do see blood flow you can apply more pressure, but one thing you don't do
},
{
    190.06,195.36
     is take this off, you leave this in place until they get to the emergency medical rooms.
},
{
    195.36,199.44
     Other thing with it is don't cover it over, we must make sure that all emergency services
},
{
    199.44,203.36
     know that the tourniquet has been applied. If you cover them over with a coat or something
},
{
    203.36,209.68
     like that it may be in some cases it gets missed. So when the paramedics arrive make sure you tell them you put a tourniquet
},
{
    209.68,214.88
     on. Also you get a pen you can just write a T on their forehead and the time you applied the tourniquet.
},
{
    214.88,219.68
     That's important so that the doctors in the hospital know how long this was in place for.
},
{
    219.68,224.72
     They can help with their treatment of the casualty. So improvise tourniquets in a very,
},
{
    224.72,225.28
     very effective
},
{
    225.28,229.76
     way of stopping bleeding if you don't have a commercial tornacal available.
},
