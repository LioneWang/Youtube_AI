     Hi, this is Dr. Lou Jacobs at Jacobs Chiropractic Acupuncture Center in Portland, Maine, and I am
},
{
    4.88,10.96
     here to help you get rid of the sinus pressure and sinus pain that you're having that's keeping
},
{
    10.96,20.64
     you up all night without the use of any medications. All you need is these. Here's how it works. I'm
},
{
    20.64,25.12
     not going to get into the details. I want this to be quick. There are six points on your face
},
{
    25.12,27.04
     that will relieve pressure in your sinuses,
},
{
    27.04,30.08
     and they can be found just like this.
},
{
    30.08,35.04
     The first are right here at the inner margin of your eyebrow.
},
{
    35.04,38.8
     You apply pressure there for 10 to 30 seconds
},
{
    38.8,40.64
     until you start to feel your forehead
},
{
    40.64,42.84
     and the pressure clear out a little bit
},
{
    42.84,48.92
     and then you move on to the next points. The next points are down here where the crease of your cheek meets
},
{
    48.92,54.72
     your nose right there. Apply pressure for 10 to 30 seconds until you start to
},
{
    54.72,59.0
     feel things clear out hopefully and then you move on to the next point. The last
},
{
    59.0,64.28
     points are down here at the lower crease down here right up underneath your
},
{
    64.28,65.08
     cheekbones.
},
{
    65.08,68.24
     Apply a little bit of pressure there, mild to moderate,
},
{
    68.24,71.24
     for anywhere from 10 to 30 seconds,
},
{
    71.24,74.64
     or until you feel your sinuses start to clear out,
},
{
    74.64,75.88
     and then you release.
},
{
    75.88,77.8
     And you can repeat this as much as you'd like.
},
{
    77.8,81.32
     If you do it too much, you might feel a little bit sore.
},
{
    81.32,83.96
     These points are used in traditional Chinese medicine,

{
    87.0,91.0
     relieve pressure in your sinuses. They work really, really well.

     If you have a sinus infection, go to your medical doctor and get some antibiotics.
