     My friend here, something is you can do to keep your bones healthy and strong.
},
{
    2.72,5.36
     Our bones have the potential to be very powerful with the right training.
},
{
    5.36,8.16
     But if we neglect them, this can lead to injury, especially as we get older.
},
{
    8.16,8.96
     So let's train.
},
{
    8.96,11.04
     Exercise in general strengthens your bones.
},
{
    11.04,13.84
     And just like your muscles, your bones can adapt to increasing force.
},
{
    13.84,15.76
     The stronger the force is, the stronger the bones.
},
{
    15.76,17.2
     I didn't make the law, I just follow it.
},
{
    17.2,20.08
     You can use weights to increase the amount of force put through your bones.
},
{
    20.08,22.24
     Look for a full body press and a full body lift.
},
{
    22.24,24.48
     We can put even more force through our body with isometrics,
},
{
    24.48,26.32
     because you can always hold more weight than you can lift.
},
{
    26.32,28.08
     This is just a bar, chain, and spring.
},
{
    28.08,29.52
     I have other videos on how to make one.
},
{
    29.52,31.36
     You can also push and pull on a small tree.
},
{
    31.36,32.88
     Push with one arm and pull with the other.
},
{
    32.88,34.32
     And then switch and do the same thing.
},
{
    34.32,36.88
     If you don't have equipment, you can try explosive calisthenics.
},
{
    36.88,40.24
     Although your body weight doesn't change, the increased speed amplifies the force.
},
{
    40.24,41.92
     You don't need anything too complex.
},
{
    41.92,43.52
     Simple movements are enough to start.
},
{
    43.52,46.16
     All of this only applies if you build up progressively.
},
{
    46.16,48.6
     If you break all your bones, you're getting weaker, not stronger.
},
{
    48.6,51.96
     Among other things, make sure you're getting plenty of calcium and phosphates in your diet.
},
{
    51.96,53.16
     And don't forget the sun.
},
{
    54.28,56.92
     And we heal and we grow when we rest, so please rest.
},
{
    56.92,59.08
     I hope that can help you and you have a beautiful day.
