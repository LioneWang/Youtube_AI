     At least once in your life, you probably will experience some sort of low back pain and
},
{
    4.96,9.78
     that can be caused by gradual deconditioning of the lower back due to our modern sedentary
},
{
    9.78,13.72
     lifestyles such as sitting at a desk for long periods of time or bending and lifting
},
{
    13.72,18.72
     in a wrong manner that can cause unnecessary stress and strain in the lower back.
},
{
    18.72,23.48
     From hours to years of not stimulating or exercising the core muscles, the lower back
},
{
    23.48,25.76
     muscles or mobilizing the lower back to protect the lower back muscles, or mobilizing the lower
},
{
    25.76,30.16
     back to protect the lower back. And if we decide to do something out of the ordinary, for example,
},
{
    30.16,34.72
     jumping on the trampoline or doing a sport we don't usually do, help someone move house,
},
{
    34.72,39.76
     or renovate a house, we're at risk of injury, not just your lower back, but other areas of the back
},
{
    39.76,46.12
     as well. So I recommend doing some sort of core exercise, lower back exercise, or
},
{
    46.12,49.78
     mobilize the lower back at least a few times a week to prevent lower back
},
{
    49.78,54.92
     injury, lower back pain, and improve your lifestyle and improve your health of
},
{
    54.92,60.1
     your spine. In this video I'll be showing you the lower back exercises, the core
},
{
    60.1,66.68
     exercises, and some mobilization exercises for your lower back inspired by Stuart McGill.
},
{
    66.68,69.92
     If you're getting out of the pain phase for your lower back, I highly recommend you do
},
{
    69.92,75.6
     these exercises to help you reduce the pain, prevent the pain and prevent injury.
},
{
    75.6,80.12
     I do these exercises myself to help my Olympic weightlifting because it helps my balance
},
{
    80.12,85.72
     and it helps me keep that rigidity when I do that lifting and movement. I do
},
{
    85.72,89.76
     prescribe these exercises to my patients as well and they've definitely been
},
{
    89.76,94.46
     improving and their lower back pain is subsided. I hope these exercises help you
},
{
    94.46,100.2
     as much as they helped me and my patients. Unilateral core exercises. Lay on the floor
},
{
    100.2,105.88
     your back will naturally create an arch off the floor. Rotate your pelvis back
},
{
    105.88,111.36
     into posterior pelvic tilt and your back will flatten. If you can slide your hands
},
{
    111.36,117.16
     under your lower back, that means your lower back is not flat and the core is not activated.
},
{
    117.16,122.68
     Now with your back flat against the floor, one leg is straight and lifted off the floor,
},
{
    122.68,130.6
     and the other is bent with the foot on the floor for stability, raise your shoulders and head slightly off the floor.
},
{
    130.6,132.98
     This counts as one repetition.
},
{
    132.98,139.38
     Do this for 10-20 repetitions, having one minute rest and repeat it for 4 sets.
},
{
    139.38,145.56
     Remember to swap sides with one leg bent and the other leg straight each time. If you find these
},
{
    145.56,151.22
     exercises uncomfortable, you can try to do modified isometric versions of this exercise
},
{
    151.22,157.0
     by holding the position instead. However, it is crucial that the form is in a perfect
},
{
    157.0,166.0
     position, such as keeping the pelvis rotated posteriorly, back flat and the core is activated. Hold this position for 10 to 20 seconds and
},
{
    166.0,171.88
     do them for 4 to 6 sets. Make sure you alternate both sides with the
},
{
    171.88,177.84
     bent leg. If you need have one minute break in between each set. By having one
},
{
    177.84,182.92
     leg on the floor and one leg straight you are creating a torsion in the lower
},
{
    182.92,189.84
     back. To improve the exercise and keep you in better form, you can place your fingers on your abdomen.
},
{
    189.84,195.8
     Slightly to the side, from your belly button to make sure your abdomen is constantly activated.
},
{
    195.8,200.88
     By having one leg up and the other leg down whilst doing this exercise, it will work on
},
{
    200.88,205.16
     the stabilizing muscles of the core, whilst you are moving and causing
},
{
    205.16,211.4
     uneven forces trying to twist and shift the core and the lower back from the rigid position.
},
{
    211.4,216.8
     Therefore, this exercise is excellent for sport, preventing lower back pain and improving
},
{
    216.8,221.04
     rigidity in the lower spine, preventing potential injuries.
},
{
    221.04,226.36
     Please try not to protrude your neck out like you're trying to touch the ceiling with your chin.
},
{
    226.36,232.12
     What you want to do is to have your chin slightly tucked in and raise your back of your head off
},
{
    232.12,238.08
     the floor and not lead with the chin up. If you lead with your chin up however this will be
},
{
    238.08,245.64
     over activating and tensing your upper trapezius muscle that can cause tightness and pain in the neck and possibly
},
{
    245.64,247.34
     headaches.
},
{
    247.34,251.48
     Side Planks Start off by laying on your side with both
},
{
    251.48,254.56
     knees bent and your feet behind you.
},
{
    254.56,259.18
     Prop yourself up on your elbow so that your forearm is flat on the ground.
},
{
    259.18,264.72
     Now push your arm into the floor through your shoulder and squeezing your fist at the same
},
{
    264.72,265.28
     time to activate and recruit all the muscles through your shoulder and squeezing your fist at the same time to
},
{
    265.28,269.68
     activate and recruit all the muscles in your shoulder. Whilst trying to stay
},
{
    269.68,275.16
     balanced, have your assisting hand on the side of your hip and then raise your hip
},
{
    275.16,280.6
     off the ground in a controlled manner. Squeeze your glutes so that your hips
},
{
    280.6,288.32
     are straight with your body making your body like a plank. Do 10 to 20 repetitions
},
{
    288.32,296.96
     and repeat the exercise three times on each side. You can have a minute rest between each set if
},
{
    296.96,302.96
     you need to. If you find this exercise too easy you can do this exercise with your legs straight
},
{
    306.32,308.78
     easy, you can do this exercise with your legs straight, and place the foot that is on top in front of you for balance.
},
{
    308.78,314.3
     This will reduce the leverage you have over the exercise and make the exercise a lot harder
},
{
    314.3,315.8
     to do.
},
{
    315.8,321.08
     Remember to keep your hips in line with your body to replicate a side plank during the
},
{
    321.08,322.32
     exercise.
},
{
    322.32,325.52
     If you find these exercises too hard, you can hold a
},
{
    325.52,332.32
     side plank instead, which is an isometric exercise. However, it is crucial during a
},
{
    332.32,338.6
     side plank hold to focus on activating the core muscles whilst breathing. The
},
{
    338.6,344.4
     same rules apply here when you are doing the exercise with repetitions. Make sure
},
{
    344.4,345.14
     you press
},
{
    345.14,349.7
     through your shoulder and make a fist to ensure there is muscle tension and
},
{
    349.7,356.5
     muscle recruitment in the shoulder and upper back. Hold the plank for 10 seconds
},
{
    356.5,363.7
     and repeat the exercise on both sides for three sets each side. If you need a
},
{
    363.7,366.72
     rest take a break for one minute between each set.
},
{
    366.72,374.22
     Try to start out with your knees first and then when it's too easy go into a full plank with
},
{
    374.22,381.8
     your legs out. This exercise works on the quadratus lumborum and the oblique muscles of your abdominal
},
{
    381.8,386.88
     wall. These muscles are in charge of helping you twist, turn and
},
{
    386.88,393.16
     bending side to side. In this case, by holding this position, you are resisting your body
},
{
    393.16,398.68
     from collapsing against gravity. I really liked prescribing this exercise because I
},
{
    398.68,405.44
     noticed most of the exercises that we tend to do or prescribe are very front and back dominated, such as
},
{
    405.44,407.44
     bending forward and back.
},
{
    407.44,412.84
     However, within clinic practice, I notice most of my patients I see tend to have poor
},
{
    412.84,419.52
     side strength and twisting, causing them to sustain an injury during these movements.
},
{
    419.52,425.64
     During the dynamic movement of the side plank raises, the spine will flex left to right. This will
},
{
    425.64,429.92
     open and close the vertebrae allowing nutrients to flow in and out of the
},
{
    429.92,435.56
     discs. This will help reduce stiffness, inflammation and repair if there is an
},
{
    435.56,440.76
     injury. That's why the side plank raises are very effective to improve spinal
},
{
    440.76,449.72
     health and reduce pain and stiffness in the lower back. Try them out. Cat cows go on all fours with your hands and knees spaced out or slightly
},
{
    449.72,455.92
     wider than your shoulder width and your knees are about 90 degrees. Then around
},
{
    455.92,461.92
     your back and flex all segments in your spine all the way up and posteriorly
},
{
    461.92,466.24
     rotate your hips back tucking your hips backwards, squeezing
},
{
    466.24,472.32
     the abdominal muscles and chest muscles to make yourself look like an angry cat.
},
{
    472.32,475.36
     This will cause the spine to flex.
},
{
    475.36,481.92
     To do a cow position, anteriorly rotate your hips, drop your stomach towards the floor
},
{
    481.92,485.84
     and squeeze your shoulder blades together, this will extend
},
{
    485.84,489.44
     your upper back and lower back slightly.
},
{
    489.44,498.0
     Take in a deep long breath during a cow position and exhale in a long and slow manner in the
},
{
    498.0,499.92
     cat position.
},
{
    499.92,508.64
     Do 10 repetitions for 3 to 4 sets and if you really need to have one minute break
},
{
    508.64,515.48
     between the sets. This exercise will help you when you have extreme or acute
},
{
    515.48,522.28
     lower back pain as it helps mobilize the spine and back in a safe manner. The
},
{
    522.28,526.24
     vertebral discs in the spine get a chance to have mobilization
},
{
    526.24,532.88
     and drawing fluid into the disc back again to reduce stiffness and inflammation. If you spend
},
{
    532.88,539.2
     a lot of time standing or sitting during the day, I highly recommend this exercise to help with pain,
},
{
    539.2,546.34
     stiffness and maintain a healthy posture for the spine. A research paper was published in 2018
},
{
    546.34,548.84
     on the McGill Stabilization Exercises
},
{
    548.84,551.98
     and Conventional Physical Therapy Exercises
},
{
    551.98,555.42
     on how they affect pain, functional disability,
},
{
    555.42,558.6
     and range of motion in chronic low back pain.
},
{
    558.6,561.58
     The results showed that both physical therapy
},
{
    561.58,564.08
     and the McGill Stabilization Exercises
},
{
    564.08,566.0
     provided a similar outcome. However, the McGill stabilization exercises provided a similar outcome.
},
{
    566.0,571.92
     However, the McGill exercises gave a better result in patients for functional disability
},
{
    571.92,572.92
     and pain.
},
{
    572.92,578.84
     So just a friendly reminder, the stabilization exercises in this video are the McGill stabilization
},
{
    578.84,580.72
     exercises.
},
{
    580.72,588.52
     And the modified exercises where there is a lot of dynamic movement are similar to conventional physical therapy exercises.
},
{
    588.52,593.1
     Both exercises seem to help with low back pain and functionality
},
{
    593.1,596.94
     but the McGill exercises do seem to have a better result
},
{
    596.94,599.66
     for functional disability and pain.
},
{
    599.66,603.7
     So whether you have low back pain or want to prevent low back pain or injury
},
{
    603.7,607.5
     I highly recommend these exercises in this video.
},
{
    607.5,612.16
     Bird Dogs This is another exercise named after an animal.
},
{
    612.16,618.2
     Go on all fours and with your knees and hands slightly spread out, shoulder width apart.
},
{
    618.2,622.76
     Find your neutral spine and try to brace it and lock it in position.
},
{
    622.76,625.92
     Once you feel like you can hold yourself in this position,
},
{
    625.92,631.6
     bring your legs straight out behind you but not too high as it may twist your spine and cause
},
{
    631.6,638.16
     unnecessary rotation in your lower back. Then bring your opposite arm straight out in front of you
},
{
    638.16,645.76
     with your elbows locked with your thumb up. This will help activate the lower trapezius muscle that tends to be neglected
},
{
    645.76,651.68
     during the day through daily habits. Once you feel the lower trapezius muscle activate,
},
{
    651.68,657.28
     you can tuck your thumb back in and clench your fist and keep your arms straight out with your
},
{
    657.28,662.16
     elbows locked. This will activate the muscles in the shoulders and the back much better.
},
{
    662.72,670.68
     Now in a slow and controlled manner, bring the knee of the extended leg that is out back in so it touches your fist and
},
{
    670.68,675.96
     then bring it back out again whilst you hold your core in place in a neutral
},
{
    675.96,683.48
     spine. Do 10 repetitions on both sides for 2 to 3 sets on both sides with 1
},
{
    683.48,687.12
     minute rest. If you find this exercise too hard, you can
},
{
    687.12,693.68
     do the isometric hold version of this exercise instead. Where you just bring your leg out
},
{
    693.68,699.14
     and your arm out and hold in the core and lower back in a neutral position. Hold this
},
{
    699.14,707.28
     position for 10 seconds on both sides for 3 sets on each side. Rest 1 minute if you need to.
},
{
    707.28,711.76
     People that mainly benefit from these exercises are people that rely on strong control of
},
{
    711.76,717.3
     the core and lower back during movements of flexion where the spine is under pressure
},
{
    717.3,722.56
     such as powerlifters, Olympic weightlifters or people that have gone through spinal surgery
},
{
    722.56,726.32
     or injuries. I do them myself and prescribe
},
{
    726.32,731.64
     these exercises for my patients and I find that the ones that do learn and attain the
},
{
    731.64,737.64
     strength of a time seem to have less or no back pain at all in the long run. If you prefer
},
{
    737.64,742.56
     to do the isometric holds but would like to challenge yourself a little bit further, you
},
{
    742.56,746.0
     can by drawing small squares with either
},
{
    746.0,752.32
     your fist or foot. This will create movement in the spine that the core will need to resist
},
{
    752.32,757.52
     and work against to build core stability and control. This will be replicating external
},
{
    757.52,762.56
     forces acting on you whilst you are bending over or trying to lift yourself or performing
},
{
    762.56,768.76
     a lift in the gym. So the strength that you attain through these exercises are quite functional from daily
},
{
    768.76,772.0
     activities and sport.
},
{
    772.0,778.08
     Depending on how fast you draw the squares, you can try to draw 3 to 5 squares on both
},
{
    778.08,784.44
     sides and do 3 sets on both sides with 1 minute break if you need to.
},
{
    784.44,786.0
     Remember, you don't have to draw
},
{
    786.0,791.28
     the squares clockwise, you can also draw the squares anti-clockwise. Obviously work on your
},
{
    791.28,796.8
     weaknesses so you can prevent the injury and lower back pain. So this is an exercise summary
},
{
    796.8,801.68
     I've written for the video. Just pick two to three exercises you're comfortable with and do it for
},
{
    801.68,805.04
     about three to five weeks. Once you're ready, just increase the
},
{
    805.04,812.0
     intensity by doing more repetitions to a maximum of 20 or hold the exercise for a bit longer to a
},
{
    812.0,817.68
     maximum of 20 seconds and then repeat the program again. Feel free to pause the video and print
