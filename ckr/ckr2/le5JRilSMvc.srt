{
    0.0,10.0
     No, no, no, I can't believe it not again that stupid Raph.
},
{
    10.0,11.0
     What is wrong with him?
},
{
    11.0,14.0
     Oh, I'm going to lose so much money on this game.
},
{
    14.0,17.0
     Oh, this is just unbelievable.
},
{
    17.0,19.0
     I can't believe it.
},
{
    19.0,21.0
     Hey, Joe, what's going on, man?
},
{
    21.0,23.0
     Oh, I watched this game and this Raph.
},
{
    23.0,24.0
     He doesn't know what he's doing.
},
{
    24.0,25.56
     Oh, this is horrible.
},
{
    25.56,28.52
     Well, the game is one thing, but you don't look like you're
},
{
    28.52,29.32
     doing so well.
},
{
    29.32,30.44
     What's going on?
},
{
    30.44,31.44
     Oh, I don't know.
},
{
    31.44,33.0
     I think I'm just stressed out.
},
{
    33.0,35.88
     I've got a lot of pain right up here in my chest.
},
{
    35.88,38.24
     It's almost like someone's sitting on my chest.
},
{
    38.24,40.12
     Well, I tell you what.
},
{
    40.12,42.6
     That's pretty classic signs and symptoms, along with you
},
{
    42.6,45.28
     sweating so bad of a possible heart attack.
},
{
    45.28,47.76
     Have you ever had a history of a heart attack or heart problems before?
},
{
    47.76,50.32
     No, I've never had any problems like that before.
},
{
    50.32,54.88
     Well, I'll tell you what, to be on the safe side, why don't we just call an ambulance and have them check you out?
},
{
    54.88,55.36
     No.
},
{
    55.36,57.2
     Just to make sure that it's not a heart attack.
},
{
    57.2,58.56
     No, I don't need an ambulance.
},
{
    58.56,61.36
     If I got to go to the hospital, I'm just going to drive if I have to.
},
{
    61.36,63.04
     Well, listen, listen, here's the deal.
},
{
    63.76,67.32
     If it is possibly a heart attack,
},
{
    67.32,69.92
     it is gonna be so important for you to be seen
},
{
    69.92,72.68
     and get whatever it is that's causing it removed
},
{
    72.68,75.08
     so that you don't have more serious problems.
},
{
    75.08,77.46
     And you would never wanna drive yourself to the hospital
},
{
    77.46,79.76
     because if you go unconscious while you're driving
},
{
    79.76,82.96
     that vehicle, you not only run the risk of hurting yourself
},
{
    82.96,89.84
     or killing yourself, but could you imagine running into another car that's filled with children and family members and wiping
},
{
    89.84,90.84
     them out?
},
{
    90.84,91.84
     I mean, that's just too much.
},
{
    91.84,93.4
     No, I understand.
},
{
    93.4,98.08
     So I tell you what, why don't we just call 911, let's get them on the way.
},
{
    98.08,100.6
     If it's nothing, they'll be able to let us know that.
},
{
    100.6,104.8
     But if it is something serious, then we're going to be able to get you in for treatment.
},
{
    104.8,108.64
     Let's give them a call, All right. Yeah, 9-1-1. Listen, you know what?
},
{
    108.64,113.32
     There's a lot of research that shows that heart attack patients, if they can
},
{
    113.32,117.4
     take aspirin, has your doctor ever said anything about not taking aspirin or that
},
{
    117.4,123.4
     you cannot take aspirin? Any allergies to medications that you know of?
},
{
    123.4,125.2
     No. Any bleeding
},
{
    125.2,128.92
     problems that would stop you from being able to take aspirin? No, nothing like that. Okay,
},
{
    128.92,132.88
     well here's a couple baby aspirin you can take between two and four of those. Just pop them
},
{
    132.88,139.28
     in, chew it up and swallow it and that's going to help reduce the risk of further blood clot
},
{
    139.28,144.96
     formation. It's not guaranteed but it has been shown to be very helpful. So just swallow that down
},
{
    143.96,148.4
     It's not guaranteed, but it has been shown to be very helpful. So just swallow that down and just get into a nice position of comfort.
},
{
    148.4,153.32
     If anything's tight or constricting, feel free to loosen that up and just kind of try
},
{
    153.32,154.32
     to relax.
},
{
    154.32,155.32
     Okay, buddy.
},
{
    155.32,158.14
     So let's take a closer look at heart attacks.
},
{
    158.14,160.92
     First of all, what are they and why do they happen?
},
{
    160.92,166.08
     Secondly, is there anything we can control or are we out of control when it comes to heart
},
{
    166.08,171.6
     attacks? Thirdly, let's review the signs and symptoms so that we know that they may be having a heart
},
{
    171.6,177.12
     attack and that it's important to call 911 or activate emergency medical services. Well, first
},
{
    177.12,185.0
     of all, what's a heart attack? Well, a heart attack is anything that actually occludes a vessel that feeds the heart.
},
{
    185.0,188.7
     And when that heart muscle begins to starve of oxygen,
},
{
    188.7,194.2
     it causes pain. And that pain is usually what they feel when they say,
},
{
    194.2,197.0
     yeah, it felt like an elephant was sitting on my chest or
},
{
    197.0,202.2
     it's the squeezing feeling and sometimes it may even radiate to one or both arms.
},
{
    202.2,205.32
     It can also potentially radiate up into the neck.
},
{
    205.32,208.56
     And in some cases, they've even said it feels like jaw pain
},
{
    208.56,210.0
     or a toothache.
},
{
    210.0,212.6
     In women, it's very characteristic for it
},
{
    212.6,214.32
     to actually go to the back,
},
{
    214.32,217.0
     and it makes them feel like they might have pulled a muscle
},
{
    217.0,219.16
     or have muscle strain.
},
{
    219.16,221.28
     And in many cases, they might put it off
},
{
    221.28,224.56
     because it's not that classic drenched in sweat,
},
{
    224.56,228.88
     diaphoresis, diaphoresis being the technical term for heavy sweating.
},
{
    228.88,232.88
     They might just feel like they're achy or that they've got indigestion.
},
{
    232.88,236.18
     And so they can sometimes put it off for too long
},
{
    236.18,239.08
     and then suffer other consequences as a result.
},
{
    239.08,242.38
     But in the case where it's classic signs and symptoms,
},
{
    242.38,250.8
     the heavy sweating, this crushing chest pain, radiating to one or both arms, up into the neck or jaw, shortness of breath,
},
{
    250.8,256.32
     difficulty breathing, weakness, nausea, these are all classic signs and symptoms of a heart
},
{
    256.32,257.32
     attack.
},
{
    257.32,261.68
     Yeah, that isn't to say that other things can sometimes mimic that.
},
{
    261.68,265.16
     They could be that they have angina that comes and goes and so it
},
{
    265.16,268.88
     feels like that for a little bit but then it goes away. It's still kind of
},
{
    268.88,272.2
     like thunder on the horizon and they should take note of that and maybe
},
{
    272.2,276.56
     rule out the chance that it is an active heart attack but it can also be
},
{
    276.56,281.64
     things like pneumonia or pleuritis or even a broken rib. But in the end it's
},
{
    281.64,284.76
     better to rule out the heart attack and make sure it's not something that's
},
{
    284.76,285.5
     life-threatening. So if in doubt call 911 and make sure that it's better to rule out the heart attack and make sure it's not something that's life-threatening.
},
{
    285.5,289.5
     So if in doubt, call 911 and make sure that it's not a heart attack.
},
{
    289.5,294.5
     So what are some of the risk factors? What do we eat? How much do we exercise?
},
{
    294.5,298.5
     Are we smoking cigarettes or other things that are bad for us?
},
{
    298.5,304.5
     If we have diabetes and we can control it, are we controlling it or is it out of control?
},
{
    304.5,305.52
     Those would be classified as the controllable risk factors. diabetes and we can control it, are we controlling it? Or is it out of control?
},
{
    309.0,309.96
     Those would be classified as the controllable risk factors.
},
{
    315.52,315.96
     Uncontrollable is more things like genetic predisposition. Like I have this incredibly high
},
{
    319.72,320.16
     cholesterol level and I'm a vegetarian. Well, that can happen.
},
{
    326.0,330.5
     Things like diabetes that just won't stay in control no matter how much we treat it. Things like race. Things like being male.
},
{
    330.5,337.5
     These are all the things that we have by research found to predispose certain people to cardiovascular disease.
},
{
    337.5,340.0
     And there's not much they can do to change that.
},
{
    340.0,345.28
     Not to say that there isn't other things they can do to help prevent heart disease.
},
{
    347.28,348.2
     Now let's talk about the signs and symptoms.
},
{
    355.08,355.68
     When they have those signs and symptoms like profuse sweating, chest pain, arm pain, neck pain, jaw pain,
},
{
    359.12,359.56
     dizziness, shortness of breath, nausea, weakness,
},
{
    364.24,367.72
     these are all classic signs and symptoms that the person might be having a heart attack. And if they display those signs and symptoms,
},
{
    367.72,369.36
     our job is pretty clear.
},
{
    369.36,372.12
     Call 911 immediately.
},
{
    372.12,373.92
     Get the ambulance on the way.
},
{
    373.92,376.6
     If it's not a heart attack, it's okay.
},
{
    376.6,378.68
     We can always disregard the ambulance
},
{
    378.68,380.68
     or they can rule that out then.
},
{
    380.68,384.2
     But if it is a heart attack, time is of the essence.
},
{
    384.2,386.7
     And we don't wanna slow any of that treatment down.
},
{
    386.7,389.18
     Their life could depend on it.
},
{
    389.18,392.42
     Remember that most people will want to deny that it's really a heart attack.
},
{
    392.42,396.18
     They'll also probably want to drive themselves into the hospital.
},
{
    396.18,401.14
     Both are extremely dangerous, not only for themselves, but for anybody who becomes a
},
{
    401.14,408.36
     victim of a person who's unconscious behind a wheel, careening into that vehicle and hurting other people.
},
{
    408.36,413.96
     So remember, if you're waiting for the ambulance and they can take aspirin,
},
{
    413.96,417.7
     it's one of the first treatments that even the paramedics would do.
},
{
    417.7,421.0
     Because aspirin, when it's absorbed into the bloodstream,
},
{
    421.0,424.24
     works like a platelet lubricant.
},
{
    424.24,426.24
     It actually helps blood platelets slide
},
{
    426.24,432.0
     by each other so that they don't stick and make a bigger clot. So it's actually
},
{
    432.0,436.24
     one thing that you can do if the patient allows you to give it to them where
},
{
    436.24,441.0
     they can take aspirin and help themselves prevent a worse heart attack or
},
{
    441.0,448.28
     actually relieve some of the symptoms. If they have say nitroglycerin tabs or a spray
},
{
    448.28,450.44
     and they can't get up to get it,
},
{
    450.44,452.4
     you can assist them by going to get it
},
{
    452.4,453.4
     and giving it to them.
},
{
    454.4,457.68
     Remember to keep the patient as calm as possible.
},
{
    457.68,459.84
     You can't lie to them and tell them everything's
},
{
    459.84,462.32
     gonna be okay because we don't know if that's true.
},
{
    462.32,464.56
     But we could reassure them that they're gonna be
},
{
    464.56,467.52
     in good hands and that you're not going to leave them alone.
},
{
    467.52,472.12
     If they have tight garments we can loosen those up and then allow the patient to
},
{
    472.12,479.08
     be in the best position of comfort they can find while we wait for EMS to arrive.
},
