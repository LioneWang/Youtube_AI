},
{
    8.88,14.12
     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist, Brad Heineck physical therapist, we are the most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    14.12,16.12
     In our opinion of course Bob
},
{
    16.4,20.24
     We're at top five self treatments. We were changing the numbers for a while
},
{
    20.24,25.04
     So we're going with this top five self treatments for tailbone pain which is your
},
{
    25.04,32.32
     coccyx and they also call it coxidinia because dinia means pain so pain in your tailbone. Is that
},
{
    32.32,38.08
     Latin? That's a good question I don't know. I think it is anyways maybe someone can comment on that.
},
{
    38.08,41.76
     Maybe one of the persons just wandered in can comment on it. I see more than one Bob I see

     Not being able to be liked

     Yeah, I look like me
},
{
    62.0,62.48
     Be liked
},
{
    68.6,72.24
     Yeah, I like me if I look like that. I'm glad by the way as a disclosure nobody's sat on that yet So well, I know it's okay for you to do that. You just pulled it out of the box
},
{
    73.4,79.28
     Alright so this we get a lot of questions on this Brad. I mean this is an injury that I think is fairly common
},
{
    79.8,85.4
     Let's first talk about where the injury occurs. So you've got your low back here
},
{
    85.64,91.32
     Brad's gonna use this as a backdrop so that the black it'll show up better
},
{
    92.0,96.12
     So this is your low back. I'm facing the person facing that way. Yep
},
{
    96.6,99.08
     And right below it is the sacrum
},
{
    99.8,105.12
     And then right below that is the little coccyx this this little bone right here, it's all fused together
},
{
    105.32,109.08
     It's got one little joint there now normally when you sit down
},
{
    109.68,113.12
     The coccyx does move forward like this just a little bit
},
{
    113.72,116.96
     And kind of it actually acts a little bit as a shock absorber
},
{
    117.12,121.64
     The other point I want to make is that it's not just hanging out in the air like this
},
{
    121.64,125.26
     It has muscles and ligaments and tendons
},
{
    125.26,129.16
     I mean it actually gets filled in here with muscles and that's gonna become
},
{
    129.16,133.82
     important later, this is well supported, yeah it's well supported, when you
},
{
    133.82,138.76
     get an injury let's say you fall onto your butt, one of the things that can
},
{
    138.76,143.42
     happen is it can actually get fractured or it can get pushed forward like
},
{
    143.42,149.02
     this, like that probably not that far but just for visual purposes
},
{
    149.02,153.08
     I want you to see it like or it can actually go this way Brad go out
},
{
    153.08,156.4
     Yeah, that can happen in childbirth during labor
},
{
    156.92,162.6
     Yeah, I can see that it can also go off to the side. I heard one guy say one
},
{
    163.6,165.22
     Practitioner say it always goes off to the left. He doesn't know why but it tends to always goes off to the left
},
{
    165.22,169.7
     He doesn't know why but it tends to be more off to the left. It can also rotate
},
{
    170.62,173.88
     And this is something obviously you can see in x-rays, right?
},
{
    173.88,176.86
     It's a bone or it could do a combination of any one of those
},
{
    176.86,181.62
     Sure, but all that and a lot of times these tend to get better on their own
},
{
    181.62,184.12
     You know it may take a couple of weeks or a month
},
{
    184.1,189.9
     tend to get better on their own, it may take a couple of weeks or a month but if they don't it may be the muscles around them that are are acting up and
},
{
    189.9,194.72
     spasming on you. And I don't know what you found but I know from real patients
},
{
    194.72,200.64
     as well as my wife had this, it was more than a month, it was a number of months.
},
{
    200.64,204.84
     Oh was it? Yeah it can be slow healers, I think it depends on how you treat it.
},
{
    204.84,208.68
     Well it was a number of months because she didn't do the top five things that we're gonna mess with.
},
{
    208.68,214.88
     Well she didn't ask me. I got in trouble. I think we can okay so what are some of the common injuries?
},
{
    214.88,220.52
     Obviously the fall onto your bottom would do it. Sure. Well we already talked about during labor it
},
{
    220.52,227.96
     can happen. I suppose maybe a baby with a big head. Yeah, right. This is common in I think in snowboarders
},
{
    227.96,233.24
     Oh, yeah, because they fall backwards and with their feet into the boards right on their butt
},
{
    233.24,241.56
     And it's typically ice and I know they have pads special pads in their gear to help prevent that because also people who ride horses
},
{
    241.56,246.26
     Brad. Oh, I can see that bouncy bouncy bouncy
},
{
    246.26,253.4
     Unless common causes would be an actual fracture when you when you fall but
},
{
    253.4,256.78
     also there can be, I mean this is why you want to get checked out by a doctor
},
{
    256.78,261.64
     sometimes if there was no event if you just start having pain there you can
},
{
    261.64,265.96
     have a malignancy or a tumor there and it could also be an infection
},
{
    265.96,268.88
     So and sometimes they just show up
},
{
    268.88,272.76
     Sure, things happen unexplained with human bodies
},
{
    273.12,276.72
     So we got kind of our now these are the self treatments you can do
},
{
    276.72,279.92
     There's other things you can try if your self treatments don't work
},
{
    279.92,283.48
     And we'll talk about this when we're done, but let's start off with number one
},
{
    283.52,287.4
     The first thing you do Brad is just you want it to try to get it to calm down
},
{
    288.24,294.04
     So to get it to calm down you're gonna try some ice just for a short period of time Brad's got the ice pack here
},
{
    294.04,300.82
     Yep, you're gonna sit on that Brad? Sure. That'll wake me up Bob. You remember the old happy days show?
},
{
    301.32,303.32
     Oh, of course
},
{
    304.0,307.36
     But wouldn't they always say sit on it? Wasn't that the joke?
},
{
    307.36,315.56
     Sit on it. Let's get on with the show. Alright next thing, so you're gonna, I'd also take maybe a
},
{
    315.56,321.88
     natural anti-inflammatory or like ibuprofen and just maybe hit it pretty hard for three days
},
{
    321.88,330.04
     and see if that calms it down. Alright after that or during that period of time you do want to make sure you're not putting pressure on that area
},
{
    330.04,335.8
     And generally people find that it hurts when they're sitting on it and it hurts more
},
{
    336.08,342.32
     Actually Brad when you lean back, if you lean forward a little bit it often takes the pressure off the area
},
{
    342.52,350.48
     So we're going to show you two sitting solutions one is obviously just to buy a donut and like Brad said it's clean yet
},
{
    350.48,355.82
     Nobody's sat on it yet. This one is nice because it has the circle and if you look at it this way
},
{
    355.82,360.92
     There's actually a groove here and here which is going to allow some space for the coccyx to be relieved
},
{
    361.08,363.64
     Yeah, I'll put the link below
},
{
    364.36,369.7
     They also provided us with some other, it's called ergonomic innovations is the company and
},
{
    371.54,377.78
     It's a really well made nice device. Thanks for sending us to it. Yeah, it's got a good density to it
},
{
    377.78,382.28
     It's not like some of the real soft and you go squish right in so yeah, well built
},
{
    382.5,385.52
     So the second thing I need a pillow Brad you might need a pillow
},
{
    386.52,388.52
     Brad loves this he loves to throw a pillow at me
},
{
    390.4,393.28
     So if you don't have one of those in here in a pinch right now
},
{
    393.28,397.26
     You just fold the pillow in half like this and then you're gonna sit on it
},
{
    397.26,404.42
     And you're gonna sit to the point where your coccyx is off the pillow. Let's do a profile with that
},
{
    404.8,406.8
     Hope you can see it on here
},
{
    407.08,408.68
     Get that in there
},
{
    408.68,412.44
     So now you can see Mike, there's no pressure on the coccyx
},
{
    412.44,419.1
     Right so this air you're right back in here is open which you know takes the pressure off it which is good
},
{
    419.1,424.2
     I had a person that commented one time that it saved him on a plane
},
{
    424.2,427.84
     Oh really? He went to made the flight
},
{
    427.84,432.0
     Oh sure, I can't believe it. You really want to avoid putting pressure on that area
},
{
    432.0,433.76
     All you're doing is firing up the muscles there
},
{
    433.76,440.04
     So step number three then is we're gonna try some heat now you can try a regular heating pad
},
{
    440.72,444.88
     But what we think would work even better is the thermotex
},
{
    449.14,450.94
     Infrared, far infrared because Because it goes deeper. Right much deeper
},
{
    458.04,459.48
     Normal heating paths just go a couple millimeters. Sure. This goes up to 60 millimeters, which is two point, remember Brad?
},
{
    468.52,469.08
     2.36 inches. Yeah, 2.36. Whatever, over two inches is pretty pretty good So that that can get into those muscles on that pelvic floor
},
{
    472.68,477.36
     One thing I would say is if you fell on it, it's very sore I would not use heat until after a few days, right and that's why we talk about the ice first, right
},
{
    477.6,479.32
     Very good point Brad
},
{
    479.32,482.64
     This the way the thermotex works and we'll put a link below
},
{
    482.8,487.04
     It's got a hard pad and that's the side that you actually would sit on
},
{
    487.32,491.22
     This is the platinum model which is nice because you could use it all over the body, right?
},
{
    491.64,493.56
     But again
},
{
    493.56,497.28
     What I like about a brad it doesn't have to conform completely to your bottom
},
{
    497.6,500.82
     In order because it's going to go through no matter what, right?
},
{
    500.82,506.24
     Whether it's an airspace, right, you're going to get that two and a half inches or close to it of depth
},
{
    506.36,511.12
     Right and that to me there's certain cases where something like this really pays for itself
},
{
    511.12,517.34
     And this is one of them because you're just not gonna get deep enough with regular heat, right so all right moving on
},
{
    518.04,524.02
     Number four you could actually try a combination of the two, because again we're trying to calm those muscles down
},
{
    524.02,528.7
     So contrast, yep contrast, we could do the heat and then you could do the ice
},
{
    528.7,533.68
     So I don't know how long would you, the heat probably it takes like 10 minutes for this to warm up
},
{
    534.56,539.74
     So I would probably have it on for about 45 minutes. I mean again you could sit on it so you can
},
{
    540.26,545.76
     Right watch TV, read a book, and then you can throw the ice on for maybe 20 minutes.
},
{
    545.76,547.92
     Right, I don't think you need to go more than that.
},
{
    547.92,552.2
     But if it was me, I would always finish with a cold pack.
},
{
    552.2,555.4
     But you can do it however works best for you.
},
{
    555.4,558.2
     Yeah, you want to experiment to see what works best for you.
},
{
    558.2,563.32
     And number five, you're going to want to try to eventually set up like a sitting schedule.
},
{
    563.32,565.78
     You want to see, you know, when it starts to feel a little bit better
},
{
    566.36,571.7
     Start sitting and when it starts to hurt you get up, no longer and you might even keep a chart
},
{
    571.72,578.16
     Sure, you know how long you can go and maybe what sitting surface you were on right when you were doing this
},
{
    578.16,582.48
     They could make an app for this. I think there actually is an app for this Brad. Really?
},
{
    582.48,585.1
     It's amazing. Believe it or not. Appers do
},
{
    585.7,592.26
     So if after you do all those things things just don't go get better, you can do you know, they do have injections
},
{
    593.04,595.84
     This is not an area that I'm expert in by any means
},
{
    595.84,600.18
     But I've known therapists that were if you go to probably a larger hospital and
},
{
    600.52,603.7
     Ask do they have a pelvic floor physical therapist? Sure
},
{
    603.7,609.44
     I knew two therapists when I worked at Mayo, that's all they did is they were trying to
},
{
    609.44,611.16
     pelvic floor.
},
{
    611.16,616.32
     And they would maybe be able to help you with the muscles around it.
},
{
    616.32,622.12
     Also, I think there are some osteopats or chiropractors that actually do manipulation of the bones.
},
{
    622.12,631.08
     Yeah, I've heard of that too and it's Not invasive, it's a little. Yeah, and number four a last resort by all means would be surgery
},
{
    631.08,636.44
     I think they actually go in and actually remove the coccyx sometimes. Sure, and I think that's pretty rare
},
{
    636.44,643.54
     It is pretty rare, but it is done right sometimes. All right Brad, I think we got out through all of them
},
{
    643.54,646.72
     Wow, we got through it once again Bob, once again
},
{
    646.72,649.8
     I'm thinking this could help cause
},
{
    650.12,651.62
     Fard dilemma
},
{
    651.62,655.08
     Well, I mean for our Brad and I can fix this about anything
},
{
    655.08,658.56
     We're working hard, right, but I'm thinking this can help somehow
},
{
    658.56,661.0
     I'm not sure how that would help, how would that help?
},
{
    661.0,664.0
     I'll think about it, Brad, how would that help?
},
{
    664.0,665.76
     Just really, thanks for watching.
},
