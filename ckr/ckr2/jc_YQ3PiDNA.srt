     I got through it, Brad.
},
{
    70.72,72.08
     Yeah, excellent job, Bob.
},
{
    72.08,72.92
     All right, thanks.
},
{
    72.92,73.76
     Shall we continue?
},
{
    73.76,74.6
     Yes, let's go.
},
{
    74.6,78.0
     All right, so neck pain is oftentimes associated
},
{
    78.0,79.72
     with a stiff neck.
},
{
    79.72,81.24
     And not only that, particularly,
},
{
    81.24,84.08
     I had three patients had very similar symptoms
},
{
    84.08,86.9
     and we've heard these complaints over the years.
},
{
    86.9,88.94
     Many times it's very common.
},
{
    88.94,93.94
     Neck pain oftentimes refers down into the scapular area.
},
{
    94.72,96.76
     Sometimes down into the shoulder blade.
},
{
    96.76,97.96
     Yep, shoulder blade here.
},
{
    97.96,100.0
     And that's what all three of these were.
},
{
    100.0,103.64
     Neck pain down into the scapular or the shoulder blade area.
},
{
    103.64,106.24
     Oftentimes one side, not the other.
},
{
    106.24,107.8
     It could be both sides.
},
{
    107.8,110.84
     And all three of these people were limited
},
{
    110.84,114.76
     with range of motion, right and left rotation,
},
{
    114.76,117.2
     one side's typically worse than the other.
},
{
    117.2,119.76
     And then say, can you look up to the ceiling like this?
},
{
    119.76,123.04
     And all of them were like, that hurts.
},
{
    124.0,125.12
     It was a very typical. Right. And a lot of times they feel, well hurts. Which is very typical.
},
{
    125.12,126.84
     Right, and a lot of times they feel,
},
{
    126.84,128.68
     well, because it hurts, I shouldn't do it.
},
{
    128.68,132.2
     Right, and I had one patient,
},
{
    132.2,134.52
     he's been taking his IV a profen,
},
{
    134.52,136.08
     he's been doing some stretching.
},
{
    136.08,139.52
     He had a 10s unit from another injury, he tried there.
},
{
    139.52,141.48
     He says, nothing's working.
},
{
    141.48,143.52
     So I said, well, let's give this a try.
},
{
    143.52,144.36
     Let's give this a go.
},
{
    144.36,146.8
     Okay, so now all three of these people,
},
{
    146.8,149.92
     I used all, this is the same exercise,
},
{
    149.92,152.4
     but various options, three variations.
},
{
    152.4,154.76
     So just kind of hold, hold with me.
},
{
    154.76,156.8
     And if you try one of these three,
},
{
    156.8,159.84
     there's a good chance that you're gonna increase
},
{
    159.84,163.08
     your range of motion and decrease your pain.
},
{
    163.08,166.68
     Yeah, actually Brad, I saw a study that was done all across
},
{
    166.68,168.8
     that if you increase your extension,
},
{
    168.8,170.32
     you also increase your rotations.
},
{
    170.32,171.2
     Yep, yep.
},
{
    171.2,174.4
     So by the way, should we mention that if you should
},
{
    174.4,177.56
     never do this, if it makes you dizzy or lightheaded,
},
{
    177.56,180.24
     right, you know, you're gonna hold off then
},
{
    180.24,182.52
     and you're gonna wanna have a professional work with that.
},
{
    182.52,184.24
     Yeah, you're gonna go on and seek some help.
},
{
    184.24,186.16
     Yeah. Good point, Bob. The next thing is you need wanna have a professional. Yeah, you're gonna go on and seek some help. Good point, Bob.
},
{
    186.16,189.44
     The next thing is you need to have a chair
},
{
    189.44,192.52
     with a backrest that is low enough.
},
{
    192.52,194.36
     Now this one is just about,
},
{
    194.36,196.04
     I wouldn't want any higher than this.
},
{
    196.04,198.96
     It's nice if it can go below the shoulder blades, actually.
},
{
    198.96,201.0
     Just right below the shoulder blades.
},
{
    201.0,203.48
     This one kinda hits you right on the tip, doesn't it?
},
{
    203.48,205.28
     But it works because it rotates.
},
{
    205.28,206.12
     It rotates, yeah.
},
{
    206.12,206.96
     And it'll work.
},
{
    206.96,207.8
     It's right on the borderline.
},
{
    207.8,209.14
     You can do it on a stiff back,
},
{
    209.14,210.24
     but it should be lower than.
},
{
    210.24,211.08
     Yeah.
},
{
    211.08,212.48
     One of these office chairs really work well.
},
{
    212.48,213.48
     They're a little cushiony.
},
{
    213.48,214.52
     Yeah, they're low cushions.
},
{
    214.52,216.0
     Yeah, they kind of work.
},
{
    216.0,216.84
     It's important.
},
{
    216.84,218.4
     That's why we want to emphasize that.
},
{
    218.4,219.64
     And then the repetition,
},
{
    219.64,221.88
     so we remember it as,
},
{
    221.88,225.84
     you usually five, no more than 10 repetitions at a time.
},
{
    225.84,229.0
     And as long as the pain gets better
},
{
    229.0,231.32
     and the motion improves,
},
{
    231.32,233.68
     you can do it as much as one time per hour
},
{
    233.68,234.52
     and get rid of this.
},
{
    234.52,236.08
     Yeah, I think that's a good point, Brad,
},
{
    236.08,237.76
     because a lot of people think that
},
{
    237.76,239.64
     I'm gonna do this my exercise once a day,
},
{
    239.64,240.48
     like I'm supposed to.
},
{
    240.48,243.96
     It's like, no, you would really wanna do this quite often.
},
{
    243.96,247.24
     I mean, five to seven times, five to eight times a day.
},
{
    247.24,249.8
     And that's where you're gonna see some gains made.
},
{
    249.8,250.64
     Right.
},
{
    250.64,252.56
     There's one more thing I know you're interested,
},
{
    252.56,254.16
     you really want to start seeing the exercise,
},
{
    254.16,257.0
     but all these are absolutely critical to be successful.
},
{
    257.0,260.52
     Is monitor your posture while you're sitting,
},
{
    260.52,263.7
     particularly at a computer watching TV in your car.
},
{
    263.7,265.5
     Because if you do these exercises
},
{
    265.5,268.9
     and you go back to head forward slouch posture,
},
{
    268.9,269.9
     it's just gonna-
},
{
    269.9,270.82
     It's gonna come right back.
},
{
    270.82,272.46
     One step forward, two steps back.
},
{
    272.46,273.3
     That's critical.
},
{
    273.3,274.62
     You won't be able to stay ahead of it.
},
{
    274.62,275.46
     Right.
},
{
    275.46,277.7
     Okay, now I need to take my mic off,
},
{
    277.7,279.9
     so then you don't have to list the me talk anymore.
},
{
    279.9,281.26
     Bob gets to do all the talking.
},
{
    281.26,283.42
     If you say something, Brad, I'll just repeat it.
},
{
    283.42,284.62
     I mean, if there's something I miss.
},
{
    284.62,285.44
     Right, right, that'll be entertaining mean, if there's something I miss. Right, right.
},
{
    285.44,287.4
     That'll be entertaining in itself.
},
{
    287.4,288.24
     It's like a puppet.
},
{
    288.24,290.56
     Yup, so because what happens is
},
{
    290.56,292.48
     we're gonna use a towel roll first.
},
{
    292.48,296.6
     It binds up with the wires and everything else.
},
{
    296.6,299.48
     So I'll just talk and it'll be like a mime.
},
{
    299.48,300.32
     Yeah.
},
{
    301.82,303.08
     I got that out of it.
},
{
    303.08,304.88
     What a wonderful world.
},
{
    304.88,306.6
     Okay, so he's gonna take the towel,
},
{
    306.6,308.32
     he's gonna roll it up,
},
{
    308.32,311.28
     he's got a quite heavy thick towel here.
},
{
    311.28,313.32
     And you have just like the old days
},
{
    313.32,316.82
     where you used to snap his buddy's butts.
},
{
    316.82,317.66
     Yeah.
},
{
    318.88,320.88
     So he's actually in this case,
},
{
    320.88,322.22
     cause there's a couple ways you can do this,
},
{
    322.22,324.48
     but he's actually pulling down.
},
{
    324.48,331.92
     And you can work a little bit on the level that you're putting it, but generally we just start
},
{
    331.92,338.24
     right at the base of the deck. And what you'll find is a lot of times without a towel, you can't do it.
},
{
    338.24,344.56
     It just hurts too much. And most patients I have have to use the towel to start. And they always
},
{
    344.56,346.24
     seem to really enjoy the fact
},
{
    346.24,348.68
     that all of a sudden they can start moving back.
},
{
    348.68,352.2
     And you may not be able to go that far to start,
},
{
    352.2,355.32
     you'll be able to go farther than without the towel.
},
{
    355.32,359.32
     But yeah, just take the movement that it allows.
},
{
    359.32,361.0
     So maybe for a couple of days,
},
{
    361.0,363.96
     you're only gonna go about 50% of how far,
},
{
    363.96,365.16
     the total amount. But eventually, you wanna only gonna go about 50% of how far, you know, the total amount.
},
{
    365.16,367.08
     But eventually, you know, you wanna see
},
{
    367.08,368.88
     if you can get further and further.
},
{
    371.4,374.44
     Yeah, so what Brad is saying is a lot of times,
},
{
    374.44,376.5
     you start, instead of just going back,
},
{
    376.5,380.66
     we start getting your posture correct by chin tucking,
},
{
    380.66,383.32
     tucking the chin in and then going back.
},
{
    383.32,387.08
     Cause what we don't want is somebody going like this.
},
{
    387.08,390.24
     So that's why we chin tuck and go back.
},
{
    390.24,391.08
     So.
},
{
    395.16,397.64
     So we're not having good success with this.
},
{
    397.64,399.08
     If we're not having good success with this
},
{
    399.08,400.52
     then the next step, I'm sorry Bob,
},
{
    400.52,402.68
     I can't just let you do it.
},
{
    402.68,406.0
     We're gonna go to, you can use a belt.
},
{
    406.0,407.0
     Usually not a slip belt.
},
{
    407.0,408.52
     Are you hearing, a little closer.
},
{
    408.52,410.2
     Little closer, oh, how about that?
},
{
    410.2,412.4
     Hello, and then, look at,
},
{
    412.4,413.24
     you can use a belt.
},
{
    413.24,416.12
     Yeah, a strap that has cloth,
},
{
    416.12,417.96
     versus a shiny one.
},
{
    417.96,419.68
     Okay. Oh, these are sensitive.
},
{
    419.68,420.52
     Yeah.
},
{
    420.52,421.76
     Oh, Bob, I'll let you go.
},
{
    421.76,425.6
     All right, so he's got, I mean, you could use a belt too.
},
{
    425.6,428.4
     I mean, I've done it with a belt actually.
},
{
    428.4,431.16
     What Brad was saying is it's nicer if they're very thin
},
{
    431.16,434.08
     because then you can really get onto specific levels
},
{
    434.08,436.92
     of the neck and you can,
},
{
    436.92,439.76
     because sometimes you'll find out that it works out
},
{
    439.76,441.64
     really well, quite low.
},
{
    441.64,444.56
     Sometimes it's better doing it further up.
},
{
    444.56,446.72
     And so you can vary and figure out
},
{
    447.68,454.0
     which which level actually works for you. How do you know it's the right level?
},
{
    454.88,461.68
     It actually feels better. I mean that and the more range right it's going to allow you to move
},
{
    461.68,465.36
     further. So right now Brad moved it up a little further
},
{
    465.36,467.4
     and there you go.
},
{
    467.4,470.0
     He's about an inch at a time
},
{
    470.0,471.9
     and he's starting to pull down.
},
{
    473.96,476.24
     Yeah, and now he's starting to get more motion.
},
{
    480.6,482.82
     All right, so yeah, Brad's mentioned
},
{
    482.82,484.92
     that all three of the people he worked with,
},
{
    484.92,488.14
     there was definitely a specific level
},
{
    488.14,489.16
     that worked better.
},
{
    491.16,492.76
     And one was up higher, yes.
},
{
    492.76,495.7
     And I found, yeah, I found that myself sometimes,
},
{
    495.7,497.42
     but yeah, a lot of times you,
},
{
    497.42,500.08
     normally the stress is on the lower neck,
},
{
    500.08,504.36
     but I've seen it myself too, where sometimes,
},
{
    504.36,506.44
     are you getting feedback?
},
{
    506.44,507.88
     You're hitting the mic, Brad.
},
{
    507.88,512.72
     So, okay.
},
{
    514.04,517.32
     And now he's actually gonna go the other direction.
},
{
    517.32,519.76
     And this is a different variation.
},
{
    519.76,523.06
     The joints actually are angled like this.
},
{
    523.06,526.12
     So he's gonna kind of go along with the joint itself.
},
{
    526.12,528.22
     And then he's gonna actually,
},
{
    528.22,529.64
     when he's going back like this,
},
{
    529.64,531.76
     you see his hands are moving along with him.
},
{
    531.76,533.24
     He's not just doing this.
},
{
    533.24,534.56
     He's not doing this and not go back.
},
{
    534.56,536.2
     Yeah, he's going with it.
},
{
    536.2,540.9
     The eyes are staying level with the fists or the thumbs.
},
{
    540.9,544.56
     So this is another variation on how you can do it.
},
{
    544.56,549.52
     I was going to do the thumbs it. That's a good cue.
},
{
    549.52,551.16
     So he said if you put the thumbs out,
},
{
    551.16,552.32
     they point right into your eyes
},
{
    552.32,555.16
     and they should stay with the eyes.
},
{
    555.16,557.44
     And again, you can try different levels
},
{
    557.44,559.24
     using the center strap.
},
{
    560.24,564.28
     But this one, you know, I'd start with the thicker one.
},
{
    564.28,565.4
     Got the mic here. You start with the thicker one. Got the mic here.
},
{
    567.24,568.88
     You start with the thicker one.
},
{
    568.88,571.2
     He's going back on.
},
{
    571.2,574.06
     And then usually if you can try a thinner one,
},
{
    574.06,575.56
     it's gonna often help.
},
{
    575.56,576.9
     Can you hear me Liz?
},
{
    576.9,578.12
     Everything's okay.
},
{
    578.12,579.48
     Why was really hard, Bob?
},
{
    579.48,581.04
     Yeah, I was.
},
{
    581.04,584.28
     It's like I've had patients that can't speak our language.
},
{
    584.28,585.96
     I've used interpreters.
},
{
    585.96,587.28
     And I think, oh, it's just terrible.
},
{
    587.28,588.96
     Yeah, it's challenging.
},
{
    588.96,593.28
     So you're gonna show one more with the,
},
{
    593.28,594.64
     with the attraction, right?
},
{
    595.64,597.52
     Nope, we just did that one.
},
{
    597.52,599.72
     Oh, I see that's, I see what you're saying.
},
{
    599.72,600.56
     Okay.
},
{
    600.56,601.4
     That, that, that,
},
{
    601.4,602.24
     because you're pulling,
},
{
    602.24,603.08
     you're pulling up,
},
{
    603.08,605.64
     it actually almost gives a little traction. Right, right.
},
{
    605.64,607.44
     It's about what we're trying to make.
},
{
    607.44,608.78
     Exactly.
},
{
    608.78,609.62
     Yeah.
},
{
    609.62,612.0
     Yeah, give these a try, experiment around with them.
},
{
    612.0,615.72
     Always remember though, it should be no pain
},
{
    615.72,618.36
     or less, certainly less pain than you would be doing it
},
{
    618.36,620.28
     if you were doing it without using the device.
},
{
    620.28,621.76
     Right, with repetition.
},
{
    622.76,623.76
     You're always gonna be pretty safe
},
{
    623.76,627.6
     if you keep that no pain credoedle, and no dizziness.
},
{
    627.6,628.88
     And you know, so.
},
{
    628.88,629.72
     Lightheadedness.
},
{
    629.72,633.84
     Those are critical red flags to watch out for.
},
{
    633.84,635.88
     And remember, Brad and I are not just pretty.
},
{
    635.88,638.4
     Oh yeah, we're pretty ugly.
},
{
    638.4,640.08
     Yeah, now we're pretty handy.
},
