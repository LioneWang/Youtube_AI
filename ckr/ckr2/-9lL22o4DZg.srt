},
{
    13.88,14.88
     Hi, seriously?
},
{
    14.88,15.88
     Where have you been?

{
    15.88,16.88
     I'm starving.
},
{
    16.88,17.88
     Filming with Josh today.
},
{
    17.88,18.88
     I told you this.
},
{
    18.88,19.88
     Oh, oh yeah.
},
{
    19.88,25.54
     The guy that gets drunk and hits on me in the parking lot. Where have you been? I'm starving. Filming with Josh today. I told you this.
},
{
    25.54,29.84
     Oh, oh yeah. The guy that gets drunk and hits on me in the parking lot.
},
{
    29.84,32.0
     Was he as drunk as when I agreed to marry you?
},
{
    32.0,34.5
     Please, are you serious? No one's ever been that drunk.
},
{
    34.5,38.8
     Looking at choking in the adult, believe it or not, alcohol is oftentimes involved.
},
{
    38.8,43.0
     Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant and appetite stimulant.
},
{
    42.8,48.54
     nervous system depressant and appetite stimulant.
},
{
    50.12,51.46
     Seriously, it's about time.
},
{
    53.16,54.04
     I'm sorry, she's a psychotic.
},
{
    57.06,58.06
     Oh my God, slow down, you're gonna start choking.
},
{
    60.3,63.3
     Oh my God, it's like you've never eaten before. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
},
{
    63.3,64.8
     Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
},
{
    64.8,75.04
     Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. So here you have your pain in the ass wife or husband sitting right across from you choking
},
{
    75.04,77.0
     to death.
},
{
    77.0,83.24
     Nah, we took an oath, we still gotta do something.
},
{
    83.24,86.84
     Now you can't work a choking victim if they're sitting in a restaurant booth, you gotta get
},
{
    86.84,88.4
     them out of the booth.
},
{
    88.4,91.96
     So get your victim out of the booth, explain what you're gonna do to them because they're
},
{
    91.96,93.4
     freaking out.
},
{
    93.4,97.36
     Anytime you have your airway blocked, a little thing goes off in your brain that says, hey,
},
{
    97.36,98.64
     you're about to die.
},
{
    98.64,102.8
     So these people may be really freaking out, so communicate with them, go hey, I know the
},
{
    102.8,108.42
     Heimlich maneuver, I'm going to help you. Next, position yourself behind the patient. Find either the
},
{
    108.42,112.4
     umbilicus, the belly button, or you can zip down till you find the xyphoid
},
{
    112.4,116.88
     process and come about three fingers below that. Make a fist with your other
},
{
    116.88,120.64
     hand. Remember you're going to put your thumb into the abdomen. This has to come
},
{
    120.64,124.0
     underneath the diaphragm and the direction you're going to push is upward,
},
{
    124.0,126.44
     like you're aiming toward the back of their neck.
},
{
    126.44,130.2
     Sharp, deliberate, right toward the back of the neck,
},
{
    130.2,131.3
     in and upward.
},
{
    134.44,136.82
     Now before we talk about doing abdominal thrust
},
{
    136.82,140.64
     to remove an obstruction from a conscious adult victim,
},
{
    140.64,142.04
     let's look at breathing first.
},
{
    142.04,143.92
     How do people breathe?
},
{
    143.92,146.0
     Well, we breathe, take air in and
},
{
    146.0,151.88
     out of the body, mostly through contracture of the diaphragm. Your diaphragm sets transverse,
},
{
    151.88,156.32
     separates the chest from the belly, right? Now here's what happens. Your diaphragm contracts
},
{
    156.32,162.36
     and it drops down. And like a vacuum, you passively suck air in. The diaphragm comes
},
{
    162.36,165.72
     up and air comes out of the lungs. So it's a diaphragm
},
{
    165.72,170.3
     going up and down that moves air in and out. So when we're doing those abdominal
},
{
    170.3,174.24
     thrusts, we're really not doing abdominal thrusts. We want to be doing diaphragm
},
{
    174.24,177.76
     thrusts. We got to get that diaphragm moving upward. However, the only way to
},
{
    177.76,181.3
     get to the diaphragm from the outside is through the abdomen. That's why we do
},
{
    181.3,188.16
     abdominal thrusts. But remember, important, the direction you have to go, upward. Gotta move that diaphragm up, increase the
},
{
    188.16,192.06
     pressure in the chest, knock that hot dog out of her throat. Now you're going to
},
{
    192.06,196.26
     continue to do abdominal thrust, continue to do the Heimlich maneuver until
},
{
    196.26,201.36
     either the obstruction comes up or the patient becomes unconscious. Call 911,
},
{
    201.36,205.6
     get some help. Now once your patient is unconscious first active
},
{
    205.6,211.16
     ADMS call 911 get some professional help coming. Next open up that mouth take a
},
{
    211.16,214.44
     peek inside that mouth and if you can find the obstruction pull it out of
},
{
    214.44,218.36
     there. If you can't no blind finger sweeping you can actually push it further
},
{
    218.36,225.1
     down. Next begin chest compressions standard Standard CPR, 30 to two.
},
{
    225.1,227.1
     Again, you're gonna compress about two inches
},
{
    227.1,229.54
     at a rate of 100, so standard CPR.
},
{
    233.06,236.34
     However, every time before you put the breath
},
{
    236.34,238.4
     into the victim, open up that mouth
},
{
    238.4,239.24
     and take a look in there,
},
{
    239.24,241.76
     and if you see the obstruction, pull it out.
},
{
    241.76,244.04
     Between the chest compressions and the ventilations,
},
{
    244.04,249.48
     we may have loosened that obstruction. We may be able to pull it out of Between the chest compressions and the ventilations we may have loosened that obstruction we may be able to pull it out of their mouth now.
