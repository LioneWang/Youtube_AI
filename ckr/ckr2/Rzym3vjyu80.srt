     Bob and Brad, the two most famous physical therapists on the internet.
},
{
    9.0,13.0
     Hi, I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist, Brad Heineck physical therapist.
},
{
    13.0,15.0
     Together we are the most famous physical therapists on the internet.
},
{
    15.0,16.0
     In our opinion of course, Bob.
},
{
    16.0,21.0
     Brad, this has happened to probably almost all of us. You're getting up at night, you stub your toe,
},
{
    21.0,26.0
     and what should you do after that? Do you need to see a doctor? Is it broken?
},
{
    26.0,26.84
     How do you treat it?
},
{
    26.84,28.64
     So we're gonna try to give you some guidelines.
},
{
    28.64,29.68
     And that hurts, Bob.
},
{
    29.68,31.08
     Oh, it hurts, because I've done it.
},
{
    31.08,33.8
     Yeah, it feels like it's broken, all of them.
},
{
    33.8,35.56
     But a lot of times it's not.
},
{
    35.56,37.88
     Yeah, and I'll go through my scenario too,
},
{
    37.88,38.72
     whether what happened.
},
{
    38.72,40.48
     But when you stub your toe,
},
{
    40.48,43.36
     if you first hear like a pop or a snap,
},
{
    43.36,45.0
     there's more likely that you broke it.
},
{
    45.0,52.12
     Okay. If you hear the sound. If you look at the toe and it's bent, I mean I may see obvious but
},
{
    52.12,58.08
     to some people they may not think of it. If it's kind of bent one side or another it's probably
},
{
    58.08,68.0
     broke and you need to go in then. If there's bruising and swelling the next day, doesn't mean it's broke, but it's getting more likely.
},
{
    68.0,72.0
     Even if there's bruising and swelling in the toenail,
},
{
    72.0,76.0
     it's getting more likely. Mine did bruise up. I don't know if mine was ever broke, to be honest.
},
{
    76.0,80.0
     I didn't go in. But if it keeps going on
},
{
    80.0,84.0
     for several days, you need to go in, if the pain
},
{
    84.0,85.6
     and the swelling.
},
{
    85.6,87.28
     Not that they're gonna put a cast on it,
},
{
    87.28,89.88
     but there may be some treatment to help it out.
},
{
    89.88,92.2
     Right, and there are kinds of times,
},
{
    92.2,94.68
     if it's broken to the joint,
},
{
    94.68,98.36
     you're more susceptible to early arthritis,
},
{
    98.36,100.8
     so you wanna have a treated right.
},
{
    100.8,103.84
     And sometimes if there's really pinpoint pain,
},
{
    103.84,107.2
     that means it's broke too, as opposed to really diffuse and spread out.
},
{
    107.2,113.54
     Sure. So the statement that if you can walk on it, it's not broken. That's not true.
},
{
    113.54,118.0
     You might be able to walk on it and it's still broken, so don't be relying on that.
},
{
    118.0,120.66
     Sure. So what are you going to do for treatment?
},
{
    120.66,129.9
     You know, the first thing you want to probably, you know, keep the weight off the toe for a while. Using crutches or a cane or something just trying to feel rice.
},
{
    129.9,136.28
     Rest it, ice it. Yeah, elevation. It's kind of hard to compress it. It's kind of hard to wrap.
},
{
    136.28,140.16
     Yeah, worry about the C which is compression. I went through that. But yeah,
},
{
    140.16,145.04
     I'd go ahead and ice it. The thing that I did, and a lot of people will do,
},
{
    145.04,149.44
     they'll take tape, and so let's say this is the broken toe,
},
{
    149.44,152.56
     they'll tape it to the toe right next to them.
},
{
    152.56,155.16
     They just go ahead and buddy split that they call it.
},
{
    155.16,156.0
     Sure.
},
{
    156.0,158.12
     So they tape them together in a comfortable way
},
{
    158.12,160.52
     so you don't get tingling or numbness,
},
{
    160.52,161.36
     and you hold them together,
},
{
    161.36,162.96
     and that kind of supports that one.
},
{
    162.96,165.36
     And don't tape it too tight just right
},
{
    165.88,168.92
     It's gotta be loose. Yeah, just so they're held together
},
{
    168.92,173.88
     Yeah, it should be comfortable and you don't want to see your toes turning right don't let your brother take the
},
{
    173.98,178.68
     Electricians tape and tighten it up good and tight. You sound like you have an experience with that
},
{
    178.68,184.76
     So all right the next thing you're gonna do is you're gonna go ahead and what this just happened to my daughter in fact
},
{
    184.0,185.0
     The next thing you're going to do is you're going to go ahead and this just happened to my daughter in fact.
},
{
    185.0,190.76
     What we had her do is she took an old tennis shoe and she cut out the toe here.
},
{
    190.76,195.4
     Can you see that Lonnie?
},
{
    195.4,200.24
     Down.
},
{
    200.24,206.44
     And that took pressure off the toe because a lot of times you put your foot in a shoe
},
{
    206.44,208.68
     and it's going to be that constant pressure on your toe.
},
{
    208.68,212.24
     Right, especially if it's swollen up, it's tender and then you're just going to irritate it.
},
{
    212.24,218.44
     Even better is what we call, I don't know, we call them a reshoe, R-E-E-S-E shoe.
},
{
    218.44,222.08
     But this has an open toe, it's after surgery.
},
{
    222.08,228.64
     And what's nice about this, the sole soul is real stiff down bring it down a tall guy
},
{
    229.16,233.12
     So it's real stiff so the toes not bending when you step on right
},
{
    235.16,241.26
     You can clearly see the toes exposed and a nice thing about this if you do bump it with any luck
},
{
    241.28,246.16
     You hit this and you protect the right? toe. We call them ortho shoes.
},
{
    246.16,249.84
     Okay. We call them re-shoes. Yeah it's just a brand name. Call whatever you want.
},
{
    249.84,253.8
     They're nice you can get them at a lot of pharmacies will have them. Yeah you
},
{
    253.8,257.36
     can probably order online very easily too. So the last thing I want to talk
},
{
    257.36,262.68
     about Brad is if let's say three four weeks have gone by and it wasn't broken
},
{
    262.68,265.2
     and you're still having some pain because this is what
},
{
    265.2,266.2
     happened to me.
},
{
    266.2,269.24
     And I was like, why am I still having pain?
},
{
    269.24,273.68
     And what turned out is I think quite often when you injure the toe, you also injure the
},
{
    273.68,275.16
     tendon.
},
{
    275.16,281.64
     And so the tendon that runs along the toe and it gets there's some scar tissue in it.
},
{
    281.64,283.52
     So Brad's going to show on his toe.
},
{
    283.52,290.32
     I'm not taking my sock off. Okay, right along there. So what we do, which we often do is for like, I think like
},
{
    290.32,294.76
     this, we do cross fiber massage. So I'm gonna come back up to you. Am I too high
},
{
    294.76,299.96
     again? Right about there. So you just really kind of aggressively you're gonna
},
{
    299.96,304.96
     go across the tendon, especially if you find a tender spot. Okay Bob, I'm taking
},
{
    304.96,305.92
     my sock off.
},
{
    305.92,307.48
     You can't do it to your finger.
},
{
    307.48,308.32
     Yes you can.
},
{
    308.32,309.36
     Well, I know, but look at this.
},
{
    309.36,311.08
     All you do this for like five minutes.
},
{
    311.08,313.4
     I did two treatments of it and the pain was gone.
},
{
    313.4,314.68
     So you just went like this?
},
{
    314.68,315.52
     Yep.
},
{
    315.52,317.64
     Right over the toe, just so you can do it with your thumb.
},
{
    317.64,318.48
     Yep.
},
{
    318.48,319.36
     Really aggressive.
},
{
    319.36,320.8
     You're breaking up the scar tissue
},
{
    320.8,322.88
     and then that scar tissue doesn't give you any pain.
},
{
    322.88,328.3
     Yeah, so by this time that your toe was not so painful the swelling was down yeah there
},
{
    328.3,332.68
     was just some tight scars. There were some ugly toes. Yeah that is. That happened when you
},
{
    332.68,337.98
     get over 50. It's terrible. Thanks for watching folks.
},
