     Welcome back everyone today. I'm going to show you some exercises and stretches that help you fix or reduce your anterior pelvic tilt
},
{
    7.24,11.6
     anterior pelvic tilt is where the hips are rotated forward anteriorly and
},
{
    11.84,14.92
     posterior pelvic tilt is where your hips are rotated backwards
},
{
    15.36,22.96
     posteriorly with anterior pelvic tilt when it rotates forward your stomach sticks out and bulges out and makes it look nice and big
},
{
    22.96,27.0
     And we don't want that right and it also adds a lot of pressure and tightness
},
{
    27.0,28.6
     in the front of the hips
},
{
    28.6,31.0
     and also the lower back at the same time.
},
{
    31.0,33.84
     So there's a lot of pressure and stiffness in these areas
},
{
    33.84,36.92
     causing you to maybe have a bit of pain in the front of the hips
},
{
    36.92,38.9
     and pain in the lower back.
},
{
    38.9,41.48
     As it rotates forward like so,
},
{
    41.48,44.16
     it also lengthens your hamstrings.
},
{
    44.16,48.0
     So just walking around, your hamstrings are constantly tight
},
{
    48.0,50.38
     due to the lengthening of the hamstrings
},
{
    50.38,52.04
     because it's nice and taut.
},
{
    52.04,53.92
     So all those times that you could be spending
},
{
    53.92,56.8
     stretching your hamstring, thinking that your hamstrings
},
{
    56.8,58.32
     are tight because they're shortened,
},
{
    58.32,61.28
     it could be caused by anterior pelvic tail.
},
{
    61.28,63.8
     So give these exercises and stretches a go
},
{
    63.8,65.36
     and hopefully they'll help you as much as they
},
{
    65.36,66.0
     helped me.
},
{
    70.56,75.76
     Foam rolling. Foam rolling the quadriceps and the hip flexors. I'll leave a link in the
},
{
    75.76,81.04
     description box below on where to get a foam roller. First you would need a foam roller and if you
},
{
    81.04,85.48
     have a high pain tolerance you can use a PVC pipe.
},
{
    85.48,90.74
     Place it on the ground and allow your thigh to lay on top of it, where your main muscle
},
{
    90.74,91.74
     belly is.
},
{
    91.74,96.3
     Now roll up and down the thigh in a nice and slow, controlled manner.
},
{
    96.3,101.2
     Try to work all the way from the end of the quadriceps just above your kneecap and to the
},
{
    101.2,106.08
     top of the muscles where it attaches just below the hip bone. Remember
},
{
    106.08,110.92
     the quadriceps are on the inner and outer parts of your thighs. So I want you to roll
},
{
    110.92,116.22
     over these parts as well. Just roll on each thigh for about 1 to 3 minutes or you can
},
{
    116.22,120.44
     stop when you notice the thigh is no longer tender. And move on to the next thigh. However
},
{
    120.44,126.06
     with this technique I don't want you to force yourself to feel pain, as it can cause bruising and injury.
},
{
    126.06,127.94
     Hip flexor release with the lacrosse ball.
},
{
    127.94,131.76
     I'll leave a link in the description box below on where to get a massage ball.
},
{
    131.76,136.08
     Just place the lacrosse ball in front of your hip just off the hip bone towards your abdomen.
},
{
    136.08,140.14
     This is where the hip flexor is located, also known as the zoas muscle.
},
{
    140.14,141.38
     Just lay on top of the ball.
},
{
    141.38,147.48
     You may feel more pressure on the heart floor, as opposed to carpeted floor or if you're like me, on foam floor.
},
{
    147.48,151.24
     Since carpeted floor and foam flooring has more give.
},
{
    151.24,157.44
     Pivot over this muscle or a tender spot back and forth for about 20 strokes and then move
},
{
    157.44,159.36
     on to the next tender spot.
},
{
    159.36,163.4
     To add more pressure on the ball and the hip flexor, you can lift up your knee off the
},
{
    163.4,166.82
     floor and allow the weight of your leg to pivot over the ball and the hip flexor, you can lift up your knee off the floor and allow the weight of your leg to pivot over the ball.
},
{
    166.82,170.28
     This will create more pressure on the area that you are trying to massage.
},
{
    170.28,174.48
     I find this is the most effective way to massage out your hip flexor muscle.
},
{
    174.48,179.52
     However, please be mindful there are anatomical structures that you need to be avoiding, or
},
{
    179.52,183.6
     else you'll be injuring the femoral artery, the femoral vein and the femoral nerve in
},
{
    183.6,184.6
     this area.
},
{
    184.6,188.84
     If you still feel like this technique is not working for you, try rolling up and down the
},
{
    188.84,190.52
     muscle belly instead.
},
{
    190.52,196.12
     Do this for about 20 strokes 2-3 times on each hip flexor.
},
{
    196.12,198.28
     Lunge Hip Flexor Stretch.
},
{
    198.28,203.24
     Go into a kneeling lunge position and try to have all your knee joints starting out in
},
{
    203.24,205.04
     a squared bent position.
},
{
    205.04,211.64
     I like to have something soft under the knee to support my knee, especially if I'm working on a hard floor like a folded towel.
},
{
    211.92,217.88
     But in this case, I'm on a foam floor, so I won't be using a soft towel to save my knees from hurting.
},
{
    217.88,221.14
     Now to incenture this stretch to fix anterior hip tilt,
},
{
    221.14,225.12
     don't stretch your hips with the anterior hip tilt position,
},
{
    225.12,227.54
     where your hips are rotated forward.
},
{
    227.54,232.28
     So instead, be mindful of the positioning of your hips and rotate your hips back in
},
{
    232.28,236.92
     a posterior tilt position, a bit like tucking your tailbone backwards.
},
{
    236.92,242.52
     This will promote posterior hip tilt and combat the opposing position, the anterior hip tilt.
},
{
    242.52,246.56
     Hold this stretch for about 30 seconds on each side and alternating
},
{
    246.56,251.44
     four to five times on each side. The hip flexor stretch. To accentuate this stretch for the hip
},
{
    251.44,256.24
     flexor more just raise your arm above your head bend your body over to the opposite side. This
},
{
    256.24,261.28
     will create more of a stretch in the hip flexors. The hip flexors are attached from the lumbar spine
},
{
    261.28,265.24
     to the anterior hip so to elongate the hip flexor muscle we need to pull the muscle from the lumbar spine to the anterior hip. So to elongate the hip flexor muscle,
},
{
    265.24,270.34
     we need to pull the muscle from the attachment away from its insertion by bending to the
},
{
    270.34,276.16
     opposite side. Once again, hold this position for about 30 seconds on both sides and repeat
},
{
    276.16,282.56
     the stretch on both sides for 4-5 sets. A research paper was published in 2011 on the
},
{
    282.56,290.72
     effect of supervised hip flexor stretching program on the gate of 82 elderly individuals over a 10 week period.
},
{
    290.72,294.4
     They found that the hip flexor stretching program over a 10 week period helped with
},
{
    294.4,300.44
     stride length and peak hip extension during walking in elderly adults who had limited
},
{
    300.44,305.12
     pre-intervention hip extension during walking, which means that it improved on
},
{
    305.12,309.16
     people's walking abilities and also prevented the general change in people's
},
{
    309.16,312.58
     walking. And this is why I highly recommend doing hip mobility and hip
},
{
    312.58,318.2
     stretches to help prevent you from back pain, hip pain and also improve your
},
{
    318.2,321.6
     posture and walking gait. If you still don't feel a stretch in the previous
},
{
    321.6,327.52
     techniques, just raise your foot up and bend your knee and rest it on a wall or a couch.
},
{
    327.52,329.96
     Here I'm using a bench to rest my rear foot on.
},
{
    329.96,334.24
     This will elongate the quadriceps more in the starting position creating a much more
},
{
    334.24,335.66
     aggressive stretch.
},
{
    335.66,340.22
     With the same principles like the previous stretch, keep your tailbone tucked in and
},
{
    340.22,347.36
     thrust through your hips nice and slow in a controlled manner and imagine you're pushing an arrow through your hips to the front.
},
{
    347.36,352.08
     However, I do not want you to arch your back backwards as this will create more of a back
},
{
    352.08,357.2
     extension than a hip extension and your hip extension is what we're trying to promote
},
{
    357.84,362.08
     to create a stretch in your hip flexors. You can also target the hip flexors just like the
},
{
    362.08,366.48
     previous stretch by raising your hand up and leaning over to the opposite side.
},
{
    366.48,368.88
     Assisted lower back decompression stretch.
},
{
    369.52,373.6
     Find a pole or a sturdy table leg for you to hold on to.
},
{
    373.6,375.68
     I'm using a long heavy bench.
},
{
    375.68,380.8
     This is going to help you anchor down your upper body and allow your back to decompress
},
{
    380.8,389.14
     as you lean back and allow your weight to stretch out your lumbar erectors. With this stretch I don't want you to just sit down like a beautiful
},
{
    389.14,393.28
     squat as this is going to lock your hips into anterior tilt which is what you
},
{
    393.28,398.0
     want with a body weight squat. So I want you to do exactly the opposite to a
},
{
    398.0,402.56
     beautiful body weight squat or back squat. So for the purpose of correcting
},
{
    402.56,410.72
     your anterior pelvic tilt we will be tucking our tailbone back and flattening our backs to create posterior hip tilt and decompression in
},
{
    410.72,417.36
     the lower back. I want you to sit down as deep as you can and lean back so the weight of your body
},
{
    417.36,422.8
     and your upper body will be pulling in opposite directions. Hold this position for about 1 to
},
{
    422.8,430.8
     3 minutes. If you want to create more mobility in your lower back, hips, ankles, just sway back side to side. This is a great
},
{
    430.8,436.08
     way to relieve back pain and get some movement in your joints again. I personally do this
},
{
    436.08,440.72
     as a warm up exercise before I train at the gym, just to loosen myself up. Lower back,
},
{
    440.72,445.98
     twisting stretch. Lay on the ground and pull the opposite leg over with your opposite arm.
},
{
    445.98,448.06
     Start with your knee in a bent position.
},
{
    448.06,452.5
     Try your best to keep your upper body against the floor, or if not, most of your upper back
},
{
    452.5,453.5
     against the floor.
},
{
    453.5,457.04
     With your other arm straight and outstretched in the opposite direction.
},
{
    457.04,460.92
     Sometimes you may hear some pops and cracks in this position, but it's perfectly safe.
},
{
    460.92,465.44
     However, just like how I mentioned in my previous videos, don't force these noises, these
},
{
    465.44,470.96
     pops and cracks, as it can cause some injury and pain, or loosen up areas where it shouldn't
},
{
    470.96,474.48
     be loosened, and leave the tight areas to get tighter.
},
{
    474.48,478.68
     If you want to increase the stretch in your lower back and your glutes in this position,
},
{
    478.68,483.52
     and your body permits it and there is no pain, just extend your leg out a little bit more.
},
{
    483.52,488.56
     This will create more torque in the lower back and lower back muscles in the glutes,
},
{
    488.56,495.04
     and therefore creating more of a stretch. Hold this position for about 8 long controlled breaths.
},
{
    495.04,500.96
     The longer the breath, the more effective the stretch. Do this for about 4-5 sets on both sides.
},
{
    500.96,505.36
     Glute bridges. Now you've loosened up all those spasming and tight muscles, this
},
{
    505.36,510.64
     will give us room to solidify the new range of motion with some strengthening exercises.
},
{
    510.64,515.92
     To start, we'll be doing some glute bridges. Once again, don't start off with your hips
},
{
    515.92,520.64
     in an anterior hip tilt and thrust your hips up. This will make you hyperextend your lower back
},
{
    520.64,528.68
     and over activate the lower back more than your glute muscles. Just like the previous stretches, I want you to start off by posteriorly rotating your
},
{
    528.68,534.04
     hips back and tucking your tailbone down and then thrust your hips up in a controlled manner.
},
{
    534.04,537.84
     This will strengthen your glute muscles and your core at the same time in a posterior
},
{
    537.84,538.92
     tilt position.
},
{
    538.92,544.0
     This exercise is going to help improve lower back pain, prevent lower back injuries and
},
{
    544.0,545.16
     reduce your anterior
},
{
    545.16,546.16
     hip tilt.
},
{
    546.16,550.92
     Do about 15 to 20 repetitions for 3 to 4 sets.
},
{
    550.92,557.16
     In 2015, the Journal of Physical Therapy Science published a paper on the clinical applications
},
{
    557.16,563.44
     of strengthening the muscles of the gluteus groups against doing lumbar segmental stabilization
},
{
    563.44,564.44
     exercises.
},
{
    564.44,566.88
     The results showed that there was a greater decrease
},
{
    566.88,570.4
     in lower back pain and an increase in lumbar muscle strength
},
{
    570.4,573.32
     and balance ability in the gluteus groups
},
{
    573.32,576.08
     compared to the lumbar stability exercise group.
},
{
    576.08,577.58
     This is why I emphasize so much
},
{
    577.58,579.64
     on doing glute strengthening exercises
},
{
    579.64,581.52
     with lower back exercises.
},
{
    581.52,583.44
     To prevent lower back pain,
},
{
    583.44,585.72
     strengthening the hips and lower back and prevent
},
{
    585.72,587.84
     injuries in the future.
},
{
    587.84,589.4
     Reverse ab curls.
},
{
    589.4,593.92
     A common mistake with this exercise is starting your back in an arched position.
},
{
    593.92,598.16
     So please flat in your back and rotate your hips back in a posterior tilt position by
},
{
    598.16,600.32
     tucking your tailbone back.
},
{
    600.32,605.28
     Start by lifting up your knees in a bent position whilst focusing, flattening your back against the
},
{
    605.28,612.24
     ground and in a posterior tilt position slowly and in a controlled manner, lower your feet down
},
{
    612.24,618.96
     to the ground and back up again. Do about 15 to 20 repetitions, 3 to 4 sets. If you start this
},
{
    618.96,625.32
     exercise in an anterior pelvic tilt position, it would encourage the activation of the hip flexor muscles instead
},
{
    625.32,627.44
     of the lower abdominal muscles.
},
{
    627.44,632.4
     And therefore it would increase the tightness of your hip flexor muscles and encourage anterior
},
{
    632.4,633.48
     hip tilt.
},
{
    633.48,637.04
     If you don't feel the exercise is working for you, or you want to increase the intensity
},
{
    637.04,642.24
     of this exercise, just straighten your legs out in a bent position to test the intensity
},
{
    642.24,643.48
     is enough for you.
},
{
    643.48,648.88
     However, I still want you to engage your core and have your back flat against the floor whilst you're doing
},
{
    648.88,653.88
     this exercise. If you still find this exercise too easy I want you to strengthen
},
{
    653.88,657.78
     your legs out all the way and lift them up and down in a nice and controlled
},
{
    657.78,662.16
     manner with your back flat against the floor. If you really want to do activate
},
{
    662.16,668.66
     the hip flexors in this position just point your toes down and slightly tense your calf muscles.
},
{
    668.66,671.9
     Once again guys, thanks for watching. Now if you like these type of videos, I highly
},
{
    671.9,675.64
     recommend you check out my glute exercise video. That video would definitely help you
},
{
    675.64,680.44
     improve your anterior pelvic tilt. Now if you do have tight hips, check out my hip mobility
},
{
    680.44,684.54
     video. That video would definitely help reduce the pain in your hips and also loosen the
},
{
    684.54,688.36
     hips at the same time. I also want you to join my VIP Facebook group.
},
{
    688.36,692.24
     I want to build a community there so we can help each other out. And once again
