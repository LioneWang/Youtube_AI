{
    10.16,15.6
     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist, Brad Heineck physical therapist, the most famous physical therapist on the internet
},
{
    16.28,21.2
     And our opinion of course, today Brad we're gonna talk about how to properly adjust and safely use crutches
},
{
    21.44,27.44
     This is a skill that everybody needs to have after they've broken a leg or if they had a hip surgery or knee surgery
},
{
    28.72,30.72
     Precisely and it's one of those things that
},
{
    31.2,36.28
     If you go to a doctor, they're not gonna show you how to do it. You usually have to go to a PT or
},
{
    36.56,42.2
     Go on YouTube and see what Bob and Brad have to say. By the way, the time is now right?

{
    50.78,56.3
     Because Brad and I as children were not liked and we want to turn things around. Why Bob? Why?
},
{
    56.8,58.04
     Okay
},
{
    58.04,62.56
     Crutches, so the first thing you want to do is hopefully if you need crutches
},
{
    62.56,66.0
     You get a pair of the newer ones that are aluminum and they are
},
{
    66.16,71.76
     Much more easily adjustable. Yeah as opposed to the unscrew. Right the wooden one for
},
{
    72.16,75.38
     Yeah, you have to do a more manual labor and whatnot
},
{
    75.56,81.0
     But if that's all you have you can certainly do it using the same principles. It's just a little bit harder
},
{
    81.16,85.28
     But another first thing that's the first thing then the second first thing
},
{
    86.12,88.12
     is go to the tips and
},
{
    88.8,92.16
     See what the tips look like can you zoom in on that Lonnie?
},
{
    92.8,97.16
     If you have an older pair that's been around for a while and you don't want to go out and buy a new one
},
{
    97.16,100.88
     Which is a really good idea. We're always up for that, but make sure the tips
},
{
    101.48,106.48
     Are first of all they need to be squishy. Yeah soft. Yeah if they're old
},
{
    107.32,113.76
     Especially if they've been in the sunlight they can start to dry and crack and then they slip on the floor. They get real hard
},
{
    113.76,118.06
     Yeah, and that's usually how I test it Brad. I don't know if you do with that
},
{
    118.06,121.2
     I just go like this. Yep, and I go like this on an angle
},
{
    121.7,125.5
     And I don't know if you can go down Lonnie and if it slides away
},
{
    125.5,129.56
     you don't want to use it. It'll go just like that.
},
{
    129.56,135.12
     So once you know that your tip is good and then you got your your pair and then
},
{
    135.12,138.96
     you got to look to make sure they come in usually three different, what do I say,
},
{
    138.96,143.64
     a growth size of small ones for a child and a medium one and then the tall one
},
{
    143.64,146.68
     like this pair is would probably be a medium
},
{
    146.68,148.1
     I'd have to look but
},
{
    148.1,149.8
     This will adjust for me
},
{
    149.8,155.78
     But you take someone like Bob a tall drink of water like him six and a half footer these will not adjust
},
{
    155.78,157.78
     And actually has the numbers on here
},
{
    158.34,163.68
     What's real nice about this too so this adjusts for someone from five to all the way up to five ten
},
{
    163.68,166.36
     Right so obviously I don't fit into that
},
{
    166.52,170.16
     Yeah, he's not in that genre. I'm in the giant category
},
{
    171.16,175.88
     This is a man of men. So then also if you look up here
},
{
    176.2,179.72
     There's little cushions that go up into your armpits
},
{
    180.1,186.28
     They're nice to have on there although if you use your crutch properly you really don't need those and we'll talk about that in a little bit
},
{
    187.06,193.44
     So you take your crutches and the first adjustment there's two adjustments. There is the height of
},
{
    194.96,198.98
     The armpit pad the axillary pad. Or as normal people say it height
},
{
    199.82,204.18
     What did I say? Height. He always does height. Bob. That's okay
},
{
    204.18,208.72
     And then you have to adjust the hand as well but first you do the height.
},
{
    208.72,218.48
     Okay so when you put it I like to go a slight angle out and then this should
},
{
    218.48,222.26
     not be pushing into your armpit. You should build that, at least get two
},
{
    222.26,225.06
     fingers easily in here
},
{
    229.36,229.76
     Okay, but you know what way out there you want it just out about six inches from your foot
},
{
    233.76,235.6
     Now to adjust that on these aluminum ones
},
{
    237.6,237.96
     Push the button on both sides
},
{
    243.64,246.6
     Now Bob mentioned there's numbers on here like this one says 510 which I'm 510 I keep shrinking I used to be 510 and a half
},
{
    247.06,252.42
     But when I put it on 510 it's too tall. Yeah, so it'll get you in the ballpark. It'll get you close
},
{
    252.42,258.06
     But you got to figure it out yourself. Yeah, okay. So I have it all the way up and obviously it's not gonna work for me
},
{
    258.06,263.6
     Right, so why don't you put that one to the 5.9 because I know that's good for me. Gotcha
},
{
    263.8,265.84
     This one's already pre-adjusted.
},
{
    266.12,272.54
     So Bob will do that and there we go. You know they should be the same, you know unless there's some anomalies they have.
},
{
    272.54,274.54
     But now look at this.
},
{
    274.7,278.72
     When you put your hand down here, you should have a slight bend in the elbow.
},
{
    279.18,281.98
     Now look at this one. I've got a lot of bend in this. Too much bend.
},
{
    282.86,286.26
     So when you put at that same angle and put your arm down
},
{
    286.66,290.6
     the handle should ride right about at the wrist
},
{
    291.2,294.24
     Okay, and so you have that slight bend
},
{
    295.32,297.32
     You're gonna adjust that one
},
{
    297.4,303.4
     Now they don't I think they do make these that are quick adjust Bob and you don't have to fiddle around with
},
{
    303.4,304.4
     Really?
},
{
    304.4,307.2
     I thought they'd be worried about that because it might loosen it.
},
{
    307.2,311.28
     Well you might be right, I don't know. Can I talk about this while you're doing that? Yeah you go ahead.
},
{
    311.28,316.02
     So some people, you know because you're on crutches all day long and taking weight through the hands
},
{
    316.56,319.84
     We have a lot of patients who become their hands get real sore
},
{
    320.04,331.42
     So sometimes we just take lambs wool like this and cut it up or something soft And we wrap it around like this and tape it in place and that creates a nice cushion
},
{
    331.66,337.66
     That when you're having to put weight through the hand all day long it helps make that a little bit more
},
{
    338.24,340.24
     able to handle it more comfortable
},
{
    340.88,342.88
     That's the one I was looking for
},
{
    342.66,344.54
     More comfortable. That's what I was looking for
},
{
    348.1,353.2
     All right, okay, so I got them adjusted properly They're not pushing into my armpit so the weight of your body when you take your step
},
{
    353.5,356.16
     It's going to go through your palms of your hand
},
{
    356.4,361.26
     Not into your armpits because you got some nerve bundle that goes through there and if you get that irritated
},
{
    361.7,364.6
     You're gonna have some problems and it's gonna be uncomfortable to use
},
{
    364.6,370.82
     It's gonna send pain and numbness and tingling down your arm, you might be squeezing a little bit, right?
},
{
    371.76,377.12
     Just to hold them in place, you squeeze the arms together a little bit, right so they're not flapping around
},
{
    377.64,381.44
     Okay, so you get them adjusted properly now typically when you have crutches
},
{
    381.44,384.48
     There is a no weight bearing status one of your legs
},
{
    388.06,393.76
     Typically when you have crutches there is a no weight bearing status one of your legs is not gonna be allowed to have any weight for a broken You know ankle knee whatever it may be, so obviously that's my leg that's broken
},
{
    394.72,396.36
     so
},
{
    396.36,398.68
     you're gonna lead with your crutches and
},
{
    399.56,403.22
     Swing through here, and you know you just start out easy and
},
{
    404.48,406.04
     Typically younger people
},
{
    406.04,410.96
     Get really good at this, really fast, you know if I have someone in their 70s
},
{
    411.36,418.52
     Oftentimes we won't use these unless they're pretty mobile then we'll work on this and they do work pretty darn well
},
{
    419.04,422.32
     And you can get some pretty good speed on them
},
{
    422.32,427.72
     Now the thing about crutches you can use them on stairs where it's difficult to use like a walker
},
{
    428.52,433.48
     That's a really good point Bob. That's why a lot of times they're a little more versatile
},
{
    433.48,438.32
     Of course they fall over every time you sit down and place them somewhere they're gonna fall. That's true
},
{
    438.32,439.92
     That's true
},
{
    439.92,441.32
     Now
},
{
    441.32,447.44
     Typically what'll happen let's say this leg I was using crutches as no weight bearing and four weeks later
},
{
    447.44,453.16
     The doctor says well now you can put weight on us, but it's gonna hurt you still might need some support
},
{
    453.16,459.0
     So partial weight bearing? Yeah partial weight bearing at that point a lot of times you can get rid of the one crutch
},
{
    460.16,465.0
     Now if this is one that's partial weight bearing you're gonna use the crutch in the opposite hand
},
{
    465.0,468.68
     A lot of people think it's over here and you're gonna walk with it together
},
{
    469.04,473.32
     Which you can do but over here you're much more stable
},
{
    473.32,475.32
     It's a more of a natural walk too
},
{
    475.56,477.28
     So then
},
{
    477.28,482.88
     The sore leg is gonna go forward with the crutch so these two are a mirror from each other
},
{
    482.88,485.54
     I like to think of it and then sore leg
},
{
    486.14,489.78
     Crutch they work together just like they're glued together
},
{
    490.62,496.6
     I'm out of the picture Bob. Yeah as an alternative you could I mean if you're not that fast
},
{
    496.6,498.6
     I mean you could go crutch
},
{
    498.6,500.04
     sore leg
},
{
    500.04,502.04
     One two three
},
{
    502.32,507.24
     One two three right until you get maybe a little more better with it.
},
{
    507.24,509.08
     Yeah, that's a good point Bob.
},
{
    509.08,511.64
     And you can also use both crutches to start off with partial recurrence.
},
{
    511.64,513.32
     Sure, you better believe it.
},
{
    513.32,516.24
     One two three, I mean you can go crutches.
},
{
    516.24,516.92
     Crutches.
},
{
    516.92,519.08
     One one three, yeah.
},
{
    519.08,524.2
     Crutches, sore leg, good leg. Crutches, sore leg, good leg.
},
{
    524.2,526.06
     Keep singing that to yourself.
},
{
    526.06,530.32
     Yeah, and then people will wonder again about you, what is going on.
},
{
    530.32,535.56
     We don't have a chair here Bob, I did want to show one thing, if you're sitting down
},
{
    535.56,536.56
     and you got your two crutches.
},
{
    536.56,537.56
     Oh how to get up.
},
{
    537.56,539.16
     Yeah, how to get up is a nice thing to review.
},
{
    539.16,540.8
     It's funny, I just went through this with a patient.
},
{
    540.8,541.8
     You did.
},
{
    541.8,542.8
     She didn't know how to do this.
},
{
    542.8,546.34
     Yeah, did you tell her, you could have told her to wait until she saw this video
},
{
    547.54,553.18
     So you have your crutches sitting here and here's my sore leg and I want to get up to
},
{
    553.62,557.1
     Let's say I want to get up to go get something to eat, go to the refrigerator. I
},
{
    557.98,561.14
     like to put both crutches together like this
},
{
    562.1,563.62
     And go like this
},
{
    563.62,566.84
     Yeah, and sometimes what you can do is you go to the
},
{
    566.84,572.2
     back of the chairs right here so you can turn so that now you can use your
},
{
    572.2,575.92
     arm on the back of the chair so now the back of the chairs right here right
},
{
    575.92,579.56
     what are you something if we had an actual chair yeah we got a chair right
},
{
    579.56,587.78
     here Brad anybody could do it that way Bob
},
{
    589.78,590.86
     You're not gonna be able to turn on this one
},
{
    595.2,598.04
     So I've got this here, I'm gonna turn here and I can go off of here And get it, there we go, and then go to here
},
{
    598.04,601.2
     And that's it seems like a minor thing, but it was a big thing for her
},
{
    601.2,606.06
     She was a young athlete and still she was like how do I get up with crutches?
},
{
    606.32,609.94
     I've seen people do it even like this too Brad. I mean where they
},
{
    610.34,612.34
     They go like this
},
{
    612.7,617.04
     And yeah, but that's a little more difficult, but it does work
},
{
    617.04,620.54
     Right you got two wobbly things if you can get your hand on one solid
},
{
    620.54,621.98
     It's a lot more stable to do the other way
},
{
    621.98,628.08
     One solid object and then and then these so I don't know everything is looking pretty good
},
{
    628.08,632.76
     So make sure your adjustments right you got good tips you go through the sequence
},
{
    632.76,634.76
     Avoid the ice remember on ice you're
},
{
    634.88,641.38
     I mean especially when you live in Minnesota, Wisconsin like we do yeah, and you're dealing with I mean the crunches
},
{
    641.38,648.76
     Just don't grab on ice, right. That's a whole other story We may do a video on what you can do to get the grippers for ice
},
{
    649.68,653.72
     There was such a thing so all right. Take care. Thanks for watching
},
