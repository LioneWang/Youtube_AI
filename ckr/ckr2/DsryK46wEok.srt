     Hey, welcome to another video from Skinny Medic.
},
{
    2.4,5.32
     In this video, I want to talk about the treatment for minor burns.
},
{
    5.32,8.88
     When I say minor burns, I mean minor burns, okay?
},
{
    8.88,12.64
     I'm not talking about things like blisters or charring or anything like that.
},
{
    12.64,15.64
     This is just minor burns that have some redness to the skin.
},
{
    15.64,20.28
     And we start talking about first degree burns, and these are superficial first degree burns
},
{
    20.28,22.2
     that have redness only.
},
{
    22.2,24.68
     One of the first things I think about is like a sunburn, okay?
},
{
    24.68,25.46
     You've been out on the beach,
},
{
    25.46,28.88
     been outside working, whatever, and you get sunburn.
},
{
    28.88,31.36
     That's typically a first degree sunburn.
},
{
    31.36,33.0
     You get redness all over your skin.
},
{
    33.0,34.56
     It's very painful.
},
{
    34.56,35.72
     You can get blisters of that,
},
{
    35.72,37.24
     but typically we're talking about
},
{
    37.24,40.56
     just a first degree burn here with sunburns, redness.
},
{
    40.56,44.48
     But fire obviously can cause a first degree burn.
},
{
    44.48,47.16
     You get hot water that gets spilled on you.
},
{
    47.16,48.96
     You touch something hot that's metal
},
{
    48.96,50.96
     can cause a first degree burn.
},
{
    50.96,54.12
     You've got chemicals that can cause a first degree burn.
},
{
    54.12,56.44
     Electricity can cause a first degree burn.
},
{
    56.44,58.3
     So there's a number of things that can cause
},
{
    58.3,61.04
     these first degree superficial type burns.
},
{
    61.04,62.24
     So at first degree burns,
},
{
    62.24,64.2
     you're gonna have some redness at the side.
},
{
    64.2,67.92
     You can also have some swelling. You can have some pain associated with this and
},
{
    67.92,72.0
     then once it starts to heal you're gonna get some dry peeling of that first
},
{
    72.0,76.56
     layer of the skin. Typically first three burns take about seven to ten days to heal.
},
{
    76.56,80.64
     So once we've removed the patient from the source of the burning we're gonna
},
{
    80.64,85.3
     flush whichever part of the body is burned with cool water
},
{
    85.76,87.76
     This could be an arm a leg
},
{
    88.0,93.56
     Whatever we're gonna flush it with cool water try to avoid ice. Don't use ice waters too cold
},
{
    93.56,97.22
     We just cool water for about 15 to 30 minutes
},
{
    97.88,101.74
     Personally, I avoid butter mayonnaise and stuff like that on these types of burns
},
{
    101.74,106.0
     I personally and everybody has an opinion you can do with that what you want,
},
{
    106.0,108.5
     I have found that using putting the oils,
},
{
    108.5,111.0
     like the butter and the mayonnaise on these types of burns,
},
{
    111.0,113.5
     actually makes the burning worse for the patient.
},
{
    113.5,117.0
     So after you've let it run in the water for about 20 to 30 minutes,
},
{
    117.0,120.5
     dry off the hand or whatever you need to this burn,
},
{
    120.5,122.5
     with a clean dry cloth.
},
{
    127.0,132.0
     I probably would avoid rubbing the towel real aggressively across the burn. Just kind of patting it dry.
},
{
    133.0,137.0
     If you want to put some of the aloe or some of the burn gel on there, you can if you want to.
},
{
    138.0,142.0
     But this burn is going to heal on its own. We're going to let it naturally heal. It's going to heal.
},
{
    142.0,145.12
     But sometimes the natural al alloy, the burn gels,
},
{
    145.12,147.36
     do help with some of the pain relief here.
},
{
    147.36,149.94
     These burn gels here, they have bandaging as well.
},
{
    149.94,152.6
     This is gel, of course, but then they have bandaging.
},
{
    152.6,154.4
     They contain lot of canes, it's gonna help the pain,
},
{
    154.4,156.72
     so you'll see a lot of these commercially available,
},
{
    156.72,158.64
     and they do really great for these types of burns
},
{
    158.64,159.96
     we're talking about in this video.
},
{
    159.96,162.92
     So 24 hours after the initial treatment here,
},
{
    162.92,163.76
     we're gonna wash it.
},
{
    163.76,165.84
     You can wash it gently with some soap and water.
},
{
    165.84,168.74
     If you wanna do some Betadine wash here as well,
},
{
    168.74,170.36
     you're trying to prevent infection.
},
{
    170.36,172.42
     Just make sure your patients not allergic to Betadine
},
{
    172.42,174.12
     or iodine before you do this.
},
{
    174.12,176.34
     But at the very least, I would wash it
},
{
    176.34,178.3
     with some soapy water to keep it clean.
},
{
    178.3,180.04
     You wanna try to prevent infection.
},
{
    180.04,181.44
     You can also use the Betadine.
},
{
    181.44,183.0
     I like the individual swabs.
},
{
    183.0,184.92
     That way you're not having to open up a whole bottle
},
{
    184.92,185.72
     of Betadine. You can just use the little small packets. I like the individual swabs. That way you're not having to open up a whole bottle of Betadine.
},
{
    185.72,187.2
     You can just use the little small packets here,
},
{
    187.2,189.04
     especially dealing with those minor burns
},
{
    189.04,190.72
     like if I had on my hand here.
},
{
    190.72,193.24
     Then these little small Betadine packets work well
},
{
    193.24,194.16
     and you'll have to worry about opening up
},
{
    194.16,196.08
     a big giant bottle of Betadine.
},
{
    196.08,198.64
     If it's a large enough surface area on the skin
},
{
    198.64,199.48
     and you're concerned about it,
},
{
    199.48,201.12
     you can wrap it with some five-in-nines,
},
{
    201.12,202.88
     some four-by-fours and some clean
},
{
    202.88,205.28
     to kind of keep it protective from the environment. There again, it's painful.-in-nounds, some four-by-fours, and some clean to keep it protective from the environment.
},
{
    205.28,207.04
     There again, it's painful.
},
{
    207.04,210.16
     First three burns are painful, but we just want to make sure it doesn't get infected.
},
{
    210.16,214.88
     That's one of the big things with berms is the infection posts that initial response.
},
{
    214.88,218.24
     Make sure we keep it clean, and it should heal on its own.
},
{
    218.24,222.88
     Some of the things I read about post-24 hours initial response to these berms is putting
},
{
    222.88,228.36
     some vitamin E on the berm itself. that's going to prevent scarring. The burn centers use the silver
},
{
    228.36,233.08
     dine so you can do clodal silver, silver dine dressings as well. You could have
},
{
    233.08,237.32
     hunting as a good natural antibiotic here as well so you can make it look at doing
},
{
    237.32,241.32
     something like that. So you've got quite a few options post 24 hours but we just
},
{
    241.32,244.6
     want to make sure that we keep the one clean. First three burns can be painful
},
{
    244.6,246.92
     like I've talked about before so if you want to look at
},
{
    246.92,252.56
     taking some ibuprofen some Tylenol for pain management it's probably appropriate.
},
