    0.0,9.0
     Hey everybody, it's Doctor Jo and the Pops I know and today I'm going to show you a seated relaxing full-body stretching routine in real time.
},
{
    9.0,10.5
     So let's get started.
},
{
    10.5,13.0
     Disclaimer alert, disclaimer alert.
},
{
    13.0,27.04
     So before we get started, if you haven't already, make sure you click that subscribe button and make your subscription public or let me know that you're a subscriber because I always try and respond to my subscribers. So I'm gonna go ahead and start with the warm-up and
},
{
    27.04,31.04
     kind of talk through what I'm doing while we're warming up. So the warm-up is
},
{
    31.04,35.88
     gonna be one minute. So let's just start off with some long arc quads or kicking
},
{
    35.88,41.08
     your legs out just to get those loosened up. So with each stretch, since it's
},
{
    41.08,45.92
     real time, we're gonna do 30 seconds on each side. Some of them aren't
},
{
    45.92,51.28
     an actual hold, some of them are just kind of doing it for the 30 seconds, but
},
{
    51.28,55.6
     we'll do 30 seconds quote on each side and then have a short break in between
},
{
    55.6,60.16
     each one. Now let's do a little march back and forth and then a long break in
},
{
    60.16,65.2
     between each actual set of exercises just to give our bodies a little reset
},
{
    65.2,69.4
     while we're doing it. So after you kind of get those legs warmed up a little bit,
},
{
    69.4,75.04
     you can just kind of do some arm kind of jumping jack movements going out and in
},
{
    75.04,80.36
     a little bit. Once you get that moving a little bit then you can kind of go out
},
{
    80.36,85.2
     and in just to get all of that loosened up a little bit. So after you
},
{
    85.2,88.66
     get all those now we're gonna go into the first stretch which is gonna be an
},
{
    88.66,94.32
     upper trap stretch. So I like to just kind of sit on my hand and then I'm gonna
},
{
    94.32,99.8
     pull over to the side. So I want you to see it's bringing the whole head sideways.
},
{
    99.8,104.04
     I'm not turning my chin or anything like that. I'm just going over to the side
},
{
    104.04,109.0
     and holding that full 30 seconds. You should be able to feel that upper trap right in
},
{
    109.0,113.8
     through here. That's going to be able to help kind of relax those muscles in the
},
{
    113.8,117.52
     neck there getting that stretch. You want to feel comfortable stretch? You don't
},
{
    117.52,122.36
     want it to be super painful. So now we'll have a quick little break in between.
},
{
    122.36,126.08
     We're gonna do the other side. You can also do your hand behind your back.
},
{
    126.08,128.2
     So I'm gonna do behind my back for this one
},
{
    128.2,130.56
     just so you can see different ways to stretch it.
},
{
    130.56,132.64
     So I'm just gonna place my hand behind my back.
},
{
    132.64,135.68
     But again, I'm just pulling right over to the side.
},
{
    135.68,137.72
     My finger is kind of on top of my ear
},
{
    137.72,140.52
     so I know I'm getting that just direction over
},
{
    140.52,142.56
     to the side, getting that stretch.
},
{
    142.56,144.72
     And again, you should kind of feel it in the neck area.
},
{
    144.72,148.48
     It might go all the way up to your ear area and then down into the
},
{
    148.48,153.14
     shoulder. You should feel that as well. This one sometimes might bother the
},
{
    153.14,157.04
     shoulder with it behind your back. So again you can put it either sit
},
{
    157.04,162.88
     on it or just push your arm down. So now I got a little longer break just to kind
},
{
    162.88,167.68
     of reset everything. But next we're going to go into a levator scapulae stretch and again there's two
},
{
    167.68,171.44
     different ways you can do your arm so I'll do one way on one side and one way
},
{
    171.44,175.28
     on the other but you do whatever's most comfortable for you. I'm going to start
},
{
    175.28,180.48
     just with my hand behind my back. My hand's going behind my head. My head's
},
{
    180.48,186.4
     turned at about a 45 degree angle and I'm almost trying to tuck my nose into my armpit there.
},
{
    186.4,193.12
     And so that's the stretch. I'm not turning my head sideways. I'm pulling down and again just kind of
},
{
    193.12,199.68
     tucking that nose in there and I should feel that stretch right through there because that
},
{
    199.68,210.68
     levator scapulae goes from your shoulder blade all the way up into your cervical spine into that neck. So you can also put your hand up that helps hold that shoulder
},
{
    210.68,214.36
     blade down but sometimes it's a little uncomfortable for people but this is the
},
{
    214.36,217.92
     way I learned it so I like to do it. My hand's going to be on my shoulder here
},
{
    217.92,223.44
     with my elbow up and again turning to that 45 degree kind of tucking that nose
},
{
    223.44,226.04
     into that armp pit area,
},
{
    226.04,230.92
     or almost like I'm trying to go in towards my shoulder, and getting that nice stretch through there.
},
{
    230.92,232.48
     And this one feels really, really good.
},
{
    232.48,236.92
     I like this a lot of times when you have a stress and anxiety, or you just want to relax,
},
{
    237.16,241.6
     this is a really nice one to get that stretch and get everything nice and loosened up.
},
{
    244.6,247.12
     So again, that longer break just to kind of
},
{
    247.12,251.0
     reset everything. So the next one is going to be shoulder squeezes. So this
},
{
    251.0,254.16
     one's going to be when you're not necessarily going to hold it for 30 seconds
},
{
    254.16,258.64
     but you can do it for that 30 second time. I usually like to hold it for 3 to 5
},
{
    258.64,262.16
     seconds. So I'm going to turn a little bit so you can see me but I'm just
},
{
    262.16,269.0
     squeezing those shoulder blades together. Try and keep your shoulders down so you're not squeezing up and in. You're
},
{
    269.0,273.96
     keeping them down and squeezing in. I like to use my elbows as a guidance so
},
{
    273.96,278.76
     you can see here but I'm really using those muscles to get the squeeze. I'm
},
{
    278.76,282.44
     not using my elbows to get the squeeze. I'm using my muscles to get that squeeze.
},
{
    282.44,286.0
     So a little hold for three to five seconds
},
{
    287.04,291.52
     and then relax. Again, you're not bringing your shoulders up. Try and keep them down with that
},
{
    291.52,296.32
     squeeze. Take a little break, relax it out a little bit and then go back into the squeeze. So I'll do
},
{
    296.32,302.32
     a little bit more squeeze and less talking with this one. So again, stretch three, squeeze in
},
{
    302.0,309.32
     Then stretch three. Squeeze in for that three to five seconds.
},
{
    309.32,311.48
     You can also do it without your hands.
},
{
    311.48,315.28
     If you just want to do that squeeze like this to make sure you're using those muscles you
},
{
    315.28,316.28
     can.
},
{
    316.28,319.42
     Again, kind of holding it that three to five seconds.
},
{
    319.42,323.3
     If you want to tuck in your chin a little bit while you're doing it too, you can get
},
{
    323.3,331.64
     a double stretch with that and then relax and then go back into that stretch. So we got
},
{
    331.64,336.4
     that little long break. So now we're gonna go into rotating the back a little
},
{
    336.4,340.04
     bit, getting what we would call trunk rotation and sitting. So it gets the upper
},
{
    340.04,344.12
     back, the mid back a little bit and the low back. So if you have armrests that
},
{
    344.12,349.08
     works well too, if you don't, all you're gonna do is just kind of grab and get a
},
{
    349.08,352.72
     little twist. This shouldn't be painful, you should feel that nice little stretch
},
{
    352.72,357.64
     through your spine there so you don't have to pull hard. Again this one doesn't
},
{
    357.64,362.0
     necessarily have to be a 30-second stretch, it can if you want it to be to do
},
{
    362.0,369.5
     each side. I like to hold the stretch because as you go sometimes you can get that little bit more stretch as you do it but if
},
{
    369.5,373.48
     you want to do like a 10 to 15 stretch and just alternate back and forth you
},
{
    373.48,375.84
     can do that for this one as well because this one might be a little more
},
{
    375.84,380.6
     uncomfortable. But again I like doing the full hold for this one just to get that
},
{
    380.6,386.88
     nice stretch in there and then you're just going to rotate back to the other side.
},
{
    394.16,398.64
     So again, if you've got maybe a chair that is tall so you can't grab on the edge, you can just do it with your body. You don't have to hold on to the side or to the armrest,
},
{
    398.64,402.64
     but sometimes that's nice because that gives you that little extra pull. But again, see,
},
{
    402.64,406.24
     I don't have to. I can just actually use my leg if I want to
},
{
    406.24,407.8
     and twist to that side.
},
{
    407.8,411.24
     I'm getting that nice kind of stretch through there.
},
{
    411.24,412.72
     So that's nice as well.
},
{
    416.28,418.64
     So the next one is gonna be a QL stretch
},
{
    418.64,421.2
     and that muscle, the quadratus lumborum,
},
{
    421.2,422.72
     is one of those back muscles
},
{
    422.72,429.84
     that a lot of times causes back pain, but we just don't think about it a lot and it's really a big stressor so
},
{
    429.84,434.8
     it's nice to relax it. I'm gonna place it, I'm just gonna sit on my hand and then
},
{
    434.8,439.84
     bring the other one up and what you want to do is almost sit on your hand and
},
{
    439.84,446.0
     then reach over this way and you should feel that stretch kind of through here. You might feel
},
{
    446.0,450.8
     it all the way into your lat up into the shoulder. So you're getting kind of a double stretch here,
},
{
    450.8,457.52
     but I'm lifting up and then arching over. So I'm not just pushing over, it's kind of up and then
},
{
    457.52,464.24
     I'm leaning into it getting that nice stretch. So this one again is a good one kind of for the QL,
},
{
    464.24,465.12
     the lats, the
},
{
    465.12,469.54
     shoulders and everything. But again if you have a little bit of trouble with
},
{
    469.54,473.88
     your shoulder you don't have to do the whole arm all the way up. You can kind
},
{
    473.88,477.12
     of bend over with it a little bit but you're gonna get a better stretch if you
},
{
    477.12,484.04
     come up kind of squish into that hand and then really kind of arch over to get
},
{
    484.04,485.36
     that nice stretch. I'm looking up
},
{
    485.36,489.68
     towards my hand maybe even looking into my the crease of my elbow just to get
},
{
    489.68,500.2
     that that neck and that stretch as well to get that whole body stretch. And then
},
{
    500.2,506.12
     coming back down. So the next one we're gonna kinda go into the hips and the knees a little bit.
},
{
    506.12,508.44
     So we're gonna do a seated knee to chest stretch.
},
{
    508.44,510.28
     You can also do this on the floor.
},
{
    510.28,512.84
     I just wanted to show you ways you can do it all seated
},
{
    512.84,514.28
     because sometimes people have a hard time
},
{
    514.28,515.4
     getting on the floor.
},
{
    515.4,519.44
     So this one all you're doing is just bringing your knee up
},
{
    519.44,521.68
     towards your chest just like it sounds.
},
{
    521.68,523.68
     If you do have some knee issues,
},
{
    523.68,526.4
     you can grab underneath here, but the goal is to
},
{
    526.4,531.04
     kind of bring that knee as close to your chest as you can comfortably. So if you're feeling a little
},
{
    531.04,536.32
     pinch in the front or some uncomfortableness in the back, don't force it. Just go to where you feel
},
{
    536.32,541.2
     tension and get that nice stretch in there. If you don't have any knee issues, you can kind of
},
{
    541.2,549.12
     grab in like this. I'll give you a little bit better stretch, but try not to come forward. Keep your back straight if you can so that will give
},
{
    549.12,553.16
     you a little bit better stretch. And then you're just going to go over into the
},
{
    553.16,557.44
     other side. So same thing, my left side's a little bit tighter because of my past
},
{
    557.44,562.2
     surgery, but just coming up like this, again not necessarily like this, try and
},
{
    562.2,566.0
     keep your back straight so you can really feel that stretch in here and through here.
},
{
    566.0,571.06
     But if you have those knee problems, you can kind of grab underneath if you want to as well.
},
{
    571.16,577.52
     So this is just a nice kind of modification of this knee to chest stretch if you have a hard time getting on the floor.
},
{
    577.88,581.0
     But you can do it lying down in your bed or on a couch too.
},
{
    581.8,587.18
     But if you're in a chair, this is a nice way to do it. So the
},
{
    587.18,589.74
     next one's going to be a hamstring stretch this is kind of another
},
{
    589.74,593.46
     modification if you're sitting and you can't get down on the floor or you don't
},
{
    593.46,596.98
     want to stand up or you don't have time to stand up to do the stretch. You can
},
{
    596.98,601.54
     really just kind of scoot to the edge of your chair and prop your leg out. Keep
},
{
    601.54,605.16
     your leg straight and keep your back straight and all you're doing is
},
{
    605.16,609.88
     just leaning it at your hips. So I'm not curling down trying to touch my toes. You
},
{
    609.88,613.92
     need to keep your back straight to get that stretch in those hamstrings. So you
},
{
    613.92,617.04
     should feel that stretch right through there. You might feel it more in your
},
{
    617.04,621.08
     hips. You might feel it more at your knee but it doesn't matter because that
},
{
    621.08,628.0
     hamstring is all the way up in your hip down past your knee. So that's why it's important to keep your knee straight and that's why it's
},
{
    628.0,632.5
     important to keep your back straight to really get that stretch.
},
{
    632.5,635.0
     And then you just go over and switch to the other side.
},
{
    635.0,637.2
     So I'm going to turn a little bit so you can see that.
},
{
    637.2,641.4
     If you pull up your toes, that helps lock out your knee and that helps get a little
},
{
    641.4,643.3
     bit of a calf stretch as well.
},
{
    643.3,645.28
     But again, if I'm curling down like I'm
},
{
    645.28,650.4
     not feeling much of a stretch right here at all, but if I keep my back straight, I feel a really
},
{
    650.4,656.08
     good stretch in those hamstrings. So really try and keep keep that straight and just move at your
},
{
    656.08,664.16
     hips right through there. This one's been a little bit tight because I've been doing a lot of yard
},
{
    664.16,669.64
     work and so it's nice just to kind of relieve all that and make it nice and relaxed while I'm stretching
},
{
    669.64,671.76
     it out.
},
{
    671.76,675.52
     So the last one is going to be an active calf stretch.
},
{
    675.52,679.84
     A lot of times you might see me using a strap and use a dog leash or a belt, but you can
},
{
    679.84,684.24
     also stretch it actively too if you don't have any equipment to do it.
},
{
    684.24,687.44
     So really just put your leg out in front of you, again try and keep your knee straight,
},
{
    687.44,692.44
     and just pull your toes towards you. So I feel a little bit in my quad because
},
{
    692.44,695.78
     you're activating your quad to straighten out your knee, but when you pull
},
{
    695.78,699.8
     your toes up you're gonna feel that calf stretch in there. So you don't
},
{
    699.8,704.12
     necessarily have to do it passively, sometimes that's better to get a bigger
},
{
    704.12,707.7
     stretch, but you can just pull it towards you and you should really feel that
},
{
    707.7,711.36
     stretch as well. Again I'm feeling it in my quads because I'm activating
},
{
    711.36,715.28
     everything but as I pull my toes up I'm gonna feel it in the calves and that
},
{
    715.28,719.92
     that's really kind of what you want to feel is that active calf stretch and so
},
{
    719.92,723.08
     it's nice and then even if you want to put your leg down you don't have to hold
},
{
    723.08,726.82
     it up because that'll maybe take the quad out of it a little bit but I'm pulling
},
{
    726.82,731.18
     those toes up towards me and I should feel it right in through here I might
},
{
    731.18,734.46
     feel it in the back of my knee because those calf muscles cross that knee joint
},
{
    734.46,739.82
     so wherever you feel it but you want your leg to be straight and then again you
