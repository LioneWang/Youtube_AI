     Hey everyone, it's Sarah with RegisterinRSRN.com and in this video we're going to go over how
},
{
    9.04,15.84
     to use an AED on an adult and a child eight years or older.
},
{
    15.84,19.88
     Now if you are going to be recertifying for your CPR class or you're going to be taking
},
{
    19.88,23.2
     CPR, you will be learning how to use one of these.
},
{
    23.2,28.0
     This is a sample one, it's a training device and you will definitely encounter this
},
{
    28.0,32.82
     So I wanted to make this video just to help you brush up your skills before you take your recertification
},
{
    33.04,37.46
     And you can be prepared before you go to class. So let's get started
},
{
    38.02,42.76
     What is an AED? An AED that is short for automatic
},
{
    43.8,44.94
     external
},
{
    44.94,46.52
     defibrillator.
},
{
    46.52,50.16
     And what these things are, they are great.
},
{
    50.16,54.52
     Whenever you're doing CPR, typically what happens is that the first person who finds
},
{
    54.52,59.6
     the victim, they call 911 and they go get an AED or if you have someone with you, they'll
},
{
    59.6,61.48
     go get the AED for you.
},
{
    61.48,64.48
     And while they're gone, you'll be doing CPR.
},
{
    64.48,65.86
     Now whenever the AED arrives, you'll want to're gone, you'll be doing CPR. Now, whenever the AED
},
{
    65.86,70.14
     arrives, you'll want to do some steps, which I am going to demonstrate for you
},
{
    70.14,76.86
     here in a second. And what the AED does is it analyzes the victim's rhythm. And if
},
{
    76.86,82.72
     the victim is in V-fib or pulseless V-tab, which are absolutely lethal rhythms,
},
{
    82.72,89.88
     meaning that the person is fixed and to die this thing will shock it and hopefully reset their heart and they go
},
{
    89.88,94.52
     back into Sinus rhythm and come back to life because they are dying and but
},
{
    94.52,97.84
     there's some things that you want to take in consideration whenever you're
},
{
    97.84,101.72
     using the AED which I'll go over here in a second if the victim has a hairy chest
},
{
    101.72,105.32
     what are you gonna do if you If you're they're submerged in water
},
{
    111.96,112.72
     Or their chest is wet. What do you do if they have an implanted device on their chest like a pacemaker?
},
{
    116.36,117.52
     subcube or something like that where do you place these pads and
},
{
    123.46,126.32
     Transdermal patches, what do you do if you see a nitroglycerin patch or a morphine patch or something on their skin. How do you handle that? So the AAD looks
},
{
    126.32,133.12
     like this. They do look different. This is just one type and it has the green button is your
},
{
    133.12,140.72
     on button. They are so simple to use. Like it tells you everything to do. You turn this button on
},
{
    140.72,145.32
     and then it'll tell you to connect to this with your pads which I'll show you
},
{
    145.32,149.0
     here in a second and then it'll say analyzing and then whenever it's ready
},
{
    149.0,152.8
     to shock you will hit this yellow button right here of course clear the patient
},
{
    152.8,157.8
     and everything and it just tells you everything to do and you have different
},
{
    157.8,164.24
     sets of pads now on adults and children you want to use adult pads okay this is
},
{
    164.24,165.88
     what adult pads look like,
},
{
    165.88,169.08
     and on the little pads they show you where they go,
},
{
    169.08,171.28
     so it's awesome if you're in an emergency situation,
},
{
    171.28,174.12
     and here's the little connector that goes in that port.
},
{
    174.12,175.68
     And just I wanna show you this
},
{
    175.68,177.16
     because I am gonna be making a video
},
{
    177.16,179.52
     of how to use an AD on an infant,
},
{
    179.52,181.44
     and these are pediatric pads
},
{
    181.44,184.08
     on how you use them on an infant.
},
{
    184.08,186.44
     So let me show you how to use an
},
{
    186.44,192.72
     AD on an adult or child above eight or older. Okay so you're performing CPR and
},
{
    192.72,197.2
     your second CPR person has came back with the AD. You would keep doing CPR
},
{
    197.2,201.76
     until the AD is ready to analyze because no one needs to touch the patient
},
{
    201.76,206.68
     because if it cause artifact and the AD might think the patient's in V fib and they're not in
},
{
    206.68,210.8
     shock when the patient didn't need to be shocked or whenever the patient's getting
},
{
    210.8,214.0
     ready to be shocked no one needs to be touching the patient. So you'll keep doing
},
{
    214.0,217.76
     CPR and then the second seat person will hook up with the AD while you're doing
},
{
    217.76,221.96
     CPR and if you're all by yourself of course you would stop and you would use
},
{
    221.96,225.6
     the AD. So we're gonna use the AED. The AED has arrived
},
{
    226.24,230.04
     And the very first thing you want to do is you want to make sure look at the patient's chest
},
{
    230.04,233.68
     Remember those four things I was talking about if they have a hairy chest
},
{
    234.16,240.2
     You'll if there's a razor in the kit some kids have razors try to quickly trim the hairs where the patches will go
},
{
    240.32,248.2
     They normally go here and here which I'll go over here in a second. The right upper will go on the right upper chest below the collarbone.
},
{
    248.2,252.96
     And then the other one will go right here below the left nipple at the top edge, where
},
{
    252.96,255.92
     the top edge of the pad just a few inches below the armpit.
},
{
    255.92,258.4
     And the pads will show you that.
},
{
    258.4,259.96
     So you didn't have a razor.
},
{
    259.96,266.84
     Some ADDs come with extra pads and you could just take a pad and just rip the hair off and do
},
{
    266.84,272.24
     that because you have to get that hair off if possible because if not, it might not deliver
},
{
    272.24,275.6
     the greatest shock because that hair is acting like a barrier.
},
{
    275.6,279.36
     Now if the patient was submerged in water, you would have to move the patient out of
},
{
    279.36,283.0
     the water because electricity and water do not go well together.
},
{
    283.0,284.0
     You will get electrocuted.
},
{
    284.0,287.0
     It wouldn't be good. And if there's a lot of water on the patient's chest,
},
{
    287.0,290.12
     you can dry them off with a towel or something.
},
{
    290.12,293.12
     Now, if the patient's in snow or in a small puddle,
},
{
    293.12,296.12
     it's okay, you would be fine.
},
{
    296.12,298.4
     Now, if the patient has an implanted device,
},
{
    298.4,301.2
     like a pacemaker or a defibrillator, anything like that,
},
{
    301.2,304.4
     it's usually a big lump in the chest, you can really feel it.
},
{
    304.4,308.92
     You wouldn't wanna put an AED pad over that. You want to put it away from it
},
{
    308.92,313.76
     because the implanted device could stop the transmission of the shocking to the
},
{
    313.76,316.36
     heart. It can mess it up. And also if the patient had a
},
{
    316.36,322.32
     transdermal patch like nitroglycerin or a morphine patch, any type of medication
},
{
    322.32,327.76
     patch, you want to take that off and clean just wipe it off because it could burn the skin and
},
{
    328.24,334.84
     That wouldn't be good. So you get your ad the very first thing you want to do is turn it on so turn it on
},
{
    334.84,338.36
     This is a training device only no shot will be delivered
},
{
    339.52,341.52
     And it's just telling us the shots not gonna be delivered
},
{
    342.04,344.04
     Because it's training
},
{
    344.8,345.76
     Persons chest and you would remove the clothing us the shock's not gonna be delivered because it's trainee. Remove clothing from person's chest.
},
{
    345.76,347.72
     And you would remove the clothing from the person's chest,
},
{
    347.72,349.12
     of course, because you're doing CPR,
},
{
    349.12,350.96
     so it'd probably already be removed.
},
{
    350.96,354.76
     Attach pads firmly to person's chest as shown.
},
{
    354.76,357.12
     In the back, there's usually some pads.
},
{
    359.0,361.28
     And you're gonna get your pads out.
},
{
    361.28,364.48
     And this is gonna get under the collar of them.
},
{
    364.48,366.4
     And press it down firmly.
},
{
    366.4,371.84
     Check connector and pads and then put it underneath the armpit right below the nipple line right
},
{
    371.84,379.12
     here and press firmly. Check connector and pads and then we're going to connect right here with a lot
},
{
    379.12,387.52
     flashing by this. Check connector analyzing rhythm. Everyone stand clear. Everyone would want to be clear. So, Paula clear.
},
{
    390.16,391.44
     Shock advised.
},
{
    391.44,392.96
     And charging.
},
{
    392.96,394.96
     So, make low, shout, stop.
},
{
    394.96,396.48
     Shout, stop.
},
{
    396.48,401.76
     Everyone stand clear. Push the shock button.
},
{
    402.8,406.0
     And you would say clear, and everyone's clear, and then hit shock.
},
{
    406.0,410.0
     Shock delivered. Begin five cycles of CPR.
},
{
    410.0,418.0
     And then you would get back on the chest, and you would do CPR, and this little thing has a little time of the rhythm you were supposed to go.
},
{
    418.0,424.0
     You would do five cycles, which would equal two minutes, and then this thing would reanalyze and shock if that was needed.
},
{
    424.0,429.0
     So that is how you use an AED on a child or an adult.
},
