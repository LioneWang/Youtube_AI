     At some point in our lives, most of us are going to get some form of low back pain.
},
{
    4.72,10.28
     For those of us who are actually quite lucky, that back pain will turn into just a very
},
{
    10.28,14.48
     short episode, a very acute but short passing.
},
{
    14.48,18.6
     For those of us who are not quite so lucky though, that low back pain will become very
},
{
    18.6,25.04
     chronic and chronic back pain is really anything that's longer than maybe six months or more.
},
{
    25.04,27.68
     In today's video, I'm gonna talk to you mainly
},
{
    27.68,30.0
     about low back pain that's chronic.
},
{
    30.0,31.44
     And what exercises you can do
},
{
    31.44,34.0
     that might help you to get over it.
},
{
    34.0,35.92
     One thing I've noticed over time, guys,
},
{
    35.92,39.48
     is that people with lower back pain are often very tight
},
{
    39.48,42.8
     in the areas surrounding the area of pain.
},
{
    42.8,45.92
     So in terms of lower back it's often their
},
{
    45.92,51.08
     erector spiny, the muscles going alongside the spine, their gluteal and hip
},
{
    51.08,57.08
     muscles and also their hamstrings. Now if you look at the diagram let's assume
},
{
    57.08,61.56
     someone has pain in this region, this lower back region here. Above it you've
},
{
    61.56,67.28
     got the erector spiny, below it you've got the glute minimus, medius and
},
{
    67.28,73.28
     maximus, so the gluteal muscles, the hamstrings and then lower down into the calf.
},
{
    73.28,75.56
     Those are all really strong muscle groups.
},
{
    75.56,79.76
     I think it's a bit of a chicken and egg thing going on here.
},
{
    79.76,85.84
     Were they experiencing lower back pain because they were predisposed by tight hamstrings,
},
{
    85.84,91.76
     buttocks and hips or did the lower back pain happen and then as a way of
},
{
    91.76,96.32
     protecting it the body then tightened up the hamstrings, the buttocks and hips.
},
{
    96.32,102.32
     Either way when you're treating lower back pain I think it's really important
},
{
    102.32,107.0
     to focus not only on the lower back but also the areas above and below.
},
{
    107.0,125.78
     So I'm going to show you now a few simple exercises for your hips, buttocks and hamstrings that you can do to start getting more flexible and looser in those areas to hopefully start freeing up your lower back. The first thing that you're gonna do is to hang
},
{
    125.78,129.92
     off of a door frame or a bar at the gym.
},
{
    129.92,134.72
     Hanging from a bar or a door frame is safe for
},
{
    134.72,137.16
     pretty much all types of back pain.
},
{
    137.16,141.04
     So this is why I suggest you start with this one first.
},
{
    141.04,144.84
     The reason why you're gonna hang is because
},
{
    144.84,148.08
     in your spine the
},
{
    148.08,154.16
     hanging is going to create a pulling sensation on the indivertible discs. So
},
{
    154.16,161.04
     if you have a disc bulge or a disc prolapse then that pulling is going to
},
{
    161.04,166.68
     almost create a suction type mechanism which could potentially pull
},
{
    166.68,173.76
     some of that disc prolapse or disc bulge back in and thus reducing the extent of the disc
},
{
    173.76,187.48
     prolapse. So reach up, grab a butt, drop your knees down and just allow your lower back and abdominal region to relax and from this position just
},
{
    187.48,197.6
     continue to breathe but allowing your pelvis to drop.
},
{
    197.6,203.68
     Another really simple but effective stretch and mobilization is what they call in yoga
},
{
    203.68,205.74
     the cat and cow.
},
{
    208.68,209.18
     You're going to start by coming down onto your hands and knees.
},
{
    213.34,216.14
     Place your hands underneath your shoulders and your knees underneath your hips. So you're in an all fours position.
},
{
    216.14,222.14
     Make sure your spine is neutral, so it's neither overly flexed or overly extended.
},
{
    223.18,226.52
     Once you're comfortable in that position, take a deep breath in and
},
{
    226.52,232.68
     as you breathe in, look up towards the ceiling and push your belly down so your lower back
},
{
    232.68,239.32
     is bending. Once you've taken another deep breath in, breathe out and as you breathe
},
{
    239.32,245.76
     out drop your head down, lift your lower spine as much as you can, almost like someone's got a
},
{
    245.76,250.4
     piece of string on your back and is lifting it up. Once you've fully
},
{
    250.4,255.28
     exhaled, take another deep breath in and as you do that lift your head up again,
},
{
    255.28,261.6
     pushing your belly down. The reason I think this is a good exercise to do is
},
{
    261.6,265.28
     because it causes movement throughout the lower back which
},
{
    265.28,270.24
     makes the muscles of your lower back the erector spiny contract and relax which
},
{
    270.24,276.18
     helps to push blood through the muscles and allows better drainage of the blood
},
{
    276.18,281.48
     and any inflammation that helps to push it away. I suggest doing this about five
},
{
    281.48,285.88
     to ten times really slowly and just focusing on the
},
{
    285.88,289.92
     speed of your breath rather than trying to get through the movement. The next
},
{
    289.92,296.16
     really important stretch is for your hips and buttocks. You can do this while
},
{
    296.16,301.84
     you're at the office or at home or anywhere that's seated. You can also do
},
{
    301.84,305.6
     another variation which is lying down on the floor which I'll show you afterwards.
},
{
    306.72,311.6
     So if you're at work and you're sat down on the chair and perched the edge of your chair,
},
{
    312.48,321.04
     put one leg on top of the other knee, hold your shin with both hands and then use your elbow
},
{
    322.0,324.0
     to push that knee down.
},
{
    324.42,328.12
     and then use your elbow to push that knee down.
},
{
    330.24,332.54
     If you wanna increase that stretch, you can lean forwards into it.
},
{
    332.54,335.56
     But most people will find that this is enough
},
{
    335.56,339.68
     just by putting a hand or an elbow on that top knee
},
{
    340.68,341.6
     and pushing down.
},
{
    341.6,346.24
     One thing I would just point out to you guys is don't put your
},
{
    346.24,351.12
     foot on your knee because that's going to put a lot of stress through your ankle
},
{
    351.12,355.6
     which will make your ankle ligaments start to become overstretched. So make
},
{
    355.6,367.56
     sure that ankle is well over your planted knee. From here grab your knee, lift your knee up and over so that now you should be
},
{
    367.56,373.44
     feeling a stretch through your buttocks. When I do these stretches on myself, I like to
},
{
    373.44,380.4
     do each stretch for about 20 seconds, alternate into the other one, about 20 seconds, alternate
},
{
    380.4,387.64
     back and keep repeating every other 20 seconds. I find that this helps to keep it a bit looser,
},
{
    387.64,390.56
     almost like it's pumping blood through the area
},
{
    390.56,393.72
     and almost a bit like exercising it
},
{
    393.72,396.08
     rather than just purely stretching it.
},
{
    396.08,397.8
     If you're a bit more nimble
},
{
    397.8,400.4
     or you're at the gym or you're at home,
},
{
    400.4,402.76
     I find this one actually is a lot stronger.
},
{
    403.8,404.92
     Cross your legs,
},
{
    402.74,403.8
     I find this one actually is a lot stronger.
},
{
    408.8,412.58
     Cross your legs, then with whichever one you want, put on top of your bottom leg,
},
{
    413.64,417.26
     and then either using your hand or your elbow,
},
{
    418.28,421.6
     push that knee down and hold.
},
{
    424.12,429.92
     After about 20 seconds, grab your knee and put your knee up and over
},
{
    429.92,437.58
     the other way. Now some people find this stretch is too hard to get into so one
},
{
    437.58,448.4
     way of working around it is to put one leg straight, cross your other leg over and then do the same thing.
},
{
    454.88,459.88
     When it comes to stretching your hamstrings, quite often you'll see
},
{
    459.88,466.7
     runners in particular doing it wrong and what people tend to do is have their legs
},
{
    466.7,473.26
     straight and then flexion through their spine so they're trying to bend their
},
{
    473.26,479.66
     whole bodies which puts a lot of strain through the nerves at the back of the
},
{
    479.66,487.52
     at the back of the legs but also puts a lot of strain through the lower back as well.
},
{
    487.52,495.2
     So in my opinion, the best way of stretching your hamstrings is to have a soft bend in
},
{
    495.2,505.46
     the knees. Now if you're really tight to begin with, then have one leg bent. From here,
},
{
    506.58,507.54
     bend the other leg,
},
{
    509.2,511.28
     keep your chest up, and your back straight.
},
{
    511.28,513.32
     Now when you come to bend forwards,
},
{
    513.32,515.8
     you're gonna try and push your belly forward
},
{
    515.8,516.98
     onto your thigh,
},
{
    518.6,519.52
     like this.
},
{
    522.2,523.78
     That's it for today, guys.
},
{
    523.78,528.28
     I hope that today's video has helped you at least get a little bit more of an understanding
},
{
    528.28,531.92
     of what you can do for your lower back.
},
{
    531.92,538.52
     What I would suggest is the more you put into it, the more consistently you do your exercises,
},
{
    538.52,541.2
     the better results you're going to get from it.
},
{
    541.2,545.68
     If you're only doing these exercises once a week or less, you're not really going
},
{
    545.68,552.04
     to see any changes at all. My suggestion would be that you did these exercises maybe every
},
{
    552.04,560.04
     other day at least, but preferably every day. You don't have to do these exercises for 10,
},
{
    560.04,565.9
     15, 20 minutes a day. You could perhaps just choose one exercise and do that
},
{
    565.9,572.78
     stretch for one to two minutes and then the following day you could do one of the
},
{
    572.78,578.38
     other stretches and do that for one or two minutes and so on. And that way you're
},
{
    578.38,585.48
     going to consistently get something going on every day, which will eventually lead to your lower back
},
{
    585.48,591.28
     starting to respond and hopefully loosening up and becoming more and more
},
{
    591.28,596.0
     pain-free as you go. But of course I would suggest that if you do have
},
{
    596.0,600.8
     persistent low back pain go and get it checked out by someone who knows what
},
{
    600.8,610.92
     they're doing, someone who knows what to look out for and who can advise you much better than a Google search. I hope you found today's video helpful. If
},
{
    610.92,616.28
     you have, do give it a thumbs up, consider subscribing and until the next
},
{
    616.28,620.44
     one, take care and goodbye.
