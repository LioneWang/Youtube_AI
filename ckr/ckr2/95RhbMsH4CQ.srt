     Hi guys, I'm Dr. Tara Tobias and as promised welcome back to my channel in this video tutorial
},
{
    6.36,12.16
     Which is a continuation of the last two videos that I have shown the first video was
},
{
    12.72,14.72
     helping everyone understand the difference between
},
{
    15.8,17.8
     spasticity and foot drop and
},
{
    18.56,22.16
     understanding that you might have spasticity when
},
{
    22.56,25.8
     Previously you might have thought or been searching or
},
{
    25.8,28.96
     looking up information on foot drop.
},
{
    28.96,34.68
     So hopefully the people that are watching this video or have come back today to see this
},
{
    34.68,47.84
     third video are those of you who watch the first two videos and think that you fall into the group of stroke survivors that has high tone or spasticity
},
{
    47.84,54.96
     in your lower leg and this is affecting your walking and your balance. The second video
},
{
    54.96,60.8
     went a little bit more in depth about just understanding spasticity. So if you're just
},
{
    60.8,66.58
     now joining us, I highly recommend that you go back and you watch those first two videos and now as
},
{
    67.24,69.54
     Promised and this is the part that I know
},
{
    70.24,75.9
     Everyone is looking forward to because this is the question I get what exercises do I do for spasticity?
},
{
    76.0,80.96
     so as I mentioned just to review in the previous video the most
},
{
    81.44,88.88
     Important thing that you can be doing and it's probably to be everyone's least favorite thing to do, is stand.
},
{
    88.88,94.04
     And so now what we're going to do is I'm going to go through a progression
},
{
    94.04,100.88
     of activities to slowly load or add more and more weight
},
{
    100.88,106.8
     to your involved or your affected lower extremity in a manner that
},
{
    106.8,115.48
     hopefully will minimize the spasticity or the involuntary contraction of your
},
{
    115.48,122.16
     gastrocnemius, your soleus, and your posterior tibialis, which are the muscles
},
{
    122.16,125.0
     that point the foot down and invert the foot.
},
{
    125.0,132.4
     As many of you are already aware, this makes your knee pop back, it makes your toes hurt
},
{
    132.4,136.92
     sometimes when you're standing on that leg, and it makes you roll to the outside of your
},
{
    136.92,137.92
     foot.
},
{
    137.92,142.24
     Before we get into the progression, there's a couple more things that I want to explain
},
{
    142.24,146.88
     about spastic patterns. What I'm describing when I talk about
},
{
    146.88,153.84
     the muscles that point the foot down and invert the foot and extend the knee, that is what we call
},
{
    153.84,159.2
     an extensor pattern. The good news is there's two patterns. There's an extensor pattern and there's
},
{
    159.2,171.4
     a flexor pattern. If you think back, if any of you have kids or if you've watched babies kind of go from infancy to toddler, they move in patterns. So they either extend or they flex.
},
{
    171.4,176.8
     They extend or they flex and that's kind of how they get around. Well, after a brain injury,
},
{
    176.8,183.2
     you kind of go back to some of those patterns. So your leg is going to either extend or it's
},
{
    183.2,189.0
     going to flex. The good news is you can use some of those patterns to your benefit.
},
{
    189.0,197.0
     So initially you use that extensor pattern because it probably allowed you to stand up on that leg and not have that leg give out on you.
},
{
    197.0,200.0
     We can also use the flexor pattern.
},
{
    200.0,206.02
     So the flexor pattern is when your knee flexes, your foot also dorsiflexes.
},
{
    206.02,210.48
     So we're trying to get out of the extensors pattern
},
{
    210.48,211.96
     in this first phase.
},
{
    211.96,213.3
     Just follow me here.
},
{
    213.3,215.74
     We're trying to get out of that extensor pattern
},
{
    215.74,218.4
     where everything locks out straight
},
{
    218.4,221.96
     and use a little bit of that flexor pattern
},
{
    221.96,224.04
     to dorsiflex the foot.
},
{
    224.04,225.28
     The reason I explain all that is
},
{
    225.28,227.6
     because that's gonna help you understand
},
{
    227.6,230.64
     the progression of activities that we're gonna go through.
},
{
    230.64,234.52
     So just to reiterate that or re-explain that
},
{
    234.52,238.68
     is that your leg is going into an extensor pattern
},
{
    238.68,240.28
     when you stand on that leg.
},
{
    240.28,242.16
     And once it's in that extensor pattern,
},
{
    242.16,244.4
     it stays in that extensor pattern.
},
{
    244.4,250.32
     So then when you go to try and bring the leg through, the foot's pointed, the knees extended,
},
{
    250.32,254.36
     and your foot feels like it's stuck to the ground.
},
{
    254.36,262.16
     So in this first phase of a standing progression, we are going to start loading the leg in a
},
{
    262.16,268.16
     flexor pattern. And what that's going to do is it's going to
},
{
    268.16,276.52
     inhibit or prevent some of those extensor components. So step one is we're
},
{
    276.52,280.28
     going to get as flexed as possible. We're going to flex the knee up as much as
},
{
    280.28,286.44
     possible, flex the hip up as much as possible, and the ground is gonna help to dorsiflex the foot.
},
{
    286.44,288.8
     And so as you can see in this one,
},
{
    288.8,291.52
     I'm getting down onto a low stool.
},
{
    291.52,294.16
     If you don't feel safe or don't feel like
},
{
    294.16,296.62
     you can get back up from this position,
},
{
    296.62,299.94
     definitely have someone around just in case.
},
{
    299.94,303.08
     But if you can get into a low position,
},
{
    303.08,304.16
     these stools are great.
},
{
    304.16,307.08
     I highly recommend them just to have around the house. They're also helpful if you can get into a low position, these stools are great. I highly recommend them just to have around the house.
},
{
    307.08,310.66
     They're also helpful if you're sitting, you're trying to put your AFO on.
},
{
    310.66,315.44
     You can bring your foot up onto the stool and put your AFO on.
},
{
    315.44,318.1
     So they're helpful for a lot of reasons.
},
{
    318.1,321.48
     And again, when you put your foot up onto that stool, remember, you're now in a flexor
},
{
    321.48,329.66
     pattern so your foot is more likely to dorsiflex because your knee is flexed and your hip is flexed. So right now we're
},
{
    329.66,333.52
     going to use it by lowering ourselves down. You're going to sit on that stool
},
{
    333.52,338.96
     and you're just going to sit. As you can see the hip is flexed, the knee is flexed
},
{
    338.96,343.52
     and the foot is dorsiflexed. So this is giving you weight bearing on that foot.
},
{
    343.52,345.2
     So you're loading that foot, you're
},
{
    345.2,351.84
     introducing the ground to that foot, but you're really locked in a flexed pattern. So if this was
},
{
    351.84,356.56
     traumatic or stressful to your leg or your leg felt like it wanted to work, it really can't.
},
{
    356.56,361.44
     Between your body weight and the ground, it's really going to keep that ankle dorsiflexed.
},
{
    361.44,367.2
     It's also a great first step to start stretching that ankle out. So if your foot's pointed
},
{
    367.2,371.76
     and you're in therapy right now and they're trying to get your ankle dorsiflexed and it just won't go,
},
{
    372.4,376.8
     this is going to stretch. This is a great way to stretch that ankle out. So in this position
},
{
    376.8,382.4
     where you're down on the stool, you can also do a little twist. I added that. This is going to get
},
{
    382.4,387.12
     into way down the road. I'm always thinking ahead when I'm designing someone's plan.
},
{
    387.12,388.52
     So even if they're not walking,
},
{
    388.52,390.24
     I'm always thinking about the movements
},
{
    390.24,391.76
     that are gonna be required for walking,
},
{
    391.76,393.44
     and I try and incorporate them.
},
{
    393.44,395.28
     So when you add that little twist,
},
{
    395.28,398.12
     you're starting that reciprocal motion.
},
{
    398.12,399.96
     Okay, so even though it's at the very beginning,
},
{
    399.96,401.84
     you're starting to work that reciprocal motion
},
{
    401.84,403.0
     by doing that little twist.
},
{
    403.0,408.36
     So once you have done this, and again, don't rush it.
},
{
    408.36,411.08
     I mean, you cannot do this exercise enough.
},
{
    411.08,415.06
     You're getting a great stretch and you're getting out of that extensor pattern.
},
{
    415.06,419.28
     So I'm also going to show you right here a way that you can do it on stairs.
},
{
    419.28,424.12
     It's really safe because you can kind of start on a high step and scoot your way down into
},
{
    424.12,428.64
     a lower step. So if you have stairs, if you live up north, stairs aren't that common in Florida,
},
{
    428.64,431.4
     but if you live up north and you have a staircase, it's great.
},
{
    431.4,434.32
     Just go over, sit down on about the third step up,
},
{
    434.32,439.64
     and then slowly work yourself down to the first step with your feet on the ground like I'm showing in this picture.
},
{
    439.64,442.72
     So just a modification you can make. If you have a staircase,
},
{
    442.72,446.28
     it just saves you having to pull out a chair and a stool.
},
{
    446.28,452.84
     So then the next progression is to go back up to a regular height surface and now bring
},
{
    452.84,456.12
     your foot up onto the step.
},
{
    456.12,458.96
     Now you'll just have to trust me on this, but now we're starting to work more of that
},
{
    458.96,459.96
     reciprocal pattern.
},
{
    459.96,464.88
     So you have one leg, your uninvolved leg that's a little bit more extended.
},
{
    464.88,466.44
     So I always like to just add this in
},
{
    466.44,467.96
     because now we're working that component
},
{
    467.96,470.6
     because your legs aren't both flexed at the same time
},
{
    470.6,473.56
     and they're not both extended at the same time when you walk.
},
{
    473.56,478.36
     So again, you're extending the uninvolved leg a little bit
},
{
    478.36,481.0
     and you're keeping that left leg flexed
},
{
    481.0,482.32
     because it's up on the stool,
},
{
    482.32,491.12
     the hip and the knee are still staying really flexed up and this should also help to give you that dorsiflexion in the ankle
},
{
    491.12,496.44
     because again you can see that's that flexor pattern. So you could stay on
},
{
    496.44,503.4
     these two activities for days. If every time you go to stand up it goes right
},
{
    503.4,505.0
     back into that extensor pattern
},
{
    505.0,509.6
     then I would go back to this because the next progression we're going to do is a
},
{
    509.6,516.2
     little mini sit to stand so I'm not going to extend my knees or my hips all
},
{
    516.2,521.84
     the way because I don't want to go into that extensor pattern so I'm going to
},
{
    521.84,526.48
     stay really flexed. I have the involved leg on this wedge
},
{
    527.04,533.92
     and that's helpful if your foot is severely inverted. This will help to prevent that inversion.
},
{
    534.56,541.04
     So putting a little wedge underneath the outside of that foot will help when you do this next one
},
{
    541.04,545.58
     and then all you're going to do is you're just going to lean forward. So
},
{
    545.58,549.6
     both feet on the ground, if you do wedge underneath one foot, put a wedge under
},
{
    549.6,554.28
     that one foot, but you're just leaning forward. And by doing that, you are
},
{
    554.28,558.92
     loading the legs. You are just weight-bearing on those legs, introducing
},
{
    558.92,566.58
     more weight onto the bottoms of those feet without extending or allowing the legs to go into that extensor pattern.
},
{
    567.8,570.5
     And then I just add this one.
},
{
    570.5,572.68
     I've found patients love this
},
{
    572.68,575.78
     because they can do it while they're watching television.
},
{
    575.78,580.62
     But a great position to just sit in is with your legs crossed.
},
{
    580.62,583.52
     So with the involved leg on the bottom
},
{
    583.52,588.64
     and the uninvolved leg on top, you can introduce
},
{
    588.64,593.76
     more weight to this leg and then adding that forward lean again just adds a little bit
},
{
    593.76,599.92
     more weight but you're still in kind of a flexor pattern. So you're not allowing the
},
{
    599.92,606.08
     ankle to planar flex and by keeping the flex, that's going to further help keep the
},
{
    606.08,612.46
     ankle dorsiflex. So you can see these are all very static positions. They're very passive.
},
{
    612.46,618.96
     We haven't introduced any extension at all, no active extension to this point. And that
},
{
    618.96,627.68
     was done for a reason is you want to introduce weight without extending that leg because as most of you know as soon
},
{
    627.68,630.16
     as you go to extend there's no stop in it.
},
{
    630.16,632.04
     It just goes all extension.
},
{
    632.04,635.32
     Knee locks out and the foot planar flexes.
},
{
    635.32,642.72
     So everything I've shown you so far is very static in keeping that leg flexed, keeping
},
{
    642.72,649.16
     the hip flexed, the knee flexed and the ankle dorsilexed. Now we're going to introduce a little bit of extension. So
},
{
    649.16,654.28
     you're going to do a little mini sit to stand. I recommend putting the stool off
},
{
    654.28,660.28
     to your involved side. What that's going to do is it's going to help you to just
},
{
    660.28,667.24
     introduce a little weight to that leg before you actually stand, almost kind
},
{
    667.24,672.0
     of preparing the leg so you're loading it a little bit, getting the leg used to
},
{
    672.0,677.08
     having weight underneath it, and then you're just gonna do a little mini stand.
},
{
    677.08,683.2
     You're not gonna stand all the way up. If you if you lift your bottom up five
},
{
    683.2,686.68
     inches you're doing good good and that is because remember
},
{
    686.68,692.46
     We do not want to go into that extensor pattern. So we're starting to work a little more active extension
},
{
    693.52,701.8
     But we're stopping way short of full extension just introducing that little mini sit to stand and guess what I
},
{
    702.6,705.68
     Hope I'm not gonna frustrate any of you by saying this, but
},
{
    705.68,711.4
     this is where I'm going to stop the video. I know I said in the last video, stand, stand,
},
{
    711.4,715.84
     stand, but I wanted to introduce this. I'm not going to come back with the standing
},
{
    715.84,726.88
     stuff for a couple of days. I challenge all of you if you have any tone, if you need a brace on your ankle to control your ankle at all,
},
{
    727.52,733.44
     because there's involuntary movement, I highly recommend that you do these exercises for two
},
{
    733.44,739.84
     days before I show the standing exercises. We will get to standing, I promise. So I hope I
},
{
    739.84,752.24
     didn't frustrate any of you. I hope it all makes sense. If there's any piece of this that doesn't make sense, please comment below. The comments on the last video were awesome. They helped me understand
},
{
    752.24,757.6
     where everyone is at. Those of you that feel like I understand what you're going through
},
{
    758.64,762.96
     leads me to believe that you probably do have a lot of spasticity in your foot. So
},
{
    762.96,765.84
     definitely keep the comments coming.
},
{
    765.84,767.44
     Keep the likes coming.
},
{
    767.44,772.2
     If you don't like how I'm breaking this up and doing this progression, let me know.
},
{
    772.2,773.2
     Just leave a comment.
},
{
    773.2,774.96
     We're all friends.
},
{
    774.96,776.76
     It helps me to plan.
},
{
    776.76,779.6
     I want these videos to be helpful to you.
},
{
    779.6,785.76
     I am open to any comments or criticisms that you may have or any ideas that you may have on
},
{
    785.76,788.52
     how I could structure these videos differently.
},
{
    788.52,791.56
     So definitely leave those comments below.
},
{
    791.56,793.1
     Enjoy this activity.
},
{
    793.1,794.6
     Have fun with it.
