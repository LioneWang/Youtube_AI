{
    24.0,31.72
     I'm living my dream.

    31.72,38.44
     I recently had an ACL injury, probably the most devastating injury I've had and you know
},
{
    38.44,39.44
     the most difficult.
},
{
    39.44,47.0
     And having that injury kind of broke me down and it made me have to start at zero again.

{
    47.0,52.0
     Females are eight times more likely to sustain an ACL injury compared to males.

{
    55.0,61.0
     We're going to demonstrate today seven exercises that you can perform to stay on the field.

    72.6,77.84
     Knees do not come forward, hips drop back, head stays up, drive up through the heels.
},
{
    77.84,86.2
     And the first movement was not to bend at the knees, but actually drop the hips back, head and shoulders come forward and she drives back up through the heels.

    90.2,96.1
     Exercise number two, jump squat. Knees, hip, foot stays aligned. She's going to generate upper body power.
