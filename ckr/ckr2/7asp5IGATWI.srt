     Proper therapy exercises are important for recovery from most orthopedic conditions. I've designed this series
},
{
    29.0,33.0
     to provide you with up-to-date therapy regimens that you can access at home, in
},
{
    33.0,37.94
     the gym, or on the road. I hope you find these videos helpful and best of luck in
},
{
    37.94,40.36
     your recovery.
},
{

     It's important to start off with light stretching. Here we're stretching up overhead doing what's called a wall slide.
},
{
    55.36,60.72
     Use your non-operative arm to raise the operative arm, stabilizing it against the wall, or let
},
{
    60.72,66.12
     your fingers walk up the wall until you feel a gentle stretch. As your
},
{
    66.12,70.84
     motion improves you can kneel into the wall to get those last little bits of
},
{
    70.84,76.32
     motion up overhead. Stretching can also be done at this point if it's more
},
{
    76.32,87.8
     comfortable using table slides. Lean into the stretch. hold it for approximately 20 to 30 seconds relax and
},
{
    87.8,90.16
     repeat.
},
{
    102.2,110.5
     This can also be done stretching out to the side with your elbow facing the table and
},
{
    110.5,129.96
     your shoulder facing that way, leaning over to the side, let your arms stretch out. A post or a wall or a doorway is used to do rotation stretches.
},
{
    129.96,132.68
     The hand is fixed up against the wall.
},
{
    132.68,156.26
     The elbow is fixed part of the shoulder.
},
{
    156.26,158.72
     Early strengthening are done with resistance bands.
},
{
    158.72,165.1
     These come in multiple colors which give different resistance strengths. You can buy a set of these
},
{
    165.1,172.3
     easily at a sporting goods store or online. Start with the lightest band and
},
{
    172.3,177.46
     progress over approximately one to two week interval. Resistance can also be
},
{
    177.46,188.72
     altered by increasing or decreasing the stretch in the band, stepping closer or further away from its point of fixation.
},
{
    191.28,193.6
     Gentle strengthening has started with therabands.
},
{
    196.88,207.8
     Fix the theraband under your foot and lift up in front of your body and then 45 degrees out to the side, alternating these movements.
},
{
    207.8,212.8
     Tension in the band can be adjusted by length of the band.
},
{
    212.8,218.08
     Lift your arms smoothly and evenly, controlled manner up to but not above shoulder level,
},
{
    218.08,231.68
     and hold that position for a two count. Keep your elbow against your side.
},
{
    231.68,247.0
     Rotate from your stomach out to the side to strengthen an external rotation. Hold the final position for one or two counts.
},
{
    254.28,259.88
     To strengthen the back part of the shoulder, start with your arm out fully extended and
},
{
    259.88,264.96
     then bring your elbow back just to the side of your body.
},
{
    264.96,266.48
     Slow and controlled. Hold the

{
    266.48,271.64

},
{

    278.4,283.88
     Raise your shoulder blades on both sides. Hold in the fully elevated position for

{
    283.88,287.0
     a one-to to two count.

{
    307.0,308.0
     bringing your elbows back, pinching the shoulder blades and holding for a two to three count.

{
    323.0,326.0
     With your hands stabilized on the table, rotate your torso forward. try and feel your shoulder blade rotating
