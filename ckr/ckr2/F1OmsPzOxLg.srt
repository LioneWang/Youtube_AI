     If you were faced with someone who was badly burned, would you know what to do?
},
{
    6.0,8.0
     That looks good.
},
{
    8.0,16.0
     As a doctor working in emergency medicine, I want to share some simple techniques that could help you save a life.
},
{
    17.0,28.0
     Burns and scalds are very common, incredibly painful, and if severe, can be fatal. The heat that causes burns comes in many forms.
},
{
    28.0,34.0
     From scalding steam to open flames to hot, boiling oil.
},
{
    34.0,37.0
     But the good news is that for first aid,
},
{
    37.0,41.0
     the treatment for most burns and spools is essentially the same.
},
{
    43.0,49.24
     So I've come to the commercial kitchens of a hotel in Dundee to show the staff and you
},
{
    49.24,51.2
     what to do.
},
{
    51.2,53.44
     First we need a volunteer.
},
{
    53.44,58.44
     Can I get you to go over to my mate over there, Alistair, and he's going to give you a pretend
},
{
    58.44,59.44
     burn.
},
{
    59.44,66.0
     It won't hurt, I promise.
},
{
    68.0,70.0
     Who's Tad Burns? Everybody who watches my kitchen's on a boner.
},
{
    70.0,72.0
     A bit of a badge of honour.
},
{
    72.0,75.0
     We're laughing and joking about them, but for me as an A&E doctor
},
{
    75.0,78.0
     it's actually one of the most squeamish things I have to deal with
},
{
    78.0,82.0
     and it's because you just know how painful they are
},
{
    82.0,87.0
     but they also can be quite dangerous if you don't treat them properly.
},
{
    87.0,89.0
     Alistair, how are you doing?
},
{
    89.0,90.0
     I think we're ready.
},
{
    90.0,91.0
     Yeah, cool. Okay, brilliant.
},
{
    91.0,97.0
     The first thing to do is get the person to a safe place and then remove any jewellery,
},
{
    97.0,102.0
     watch or clothing from the affected area, unless it's sticking to the skin.
},
{
    102.0,106.2
     The next thing that we need to do is to run this under a tap.
},
{
    106.2,108.4
     Cold water coming down.
},
{
    108.4,113.32
     Cooling the burn will reduce pain, swelling and the risk of scarring.
},
{
    113.32,117.96
     So the faster and longer a burn is called, the better.
},
{
    117.96,121.88
     Keep it going for at least ten minutes.
},
{
    121.88,127.0
     You don't want to use ice on there because the ice could cause further damage, it could
},
{
    127.0,129.76
     cause an ice burn, it would be much more painful.
},
{
    129.76,134.76
     There are plenty of myths surrounding what you should use to treat a burn. Things like
},
{
    134.76,142.48
     yogurt, butter, oil and cream will do nothing for a burn and toothpaste is abrasive and will
},
{
    142.48,146.24
     only make matters worse.
},
{
    151.2,151.28
     So that's your arm, having been run under a tap for about 20 minutes.
},
{
    152.68,154.0
     So I'm just going to turn it off.
},
{
    156.0,156.08
     Once the skin's cooled though,
},
{
    160.0,160.08
     there is one thing you could reach for in the kitchen to help you.
},
{
    161.08,162.0
     Kling film.
},
{
    164.84,164.92
     And I would just lay it over the top like that.
},
{
    168.0,173.76
     All right, nice and loose. I'm not going to wrap it around like a sausage, so it's just literally just laying it on top. Cling film is
},
{
    173.76,180.88
     ideal as it will keep the injury clean and stop it drying out. If the size of the burn is smaller
},
{
    180.88,185.72
     than the palm of the hand of the patient and it's quite superficial,
},
{
    185.72,190.0
     some redness on the skin, then that's something you can treat at home with
},
{
    190.0,194.42
     first aid. If it's bigger than the palm of the hand you need to take him to
},
{
    194.42,201.2
     hospital. If you come across a severe burn just remember stay calm and move the
},
{
    201.2,205.66
     person to a place that's safe. Call the burn as quickly as possible
},
{
    205.66,211.68
     with cold water for at least 10 minutes and then loosely cover the burn with cling film
},
{
    211.68,218.12
     or a clean plastic bag. But if you have any doubts whatsoever just call 999.
},
