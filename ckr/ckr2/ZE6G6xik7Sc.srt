     Hi, I'm Mark Albano.
},
{
    6.1,10.82
     I'm a physical therapist here at the outpatient physical therapy clinic at Sharp Grossmont
},
{
    10.82,11.82
     Hospital.
},
{
    11.82,16.96
     Today, we're going to talk about shoulder pain, and we're going to discuss some exercises
},
{
    16.96,21.68
     that could help decrease that pain, as well as increase your range of motion.
},
{
    21.68,29.44
     First, it's important to note that there are several different causes of shoulder pain and each body is different. It's always best
},
{
    29.44,34.16
     to first consult your physical therapist or your doctor to determine which
},
{
    34.16,38.4
     exercises are specifically most appropriate for you. Oftentimes when
},
{
    38.4,42.76
     people have shoulder pain they try to avoid using it. That might even have
},
{
    42.76,47.46
     their shoulder closely intensely guarded against their body.
},
{
    47.46,49.28
     One of the most important steps
},
{
    49.28,51.24
     in decreasing your shoulder pain
},
{
    51.24,53.52
     is getting that shoulder to relax.
},
{
    53.52,54.64
     Now there are different ways
},
{
    54.64,56.76
     that you can do a pendulum exercise.
},
{
    56.76,58.6
     I'm gonna show you a way that focuses
},
{
    58.6,61.16
     on relaxing that shoulder.
},
{
    61.16,63.92
     First, come up to a table at a comfortable height.
},
{
    63.92,69.64
     Place the good shoulder down on the table and let the hurting shoulder relax down.
},
{
    69.64,73.36
     Try to make sure that the hurting shoulder is relaxed completely.
},
{
    73.36,77.24
     Then move your body weight forward and back.
},
{
    77.24,82.2
     If this hurting shoulder is relaxed completely, then that shoulder should sway with it forward
},
{
    82.2,83.8
     and back.
},
{
    83.8,89.0
     I recommend trying this exercise for three sets of 15 seconds at least once per day.
},
{
    89.0,93.0
     One of the main functions of the shoulder is to reach up in front of you.
},
{
    93.0,99.0
     If this motion is painful, then an exercise that could help with that are called table slides.
},
{
    99.0,106.3
     What you do is come up to a table, place both of your hands on it and grab a towel. Next, relax your shoulders
},
{
    106.3,112.28
     and bend forward at your hips to slide your arms forward. Hold there for a second and
},
{
    112.28,119.36
     slide back. This helps you bring your shoulders into a motion that elevates your arms without
},
{
    119.36,125.04
     forcing you to move it against gravity. Now this motion should not be painful.
},
{
    125.04,130.04
     If it is painful, try going in a shoulder pain-free range.
},
{
    130.48,132.88
     I recommend trying to start this exercise out
},
{
    132.88,135.6
     with three sets of 10, at least once per day.
},
{
    135.6,138.92
     While the table slides help your arm move out forward,
},
{
    138.92,142.2
     moving out to the side, a motion called abduction,
},
{
    142.2,144.54
     often feels different on your shoulder.
},
{
    144.54,147.24
     You can use a dowel to help with this motion.
},
{
    147.24,152.52
     Today we're using a PVC pipe, but you could use anything straight at home like a cane,
},
{
    152.52,155.96
     a golf club, or even a broomstick if it was sturdy enough.
},
{
    155.96,161.28
     First what you'll do is put the dowel in both hands, but make sure that the hand on
},
{
    161.28,164.64
     the painful shoulder has the palm facing forward.
},
{
    164.64,165.8
     Next, use the
},
{
    165.8,171.64
     good shoulder to push out to your side, hold for a second, and then come on down.
},
{
    171.64,176.72
     It's important to note that with this exercise the painful shoulder should be
},
{
    176.72,182.02
     relaxed the whole time. The good shoulder during this exercise controls the motion
},
{
    182.02,186.6
     on the way up and also controls the motion on the way down.
},
{
    186.6,189.6
     Make sure though that you don't bring this stick
},
{
    189.6,191.12
     all the way back behind your head
},
{
    192.2,194.58
     or out too far in front of you.
},
{
    194.58,198.0
     You're trying to bring your bicep up to your ear.
},
{
    198.0,199.12
     It's also important to remember
},
{
    199.12,201.78
     that this motion should not be painful.
},
{
    201.78,205.84
     If it is painful, try going in a shorter pain-free range.
},
{
    206.48,213.84
     I recommend trying this exercise for three sets at ten once a day.
},
