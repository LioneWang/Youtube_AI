},
{
    92.32,93.52
     Outstanding, Bob.
},
{
    93.52,94.36
     Clear these out, Brad.
},
{
    94.36,96.96
     Yep, we gotta have some room.
},
{
    96.96,99.88
     So chest muscle pain, we've already mentioned,
},
{
    99.88,103.56
     we're talking about the pectoralis major, you know,
},
{
    103.56,105.28
     and the minor as well.
},
{
    105.28,106.44
     Probably mostly a major.
},
{
    106.44,107.76
     Yeah, mostly a major.
},
{
    107.76,109.52
     Obviously not the heart muscles
},
{
    109.52,112.56
     where no cardiac information here whatsoever.
},
{
    112.56,115.0
     Right, you wanna make sure that you're not having chest pain
},
{
    115.0,116.56
     due to a cardiac problem.
},
{
    116.56,117.4
     Exactly.
},
{
    117.4,118.76
     Let's make sure that's been ruled out.
},
{
    118.76,119.72
     Exactly.
},
{
    119.72,121.92
     So, you know, the chest muscles,
},
{
    121.92,123.96
     if you strain the muscle,
},
{
    123.96,126.92
     it's one of those that, you know, you've had it strain.
},
{
    126.92,129.24
     I've actually, right now I'm dealing with one right now
},
{
    129.24,130.86
     from swimming, which is-
},
{
    130.86,132.48
     Yeah, I remember you taking the massage
},
{
    132.48,133.32
     into it every time.
},
{
    133.32,134.16
     Right, absolutely.
},
{
    134.16,136.24
     We're gonna talk about that a little bit.
},
{
    136.24,139.04
     But first of all, let's talk about the anatomy,
},
{
    139.04,139.88
     the location.
},
{
    139.88,141.36
     We know the location basically,
},
{
    141.36,147.8
     but we need to go a little more in depth and detail, particularly for the 90 second treatment
},
{
    147.8,149.92
     that I'm gonna show you in just a little bit.
},
{
    149.92,154.92
     So here we're gonna use Sam and I've got some Kinesio tape
},
{
    154.92,159.0
     we're gonna use as a model to demonstrate this.
},
{
    159.0,162.96
     The green tape represents the lower fibers,
},
{
    162.96,165.8
     connects from the humerus down to the chest across.
},
{
    165.8,166.96
     It's a big fan muscle.
},
{
    166.96,168.6
     There's three particular sets.
},
{
    168.6,170.2
     Then there's the middle fibers,
},
{
    170.2,173.04
     which is the orange and then the red fibers.
},
{
    173.04,176.88
     And the pec minor is buried underneath the pec major.
},
{
    176.88,179.04
     Now these are actual colors of-
},
{
    179.04,181.0
     I'm joking though of course.
},
{
    181.0,183.68
     No, no, so we're looking at all this.
},
{
    183.68,187.56
     Now when you pull a muscle, typically you don't pull,
},
{
    187.56,190.12
     I would say almost always you don't pull the whole,
},
{
    190.12,193.08
     all the fibers across the whole fan of the muscle.
},
{
    193.08,194.0
     It's typically.
},
{
    194.0,194.96
     A micro tear.
},
{
    194.96,198.84
     A micro tear or a few fibers in one of these locations.
},
{
    198.84,199.68
     Strain.
},
{
    199.68,200.52
     Exactly.
},
{
    200.52,201.34
     People call it strain.
},
{
    201.34,204.6
     So keep that in mind when we show this 90 second treatment.
},
{
    204.6,205.74
     So.
},
{
    205.74,207.84
     You can see as I'm bringing the arm out here
},
{
    207.84,209.96
     how the fibers are starting to stretch.
},
{
    209.96,213.8
     Which is, as we said, the most common mistake,
},
{
    213.8,215.5
     that's the mistake.
},
{
    215.5,217.68
     You pull your chest muscle and you think,
},
{
    217.68,219.42
     oh, I better stretch it.
},
{
    219.42,221.28
     I got a muscle strain.
},
{
    221.28,223.72
     So what people do is they start stretching.
},
{
    223.72,226.18
     What happens is you've already got a tore muscle,
},
{
    226.18,230.74
     micro tears in it, maybe, macro tears.
},
{
    230.74,233.48
     And then you stretch it and you just re-tear it
},
{
    233.48,235.24
     or tear it worse.
},
{
    235.24,236.48
     Do not do that.
},
{
    236.48,239.0
     Allow it to heal, give it some time,
},
{
    239.0,241.52
     work on our 90 second treatment I'm gonna show you.
},
{
    241.52,243.24
     Again, not too long, just be careful.
},
{
    243.24,245.48
     Not only you and gonna probably hold off
},
{
    245.48,249.16
     on doing like bench press or push ups for a while.
},
{
    249.16,251.32
     Anything that aggravates it.
},
{
    251.32,254.88
     Flies, flies are really gonna get after it.
},
{
    254.88,255.72
     Way back.
},
{
    255.72,256.92
     Exactly.
},
{
    256.92,258.4
     So keep this in mind.
},
{
    258.4,261.4
     You're gonna allow this muscle some rest time.
},
{
    262.88,264.44
     Okay.
},
{
    264.44,267.0
     So here it is, the 90 second treatment.
},
{
    267.0,268.72
     Now you could do this one in bed,
},
{
    268.72,270.48
     doesn't matter, carpeted floor.
},
{
    270.48,272.2
     You know, you could do it on a hard floor if you want,
},
{
    272.2,273.72
     but it's not that comfortable.
},
{
    274.92,277.48
     You wanna throw me the pillow right there, Bob.
},
{
    277.48,279.16
     Get a pillow, get comfortable.
},
{
    279.16,281.4
     Yep, that one will be fine.
},
{
    281.4,282.68
     I'm gonna use a throw pillow.
},
{
    282.68,283.52
     That's good.
},
{
    283.52,286.0
     You could do this actually on your couch too,
},
{
    286.0,288.68
     assuming this would be the injured arm.
},
{
    288.68,292.44
     The injured arm was away from the backrest.
},
{
    292.44,295.48
     Okay, now remember, these fibers are going this way.
},
{
    295.48,297.0
     In order to get this,
},
{
    297.0,299.24
     it's called a positional release treatment
},
{
    299.24,301.16
     or strain counter strain.
},
{
    301.16,307.02
     We need to get the fibers of the muscle where it's injured as short as possible
},
{
    307.02,310.22
     in a very relaxed and pain-free position.
},
{
    310.22,313.66
     So in order to do that, I'm gonna take my arm
},
{
    313.66,318.14
     and bring it over and this shortens the muscle fibers.
},
{
    318.14,320.42
     And then because it's such a broad muscle,
},
{
    320.42,324.18
     it's gonna make a difference whether I have my elbow here,
},
{
    324.18,325.2
     up here, whether I have my elbow here, up here,
},
{
    325.2,328.52
     whether I rotate my arm in this way or out this way,
},
{
    328.52,331.08
     it's probably gonna be more comfortable this way.
},
{
    331.08,333.12
     But you'll know, cause you're gonna feel it.
},
{
    333.12,333.96
     So-
},
{
    333.96,335.16
     So they're gonna experiment basically.
},
{
    335.16,336.52
     Exactly.
},
{
    336.52,338.0
     And you're the boss on this.
},
{
    338.0,340.12
     There's no therapist that could tell you
},
{
    340.12,341.96
     which position it is because
},
{
    341.96,343.36
     you're gonna listen to your body.
},
{
    343.36,344.64
     You're looking for the position
},
{
    344.64,346.64
     that is the least amount of pain?
},
{
    346.64,348.0
     Yeah, exactly.
},
{
    348.0,350.68
     Matter of fact, I'm gonna do this on my left side
},
{
    350.68,354.84
     because that is the muscle that I'm particularly,
},
{
    354.84,357.2
     I got a real minor problem with this, not a major one.
},
{
    357.2,360.04
     So that's why you can kind of move around
},
{
    360.04,361.28
     to see where yours feels the best.
},
{
    361.28,363.16
     All right, so I'm gonna do it for real here.
},
{
    363.16,365.84
     I go this way, so,
},
{
    365.84,366.68
     actually,
},
{
    368.52,370.0
     down here.
},
{
    370.0,371.0
     That's where it feels best.
},
{
    371.0,372.44
     Yep, there.
},
{
    372.44,374.48
     Yeah, when I move my hand up there,
},
{
    374.48,376.76
     it turned the pain off, it feels good.
},
{
    376.76,378.52
     And now the critical part of this,
},
{
    378.52,380.08
     and there's no cheating on this,
},
{
    380.08,381.6
     you need to get a timer,
},
{
    381.6,382.6
     and you got a timer,
},
{
    382.6,384.72
     so when you find that comfortable position,
},
{
    384.72,388.36
     time it for 90 seconds, minimum.
},
{
    388.36,390.72
     You can go up to 120 seconds a couple minutes
},
{
    390.72,394.24
     or even a little longer, but for sure 90 seconds.
},
{
    394.24,395.88
     And that takes a little while.
},
{
    395.88,398.36
     You'd be surprised how long 90 seconds takes,
},
{
    398.36,401.08
     but if you're comfortable, just relax and breathe.
},
{
    401.08,404.92
     I'm not gonna do that here because it makes people bored.
},
{
    404.92,408.44
     But when you get done with the 90 seconds or two minutes,
},
{
    408.44,410.68
     then you're gonna slowly open it up.
},
{
    410.68,411.92
     You're not gonna open up
},
{
    411.92,414.42
     and start stretching aggressively whatsoever,
},
{
    414.42,415.96
     but you're gonna open it up
},
{
    415.96,419.8
     and then there's not gonna be any particular exercises
},
{
    419.8,422.6
     or activity for the next half hour or so.
},
{
    422.6,424.96
     It's a time, you know, you can do some gentle massage
},
{
    424.96,426.48
     in there to loosen it up.
},
{
    426.48,428.88
     And you're gonna do that two or three times a day.
},
{
    428.88,430.68
     You're gonna know if this is the right thing
},
{
    430.68,433.04
     because it's gonna feel good.
},
{
    433.04,436.64
     What happens is a muscle, when it's at a certain position,
},
{
    436.64,438.52
     it allows it to relax.
},
{
    438.52,439.36
     Completely.
},
{
    439.36,441.0
     Yep, when it completely relaxes,
},
{
    441.0,443.24
     blood flow gets to the injured area
},
{
    443.24,445.64
     and then your healing is accelerated,
},
{
    445.64,447.16
     and that's what we need.
},
{
    447.16,450.04
     So I would think that you do wanna throw some massage
},
{
    450.04,451.16
     in there eventually though too.
},
{
    451.16,454.76
     Exactly, and you know that may be within a day or two.
},
{
    454.76,457.04
     You can start with massaging with your hand,
},
{
    457.04,460.84
     the fibers, you know, go this way, this way, or this way,
},
{
    460.84,463.96
     and mine, my fibers in here, I'm gonna go in there.
},
{
    463.96,465.32
     So he's going cross.
},
{
    465.32,466.68
     Across, yep.
},
{
    466.68,468.24
     Fibers, the fibers run this way
},
{
    468.24,470.48
     and he's going across the fibers.
},
{
    470.48,473.8
     And you can get in pretty deep, you know, depending on,
},
{
    473.8,475.96
     you know, some of these guys got these massive
},
{
    475.96,477.44
     pectoralis muscles.
},
{
    477.44,478.28
     And that-
},
{
    478.28,480.96
     You're kind of on the armpit there a little bit.
},
{
    480.96,482.8
     And it does go up into the armpit,
},
{
    482.8,483.92
     but it could be up here too.
},
{
    483.92,485.96
     Yep, yep, it very well could be up here.
},
{
    487.08,489.48
     So you're gonna work that cross-fixion from massage
},
{
    489.48,491.0
     until your fingers get tired.
},
{
    491.0,492.42
     As long as it doesn't irritate it,
},
{
    492.42,495.36
     after 30 seconds of this,
},
{
    495.36,496.88
     you're gonna assess it.
},
{
    496.88,497.72
     Is it feeling better?
},
{
    497.72,499.78
     Is it feeling, or is it getting irritated?
},
{
    499.78,501.04
     If it feels better,
},
{
    501.04,503.68
     you're gonna continue to go until your fingers get tired.
},
{
    503.68,506.56
     And after doing this for a few days
},
{
    506.56,508.76
     or whatever time it is as it improves,
},
{
    508.76,510.32
     your hands are gonna get tired.
},
{
    510.32,515.32
     And this is where, if you happen to have a massage gun,
},
{
    515.48,518.16
     because a lot of people who exercise are getting these,
},
{
    519.16,521.32
     including Bob and I, we really like these.
},
{
    521.32,523.8
     We have our own massage gun.
},
{
    523.8,524.64
     Our own massage gun.
},
{
    524.64,526.16
     So Bob and Brad are right on it.
},
{
    526.16,527.2
     Very high quality.
},
{
    527.2,528.12
     Exactly.
},
{
    528.12,529.6
     Do we need to say that?
},
{
    529.6,531.28
     Well, we wouldn't put our name on it
},
{
    531.28,533.16
     unless we had complete faith in it.
},
{
    533.16,536.38
     So what we're gonna do with this is we're going to,
},
{
    537.84,539.56
     you put it out of high level.
},
{
    539.56,540.72
     This has five levels.
},
{
    540.72,542.88
     I'm gonna go to level four.
},
{
    542.88,544.44
     And they come with different heads too.
},
{
    544.44,546.84
     And he's got the round head on there right now.
},
{
    547.96,550.76
     Yeah, and this is so much easier
},
{
    550.76,552.52
     than with the fingers.
},
{
    552.52,554.76
     And you can work this longer time.
},
{
    554.76,556.72
     It's nice, once you have a massage gun in the house,
},
{
    556.72,558.88
     the whole family can use it.
},
{
    558.88,559.72
     You can pass it around.
},
{
    559.72,561.92
     And also you have it then for any problem
},
{
    561.92,562.76
     that crops up.
},
{
    562.76,563.6
     Exactly.
},
{
    563.6,566.04
     And as you get older, they crop up.
},
{
    566.04,567.56
     Or if you're just an active family,
},
{
    567.56,572.56
     I've got a friend, his son's in hockey and football
},
{
    573.0,576.28
     and he's active and his wife uses it.
},
{
    576.28,577.92
     But anyways, you're gonna say,
},
{
    577.92,580.24
     well, what do you do after it starts feeling better?
},
{
    580.24,581.92
     Get back to your exercises,
},
{
    581.92,587.08
     but back off on the intensity a lot, at least 50% or more to start with.
},
{
    587.08,588.6
     You're gonna take it on incrementally.
},
{
    588.6,590.5
     So like, yeah, you can go back to bench press,
},
{
    590.5,592.56
     but you maybe just start with the bar.
},
{
    592.56,593.4
     Yeah.
},
{
    593.4,595.72
     You know, 45 pounds, I mean, or whatever you're using.
},
{
    595.72,596.56
     Right.
},
{
    596.56,598.6
     And the length of time, in my case for swimming,
},
{
    598.6,601.84
     I used to swim usually 45 minutes to an hour.
},
{
    601.84,604.92
     I'm going about 20 to 30 minutes now at a low level,
},
{
    604.92,605.76
     and I'm building up.
},
{
    605.76,606.6
     So you got.
},
{
    606.6,609.4
     You can tell when it feels like it's getting strained
},
{
    609.4,610.58
     then you want to back off.
},
{
    610.58,611.84
     Listen to your body.
},
{
    611.84,613.4
     You got to respect it.
},
{
    613.4,616.76
     So once again, Bob, we can fix just about anything except
},
{
    616.76,617.84
     for a broken heart.
},
{
    617.84,618.96
     But this is close.
},
{
    618.96,619.8
     It is close.
},
{
    619.8,620.64
     Absolutely.
},
{
    620.64,621.48
     We're in the area.
},
{
    621.48,622.48
     We're in the neighborhood.
},
{
    622.48,625.0
     We're going to get a whole pamphlet on this, I'm thinking.
},
{
    625.0,626.8
     And, you know, we'll see how it goes.
},
{
    626.8,628.36
     All right, thanks for watching.
},
