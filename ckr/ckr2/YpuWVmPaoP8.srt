     Bob and Brad, the two most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    9.28,16.08
     I'm a high folks, I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist, Brad Heineck physical therapist, we're the most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    16.08,20.32
     In our opinion of course, Bob. How to fix a bulging disc, no surgery
},
{
    20.88,26.16
     That's the goal of physical therapy, we don't want to send you to the surgeon if we can avoid it
},
{
    26.16,30.8
     There's nothing more exciting as a therapist is have someone come in that's scheduled for surgery
},
{
    30.8,37.2
     And they give one chance to therapy and you take care of the problem life and it happens
},
{
    37.2,44.56
     Our belief is the body wants to heal itself and it's amazing the abilities it has so we're gonna show you some options today
},
{
    44.56,46.94
     We got three options but before we do oh
},

     very exciting news very exciting news if you go over to Facebook Bob and Brad we
},
{
    58.74,64.26
     are giving away a mattress actually we along with sleep ovations sleep giving a
},
{
    64.26,67.1
     very nice mattress I've been on it for a week now
},
{
    67.1,72.2
     I love it. It's like my mattress is giving me a hug Brad. I'm serious
},
{
    72.48,78.12
     It's like I'm getting molested by a mattress. Don't tell your wife that. I already did this morning
},
{
    78.12,80.78
     But anyway, all you have to do is there's a post on there
},
{
    80.78,85.9
     It's the top post on the page. You'll like it and you comment and you are in the contest.
},
{
    85.9,93.1
     There you go. All right, you're in charge. A bulging disc leads to a herniated disc which
},
{
    93.1,98.68
     can lead to the quote-unquote sequestered disc, you know that's technical terms that means you've got
},
{
    98.68,105.58
     a lot of pain, you have pain down the leg, sciatica, all those things the sooner you get after it the better
},
{
    105.58,112.08
     okay so we're gonna look at a herniated disc right here or a bulging disc oh
},
{
    112.08,122.48
     no my pencil Bob thank goodness saved. Can you zoom in on that Liz? So here if
},
{
    122.48,125.08
     you look at now you don't have a red disc and the other
},
{
    125.08,128.96
     ones are these colors that just so it highlights the involved one but this is
},
{
    128.96,134.16
     a really common area for disc to bulge between L4 and L5 and right on here you
},
{
    134.16,138.44
     see this nerve right here it's pushing on that nerve which that leads to the
},
{
    138.44,143.0
     sciatica and we want to eliminate that get that bulge back in where it belongs
},
{
    143.0,145.44
     so that's what we're gonna show you how to do we got three
},
{
    146.0,152.96
     good options. Three ways to try. The first one Brad is going to be extension sometimes this causes
},
{
    152.96,160.32
     the bulge and a lot of times this helps reduce the bulge but we've done whole videos on this we're
},
{
    160.32,169.28
     not going to go too crazy on it today you. Basically the idea is you're going to get down, you're going to probably start just prone like this for a little while, then
},
{
    169.28,173.48
     probably you're going to try up on your elbows for a little while. In every case you're looking
},
{
    173.48,178.92
     for a reduction of symptoms down the leg. Right, precisely Bob. So if this makes your
},
{
    178.92,184.08
     leg symptoms worse, you're going to have to try some other things or try different variations
},
{
    184.08,186.64
     of it. Again we've done full videos on this
},
{
    186.64,188.64
     Just type in Bob and Brad
},
{
    188.64,195.2
     herniated disc or sciatica and right because we're gonna spend more time today on the traction part of things
},
{
    195.2,198.2
     But eventually you're gonna start working on extensions here
},
{
    198.2,201.56
     Sure, you're gonna go ahead your hands underneath your shoulders
},
{
    201.56,206.28
     You're gonna do half press ups like this and eventually you want to do full press-ups and again
},
{
    206.28,209.12
     The idea is reduce the symptoms and the legs
},
{
    209.12,215.8
     Right so if you get pain at the white stick represents the pain if it's coming up like this and goes to the back
},
{
    216.16,219.48
     That's a good sign if it gets worse and goes down the leg
},
{
    219.48,223.88
     That means the bulge is too far out and we need to probably go to the options
},
{
    223.88,228.88
     We're gonna talk about. Could you show one way not to do it with the hips coming up? Oh sure
},
{
    228.88,234.72
     Yeah, this is very common your back is tight so what happens is your pelvis starts coming up like this
},
{
    234.72,238.84
     That's do not do it that way. You're not helping right. It's just not doing anything
},
{
    238.96,242.96
     It's very good. You're in neutral basically. Can you go over this way?
},
{
    242.96,244.04
     You're in neutral basically. Can you go over this way?
},
{
    249.18,253.78
     Listen now, this is we're gonna talk about traction now, right? Traction was started It's been around for literally thousands of years if you look in the history of a bit
},
{
    254.62,260.3
     Really in the 1950s in modern medicine is when it was used started to be used a lot more in the 60s
},
{
    260.82,264.58
     Probably not as much anymore. We were discussing we don't really know exactly why
},
{
    264.82,266.08
     But you can just
},
{
    266.08,272.08
     hang your body as a form of traction without getting a traction unit. And it's nice like this,
},
{
    272.08,277.04
     if you have a pull-up bar or a bar that you can hang on, that's safe to hang on with your body weight.
},
{
    277.04,283.52
     And now I'm going to gently take the weight off of my feet, but I got about 50% of my weight to my
},
{
    283.52,285.6
     feet and I'm relaxing my core muscles
},
{
    285.6,290.08
     around my stomach and back and I'm allowing the weight of my hips and legs to be traction
},
{
    290.8,297.36
     through that low back and if you do this in your back and particularly if your leg feels better
},
{
    297.36,301.28
     you're going to want to do this more often. Yeah and then you can do it quite often, you can do it
},
{
    301.28,306.32
     every hour if you have access to a bar. Sure, but the idea is again
},
{
    306.32,312.92
     he's pulling the lumbar vertebrae apart it's helping suck that ball gin. Right exactly because a disc is not
},
{
    312.92,321.32
     solid it has gel inside and that's what bulges out and we get that to reduce so we call it or go back in where it belongs.
},
{
    321.32,327.76
     Yeah remember that one image where they used a jelly donut I think we we did it one time too. Yeah. Like the jelly inside the donut was the disc.
},
{
    327.76,329.76
     That's been a few years since we've done that video.
},
{
    330.28,334.58
     You know for me, I like to do this just because it feels great on my back.
},
{
    334.58,336.34
     You put your feet out like that sometimes too?
},
{
    336.34,339.84
     Sometimes I do. You know for me, I've been you know after you do this for a while
},
{
    339.84,343.24
     and you know how your back responds to it, you'll figure things out.
},
{
    343.24,345.52
     But if you're doing this in the throes of
},
{
    352.46,358.34
     sciatica or that bulging disc, you're gonna take your time with it and then come back off and see how it responds after you've hung for you know 15-20 seconds and as long as it feels better than it did before sometimes
},
{
    358.34,361.62
     I'll have a tough patient where we'll do this and
},
{
    362.58,364.12
     then
},
{
    364.12,368.94
     Or it comes right back. Oh sure. You know it all depends. I've got one right now that I'm working with
},
{
    368.94,375.94
     and he says pretty tough. I haven't done this lumbar traction yet but it'd be an excellent option. Alright so let's move on to this Brad.
},
{
    375.94,389.44
     Now this is a portable as you can see. What does that weigh Brad? Well I would say it weighs about 19.5 pounds. You know that? No. I think it's more not. I think it's about
},
{
    389.44,393.68
     I mean because you and I are both strong like bull you know we can do curls with it.
},
{
    393.68,398.52
     I would say it's about 30. It could be. It's not bad. It does have wheels you can
},
{
    398.52,409.0
     roll it around and there inside. So usually when I have, I use this with someone, I haven't do it on a carpeted floor or a floor
},
{
    409.0,415.6
     but you can do it on a bed if it's a firm bed. So you just open it up like that. Now I'm gonna,
},
{
    415.6,428.72
     Bob's volunteered to do this. You got to get it adjusted, right? Now when I work this with a patient, typically you're not just gonna buy one of these and
},
{
    428.72,431.92
     do it if you're a layperson and have no experience whatsoever.
},
{
    431.92,435.32
     It's good to get instructions from a therapist.
},
{
    435.32,438.2
     You can, yeah, eventually you'll be able to set this up on your own.
},
{
    438.2,442.36
     Oh right, yep, I've had patients, you know, they work well for them.
},
{
    442.36,447.0
     They buy one or their insurance company buys one, they take it home and use it on a daily basis
},
{
    447.0,449.0
     and do everything independently.
},
{
    449.0,450.0
     How am I?
},
{
    450.0,451.0
     Am I right there?
},
{
    451.0,453.0
     Oh Bob, I'm thinking you're good.
},
{
    453.0,454.0
     Okay.
},
{
    454.0,455.0
     There you go.
},
{
    455.0,458.0
     So these all work well, just simple clips.
},
{
    458.0,464.0
     And like I said, I'll set up people initially, we're going to do this together so it just takes up less time.
},
{
    464.0,470.14
     Because we don't want you to get bored on YouTube. I could sing. Yeah you could
},
{
    470.14,475.7
     sing then we would be losing viewers. By the pound floor. You want to tighten those
},
{
    475.7,480.86
     up for the right? They tighten really easy just simply pull and they lock. There we go.
},
{
    480.86,486.52
     So the pressure is going here two of these two go here around the pelvis up here
},
{
    486.8,492.9
     Just below and then a lower rib cage. So these two are going to separate and pull me apart make me even taller
},
{
    493.04,497.84
     Yeah, Bob's going to go from six foot six to six foot seven by the end of this
},
{
    497.84,500.96
     So this pump has three settings the one setting is pump
},
{
    501.24,504.68
     Which then it's going to apply the pressure and separate me
},
{
    504.68,508.16
     Then there's a hold that you can put it on once you get to where you want to be.
},
{
    508.16,509.16
     Sure.
},
{
    509.16,510.16
     And then there's a release.
},
{
    510.16,511.16
     Right.
},
{
    511.16,513.36
     And this is all pneumatic, so it's air pressure.
},
{
    513.36,514.36
     There's no hydraulic fluid.
},
{
    514.36,518.08
     I'm going to go pump first so you can see it's just really easy to do.
},
{
    518.08,524.12
     It's actually, when I separate it, it's added air and also when I push down it's added air.
},
{
    524.12,526.18
     I think that's like a dual action. Is that it?
},
{
    526.18,533.8
     I think look right here you can see these two pieces of light color and a dark color plastic is separating and that's putting the
},
{
    534.0,539.22
     traction through Bob's low back and how many pounds of pressure do you got? I'm at
},
{
    539.68,541.68
     50 right now. 50?
},
{
    541.68,547.08
     You know we were talking about this it it doesn't feel like a lot at 50. I'm gonna
},
{
    547.08,552.96
     probably go up to 60 to start off with, but I know I could go higher than that. I think
},
{
    552.96,559.08
     it's pulling my pants down too. Oh Bob, it's a family show. Okay, but I'm now seven feet
},
{
    559.08,570.1
     tall. So there's different ways you can position the person you can go like this if this feels good for the person and their leg symptoms and the pain is
},
{
    570.56,574.6
     Improving I'll go like this. I would say more times and none
},
{
    574.6,580.78
     I do use this leg wedge just because and that would be a lot more comfortable and it is more comfortable
},
{
    580.8,589.12
     Can you lift up one more time? There we go. Yeah that's that's really comfortable. This does not come with the unit. You have to
},
{
    589.12,594.32
     purchase that separately. It's about $25-$30 but boy they really work well. So
},
{
    594.32,600.24
     how much is the unit? That's incredible. I'm glad you asked Bob. $375.
},
{
    600.24,604.88
     They've come down over the years. They come way down. I remember a patient
},
{
    604.88,606.0
     paying I mean he was pretty upset actually because they had told him 600 and They've come down over the years. They've come way down. I remember a patient pain,
},
{
    606.0,608.0
     I mean he was pretty upset actually,
},
{
    608.0,610.0
     because they had told him 600 and it ended up being over a thousand.
},
{
    610.0,612.0
     Sure.
},
{
    612.0,614.0
     It's like everything has been around for a while,
},
{
    614.0,616.0
     production and whatnot.
},
{
    616.0,619.0
     I do want to mention the pressure on that.
},
{
    619.0,622.0
     I do not go by the pound so much.
},
{
    622.0,624.0
     I do keep track of it, but I'm always
},
{
    624.0,625.44
     asking my patient
},
{
    625.44,629.24
     how does it feel is it getting better is it getting worse is there any creating
},
{
    629.24,633.2
     any pain if it creates pain particularly down the leg the numbness
},
{
    633.2,638.04
     detangling those things get worse we do not go any further it may be that's not
},
{
    638.04,644.0
     appropriate for for the person I would also the time span I would start off at
},
{
    644.0,645.16
     a very short time span,
},
{
    645.16,648.78
     wouldn't you? I usually go five minutes. Right, I wouldn't go beyond that the first
},
{
    648.78,652.88
     time, even if it feels good. Just do five minutes, see how you react afterwards.
},
{
    652.88,656.32
     Because you never know, sometimes it might feel worse after and
},
{
    656.32,661.96
     if you went ten minutes you can't take that back. Right, precisely. So five
},
{
    661.96,665.68
     minutes let off on the pressure and then have that makes you
},
{
    665.68,670.64
     your stand up and see how you respond with weight going through your back because that can be a
},
{
    670.64,676.16
     game changer there. You should have positive results. You should stand up oh if it feels good the leg
},
{
    676.16,681.44
     pain feels better and when you're walking around then you go up to 10 minutes you know up to 20
},
{
    681.44,686.96
     minutes you can go on this and if you you get those positive results, the leg pain is getting better every time,
},
{
    687.08,689.88
     every time you get up, move around, it feels better. You know,
},
{
    689.88,692.04
     you're going to do this, you know, two to three times a day.
},
{
    692.04,694.52
     Well, I would say beyond that, even Brad, if you, um,
},
{
    694.56,697.76
     if you have just a bad back, um, you might try to,
},
{
    697.8,699.96
     I had a patient that just had a terrible back,
},
{
    700.52,701.68
     arthritis and all that.
},
{
    701.92,705.2
     And he would just do this once a day to give himself relief for a maintenance
},
{
    705.2,709.66
     Yeah for maintenance, right, and I mean it was just it was that thing that he could get through the day
},
{
    709.66,713.68
     Sure, I'll be looking on time Brad. Oh we're doing great Bob. Were you at least that?
},
{
    713.68,719.82
     Oh, yeah, sure. Please release me. You can watch this and you'll see see how these come together
},
{
    720.04,722.68
     There's coming out right now. You can hear it. There we go
},
{
    723.44,726.98
     Yep, and then I can just unbuckle. Yep go ahead
},
{
    728.7,732.36
     Big question. All right. Am I smarter too?
},
{
    732.88,735.28
     Taller and smarter there you go. Oh
},
{
    735.84,742.28
     Look at that. He's feeling strong and looking tall not handsome yet, but he's still looking better, but I'm handy
},
{
    743.36,745.36
     All right. thanks everybody for watching.
},
