    0.0,5.2
     Hey everybody, it's Dr. Jo and Bumble Bear. Today I'm going to show you general stretches and
},
{
    5.2,11.28
     exercises for the wrist and the hand. This is the seventh day of my moderate 10-day whole body
},
{
    11.28,15.84
     wellness challenge. Want to find out more about it? Stick around to the end. So let's get started.
},
{
    24.0,28.68
     For the wrist-hand moderate routine, you're going to need a couple pieces of equipment.
},
{
    28.68,36.16
     First just a rolled up towel to do some twisting with two regular just rubber bands to do some
},
{
    36.16,42.22
     finger exercises and then a long piece of resistive band.
},
{
    42.22,43.22
     Sometimes they have loops.
},
{
    43.22,45.84
     This one you don't need a loop, but I do sometimes
},
{
    45.84,52.0
     like making a little loop at the bottom as a handle. For these exercises, if you happen to not have
},
{
    52.0,56.72
     resistive band, it's okay. You can do the exercises without the resistive bands, but since this is the
},
{
    56.72,62.0
     moderate routine, if you can progress into using resistive band, that's going to really be the best
},
{
    62.0,65.28
     option. So let's start off first with just a warm-up and
},
{
    65.28,70.72
     I'll kind of talk more as we go and get things going. So we're going to do a two-minute warm-up.
},
{
    71.52,75.36
     So let's just start with some arm circles because even though we're doing the wrist in the hand,
},
{
    75.36,81.28
     the whole arm and the shoulder area has a lot to do with that area as well. So doing some forwards,
},
{
    81.28,85.6
     backwards, clockwise, counterclockwise, however you wanna call it,
},
{
    85.6,87.72
     but just kinda getting those nice circles,
},
{
    87.72,91.0
     doing some one way, and then rotating back the other way.
},
{
    91.0,93.88
     So if you've been following along with the challenges
},
{
    93.88,95.28
     and done the beginner challenge
},
{
    95.28,96.84
     and ready for the moderate challenge
},
{
    96.84,99.2
     or just starting off with me now,
},
{
    99.2,102.48
     we're gonna go with 30 seconds for the exercises
},
{
    102.48,104.72
     and stretches versus how many reps.
},
{
    104.72,106.64
     So in that 30 second period,
},
{
    106.64,111.52
     you can do as much as you comfortably can. So if it's just a couple reps or if it's a
},
{
    111.52,115.6
     lot of reps and you're following along with me. So let's go into the wrist warm up here,
},
{
    115.6,122.48
     just kind of a up and down or flexion extension. So in between each individual one, we'll have a
},
{
    122.48,125.44
     short break. And then between the groups of stretches and exercises, we'll have a short break and then between the groups
},
{
    125.44,128.12
     of stretches and exercises, we'll have a long break.
},
{
    128.12,131.56
     So that's just kind of how that's going to work.
},
{
    131.56,134.92
     And again, if you've been following along with me, you know, you know, go at your own
},
{
    134.92,135.92
     pace.
},
{
    135.92,137.12
     Don't feel like you have to keep up with me.
},
{
    137.12,141.2
     If you have to take a little break in between, that's great too.
},
{
    141.2,146.4
     You just do what's most comfortable for you as we go along. And again, if you've
},
{
    146.4,150.96
     been doing these and maybe you've done this one a couple times already, and you know I'm
},
{
    150.96,154.76
     going to be talking a lot, explaining everything and showing you modifications. So if you want
},
{
    154.76,158.36
     to hit that mute button and play your own music, feel free to do that because you know,
},
{
    158.36,163.8
     I'm going to try and give you as many options and modifications as possible. And now just
},
{
    163.8,166.36
     opening and closing the hand.
},
{
    166.36,168.16
     Really spread out those fingers
},
{
    168.16,170.6
     and close them really just to get it nice and loose and up.
},
{
    170.6,173.64
     You might hear my fingers cracking just a little bit.
},
{
    173.64,175.68
     I think most physical therapists have a little bit
},
{
    175.68,179.04
     of arthritis in their fingers from pushing around
},
{
    179.04,181.28
     on those muscles and everything and getting them going.
},
{
    181.28,184.92
     So you might hear some cracks along the way.
},
{
    184.92,188.96
     So we're gonna start off with some resistive stuff. So go ahead and get ready to get your
},
{
    188.96,194.6
     resistive band. We're going to start off with some wrist flexion. You can do these in seated
},
{
    194.6,200.72
     or standing. I'm just going to do them seated. Make sure you anchor your band down with your
},
{
    200.72,209.2
     feet. I like to do both feet anchors just to make sure that everything is nice and steady and doing how it's supposed to. So going into
},
{
    209.2,214.68
     flexion we're going to come up this way with the band. So you know that flexion
},
{
    214.68,220.02
     movement coming in and you're just making sure you get enough tension that's
},
{
    220.02,223.72
     comfortable for you. So you see I had a little bit of slack in there but if that's
},
{
    223.72,229.12
     too much you can definitely take the take your feet away and give it a little bit more slack. But if you
},
{
    229.12,234.64
     want a little more resistance, you want to have that band kind of tight the whole time to give
},
{
    234.64,242.16
     you that nice resistance. If you need to put your arm on a table to start off with, you can do that
},
{
    242.16,246.0
     as well. Just for some support, but you don't have to.
},
{
    246.0,250.86
     You can just hold it up kind of like I am. You can even prop it on your knee if you want
},
{
    250.86,257.02
     to and going up this way into that flexion, nice all the way down. So you really want
},
{
    257.02,263.44
     to try and get that full range of motion if you can. Now, if you're just starting off
},
{
    263.44,268.12
     with the resistive bands, and maybe that's a little too much or going into that full range of motion maybe is
},
{
    268.12,272.48
     a little painful then you can either start here and just go to your neutral
},
{
    272.48,276.64
     position or if going into that extension is a little uncomfortable you can start
},
{
    276.64,281.64
     in the neutral position and go into that full flexion. So again make sure you're
},
{
    281.64,285.2
     doing what's comfortable for you with resistive bands.
},
{
    287.12,293.36
     Depending on the brand, the different colors are different resistances. So make sure you're
},
{
    293.36,298.8
     starting off with the light band if you haven't been doing resistive bands before, especially with
},
{
    298.8,303.68
     the wrist, finger hand area. Those are smaller muscles. It doesn't take quite as much to get
},
{
    303.68,305.06
     them going. These
},
{
    305.06,309.72
     are for kind of the elbow as well because those wrist extensors and flexors go all the
},
{
    309.72,315.6
     way up into the elbow. If you've got something like tennis elbow, golfer's elbow, those lateral
},
{
    315.6,322.12
     medial epicondylitis, these are great for those as well. So even though we're doing the wrist
},
{
    322.12,325.68
     hand, we're really kind of working that elbow area as well.
},
{
    325.68,326.52
     And so that's nice,
},
{
    326.52,329.28
     could you kind of get in those combo movements?
},
{
    329.28,330.48
     Exercise one.
},
{
    330.48,332.64
     So again, see, make sure you're anchoring it down
},
{
    332.64,336.4
     so that band doesn't smack you, come loose and smack you.
},
{
    336.4,337.76
     So make sure it's nice and anchored.
},
{
    337.76,340.16
     Again, that's why I kind of like using two feet.
},
{
    340.16,341.44
     If you've got shoes on,
},
{
    341.44,345.04
     usually that's a little bit better for the anchoring as well.
},
{
    348.64,354.08
     Again, that nice all the way through range if you can, if it's not painful for you.
},
{
    354.08,359.76
     A little bit of pain is sometimes okay as long as that pain stops as soon as you stop the exercise.
},
{
    360.48,370.16
     So the next one we're going to go into wrist extension. So now we're just going to turn our hand the other way and go into that extension motion.
},
{
    370.16,371.76
     So again, getting everything nice and anchored.
},
{
    371.76,377.12
     If you need to prop it up on a table or prop it up on your leg, that's sometimes the easiest
},
{
    377.12,378.12
     way to do it.
},
{
    378.12,380.1
     So you don't have to sit at a table if you don't want to.
},
{
    380.1,386.64
     And now this time you're going into that extension. And again, going all the way down if you can
},
{
    386.64,390.52
     and get that full range of motion in there.
},
{
    390.52,393.12
     And if you maybe want some resistance
},
{
    393.12,395.56
     but you don't happen to have the resistive bands,
},
{
    395.56,398.72
     you can also use a soup or vegetable can
},
{
    398.72,401.44
     or some people think I say super vegetable can
},
{
    401.44,402.84
     because it's super.
},
{
    402.84,404.12
     But you can use something like that.
},
{
    404.12,405.28
     Usually those are only about
},
{
    406.0,411.92
     one pound at the most depending on how big the can is if it's super. So you can also just hold
},
{
    411.92,417.52
     on to a small weight as well. But I personally like resistive bands a little bit better. They give
},
{
    417.52,422.56
     you a little bit more tension through the whole movement. So this time I'm going to do them without
},
{
    422.56,428.0
     propping up on the legs. So again, you can just kind of see how it is through there.
},
{
    429.28,433.76
     And again, now those wrist extensors again go all the way up into that elbow area.
},
{
    433.76,458.56
     So this is nice to kind of work on if you've got some tightness or weakness in those elbows as well. And then the same with this. If you feel like you can't go all the way through
},
{
    458.56,465.84
     the motion, that's okay. You can start in that neutral position and go up and stay in that neutral position there
},
{
    465.84,472.54
     Or maybe if that full extension is too much you can start down inflection and come up to right there
},
{
    472.54,477.32
     And so I'm gonna take my thumbnail picture right now. You can take it along with me if you want and
},
{
    479.12,481.12
     Then we'll keep on going through
},
{
    482.16,483.92
     pointing to that
},
{
    483.92,487.36
     Those wrist extensor muscles right there which we're working on.
},
{
    494.32,500.88
     And I would say even if you feel like these are easy in the beginning, I wouldn't increase the
},
{
    500.88,506.96
     resistance until maybe the next day and see how you feel. Because sometimes with
},
{
    506.96,513.44
     resistive bands, while you're doing it, you're like, hey, you know, this feels pretty easy, no problem.
},
{
    513.44,519.28
     But then a couple hours later or that night or the next day, you're kind of like, okay,
},
{
    519.28,529.84
     I could feel that they were worked. So maybe that was what I needed or maybe a little bit too much and so then you can do these without the resistive band so make sure
},
{
    529.84,533.36
     that you're listening to your body and if it's telling you it's a little too
},
{
    533.36,538.52
     much then back off of it just a little bit. So next we're gonna go into radial
},
{
    538.52,546.36
     deviation the the thumb side of the wrist in the hand, I always say thumbs up is rad, radial.
},
{
    546.36,550.08
     So now you're just gonna have your thumb up
},
{
    550.08,553.3
     and you're going into that radial deviation.
},
{
    553.3,556.26
     So kind of everything that we did with the others
},
{
    556.26,559.78
     for modifications if you need it are the same,
},
{
    559.78,564.32
     but really kind of try and get in that smooth motion
},
{
    564.32,567.84
     and keep your wrist here in a neutral position.
},
{
    567.84,571.76
     So it's not doing it out here and it's not doing it out here because that's going to really kind
},
{
    571.76,577.84
     of pinch that area. Try and keep that wrist in a neutral position really for this one and then going
},
{
    577.84,578.64
     up and down.
},
{
    589.36,594.6
     And then same thing over here. And if you want to prop it up on your leg or on a table, this would be the way just
},
{
    594.6,600.04
     make sure that your wrist is off of whatever is propped up on so it can get that full motion
},
{
    600.04,620.96
     in there going all the way down and then coming all the way up.
},
{
    624.08,625.56
     And you don't have to make the little loop handle like I have.
},
{
    625.56,627.6
     Sometimes it's hard to get these knots to stay.
},
{
    627.6,630.08
     You can just hold it like this if you want to.
},
{
    630.08,636.92
     But if you happen to have maybe some pain, tenderness, or some arthritis, especially in
},
{
    636.92,640.96
     your fingers, I find having the loop is a little bit better because then you don't have
},
{
    640.96,643.16
     to squeeze so hard to hold onto the band.
},
{
    643.16,648.48
     So that's just a little tip there. But I would definitely try and make the loop before you start because
},
{
    648.48,654.64
     sometimes it does this is you want to make sure again that that knot is tight. So then while you're
},
{
    654.64,659.68
     doing the exercises, it doesn't come loose and then kind of snap back at you because that's not
},
{
    659.68,668.12
     comfortable at all. And then again, same thing with these. If maybe that full motion is just
},
{
    668.12,671.88
     a little bit uncomfortable, you can modify by just starting in that neutral
},
{
    671.88,678.12
     position and coming up, or if that end range is a little bit uncomfortable, you
},
{
    678.12,681.92
     can start a little further down and then just come into that neutral position. And
},
{
    681.92,685.6
     then hopefully as you continue to do it and get stronger you'll
},
{
    685.6,692.24
     be able to go through that full motion with less pain or no pain at all. And again, a little bit
},
{
    692.24,698.48
     of pain is okay through the exercises as long as the pain stops once you stop the exercise.
},
{
    700.32,710.4
     So as you can imagine the next one is going to be ulnar deviations. So on this side, a lot of times I feel like it's easier because you can just go out this
},
{
    710.4,713.4
     way to hold the band in this position.
},
{
    713.4,716.08
     And now I'm going to go out towards that ulnar side.
},
{
    716.08,720.64
     So same kind of motion, but now we're just going to hold it up with the band like this
},
{
    720.64,725.04
     and then turn out until that ulnar deviation there.
},
{
    725.04,728.22
     So same thing, you want to keep that wrist in that neutral position.
},
{
    728.22,729.3
     You don't want it to be up.
},
{
    729.34,730.44
     You don't want it to be down.
},
{
    730.44,731.94
     You want it to be kind of straightforward.
},
{
    732.22,735.16
     And then you're just turning that hand out.
},
{
    735.18,741.22
     I'm going to kind of go downward so you can see a little bit that motion going out that way.
},
{
    741.44,745.46
     Again, if you want to hold on to the loop you can do still do that as
},
{
    745.46,749.46
     well. Just give yourself some tension on that other side and you're going out
},
{
    749.46,755.14
     that way. So again just coming back up instead of trying to anchor it and you
},
{
    755.14,757.62
     know turn your hand and go the other way because then that would probably be
},
{
    757.62,762.7
     pretty uncomfortable. So I'm just gonna hold so you can just hold this way. If
},
{
    762.7,767.52
     you wanted to do both at the same time, you could,
},
{
    767.52,774.0
     but I like doing one at a time for some of these because maybe one wrist is a little bit weaker
},
{
    774.0,778.32
     than the other. And so if you're doing them both at the same time, sometimes it's hard to push one
},
{
    778.32,784.48
     harder than the other. So I like kind of separating them out. But once you get the technique down
},
{
    784.48,786.58
     and everything feels good, if you're pressed for time
},
{
    786.58,789.3
     You can definitely do them both at the same time
},
{
    791.0,795.66
     So I'll go back to holding the loop this time. So again, you can just kind of see how that works
},
{
    797.94,799.6
     Holding here
},
{
    799.6,806.32
     And then turning out if maybe squeezing onto that band is a little uncomfortable on your fingers,
},
{
    806.32,809.96
     cause you could even, you know, have your fingers out
},
{
    809.96,812.26
     and do that deviation.
},
{
    812.26,813.46
     Same thing with all the other ones.
},
{
    813.46,817.2
     So if you're, you know, uncomfortable curling your fingers,
},
{
    817.2,819.56
     you can have them out.
},
{
    819.56,822.24
     And I'm still getting that ulnar deviation.
},
{
    822.24,823.68
     I just feel like if I make a fist,
},
{
    823.68,825.2
     sometimes I can get a little
},
{
    825.2,833.2
     bit better motion in there with that. And then I'll use the band over here for this one as well.
},
{
    840.8,850.84
     And then going out and again I'll turn this way a little bit so you can see it this way so that pinky side is coming over to the side but again in that neutral
},
{
    850.84,856.36
     position not down here not up here trying to keep that hand what we call
},
{
    856.36,865.0
     neutral position is that there's not really a bend there at the wrist so that's that straight flat area up on top there.
},
{
    870.24,873.4
     So the next couple of ones we're gonna do are full stretches.
},
{
    873.4,875.8
     So it's gonna be the full 30 second stretches.
},
{
    875.8,877.8
     We're gonna start off with a wrist flexor,
},
{
    877.8,881.08
     not wrist flexion, but a wrist flexor stretch,
},
{
    881.08,882.28
     those flexors underneath.
},
{
    882.28,884.32
     So a lot of times people get confused with that
},
{
    884.32,890.16
     because you're going into extension, but you're stretching those flexor muscles. So arm straight out
},
{
    890.16,896.84
     and just pull your fingers in an upwards position and you should feel those wrist flexors underneath
},
{
    896.84,903.16
     getting a nice stretch. Now if this is too much, if you're like, I'm feeling this a lot,
},
{
    903.16,906.72
     curl your fingers in and that'll be just a little bit
},
{
    906.72,911.84
     less of a stretch. And I'm turned a little bit so you can see it. Ideally you want to keep it
},
{
    912.48,917.28
     straight in front of you so you don't twist and get your back irritated. You can also do this
},
{
    917.28,927.92
     against a wall as well. But it's that full 30 second hold for this one. So maybe I'll turn a little bit so you can kind of see the angle on this one.
},
{
    927.92,932.6
     So again, fist, if it's too much, getting that,
},
{
    932.6,934.54
     and if that's not quite enough,
},
{
    934.54,936.8
     open up your hand and get that stretch.
},
{
    936.8,938.2
     And that's because those tendons come
},
{
    938.2,939.68
     all the way down into the fingers.
},
{
    939.68,942.3
     So it makes a difference if your fingers are up,
},
{
    942.3,943.48
     there's more of a stretch.
},
{
    943.48,946.86
     If they're curled, that's a little bit less of a stretch.
},
{
    946.86,949.22
     Try and keep that arm nice and straight.
},
{
    949.22,950.4
     With the elbow being straight,
},
{
    950.4,952.24
     that gives you that better stretch in there.
},
{
    952.24,955.82
     And I'm feeling that underneath right in there.
},
{
    960.52,962.12
     A lot of times with the stretches,
},
{
    962.12,966.8
     this is a great time to do some nice diaphragmatic breathing, breathe through the stretch.
},
{
    966.8,970.4
     A lot of times when you breathe in, as you let out, you can get a little bit more of a
},
{
    970.4,971.4
     stretch in there.
},
{
    971.4,999.68
     So just nice, steep breath. little bit more.
},
{
    1003.84,1005.72
     And again once you get the technique down if you're pressed time, you can stretch both of them at the same time
},
{
    1005.72,1008.4
     against the wall, just kind of place your hands on the wall.
},
{
    1008.4,1010.64
     But again, I like doing them separately
},
{
    1010.64,1013.32
     because one might be a little bit tighter than the other,
},
{
    1013.32,1015.16
     but if you feel comfortable stretching them both
},
{
    1015.16,1017.84
     at the same time, that saves a little bit of time
},
{
    1017.84,1020.16
     while you're doing it, getting that nice stretch in there.
},
{
    1020.16,1023.32
     And again, if that's too much, curl those fingers,
},
{
    1023.32,1035.92
     but you can still get that stretch in there.
},
{
    1040.24,1049.6
     So as you can guess the next one is going to be to stretch the wrist extensors. So we'll be going into a flexion motion this time to get the extensors, which are on the outside there.
},
{
    1049.6,1057.28
     So that would be something like a lateral epicondylitis or a tendis elbow, and then that inner one is that golfer's elbow or that medial
},
{
    1058.06,1059.9
     epicondylitis.
},
{
    1059.9,1066.56
     So this time you're going down in the motion and so it's the opposite this time.
},
{
    1066.56,1073.32
     So if I want more of a stretch, I'm going to curl my fingers in because those muscles come on the outside.
},
{
    1073.32,1076.36
     So curling them gives me a much better stretch in there.
},
{
    1076.36,1082.64
     But if that's too much, open up those fingers and then straighten them out and that'll get you just a little bit less stretch,
},
{
    1082.64,1087.0
     but still a pretty good stretch in there for that full 30 seconds.
},
{
    1087.0,1102.48
     And again, keeping that elbow nice and straight, bending in, curl those fingers if you want
},
{
    1102.48,1103.48
     just a little bit more.
},
{
    1103.48,1105.6
     And so that little muscle belly up top,
},
{
    1105.6,1106.84
     that's where those extensors are
},
{
    1106.84,1109.84
     and they come all the way down through there.
},
{
    1111.2,1115.28
     Some people might get a better stretch if they turn it in.
},
{
    1115.28,1116.44
     You might see some people do that,
},
{
    1116.44,1119.28
     even if you turn it out just a little bit,
},
{
    1119.28,1120.48
     just be a little bit aware
},
{
    1120.48,1123.16
     that some of those positions might be a little bit uncomfortable.
},
{
    1123.16,1124.84
     So not going into the big stretch,
},
{
    1124.84,1128.4
     if you wanna try a couple of those other positions. I feel like this position gives me
},
{
    1128.4,1134.56
     the best most comfortable stretch in there. And then shake them out a little bit if you need to in
},
{
    1134.56,1141.52
     between. And then I'll kind of do it across so you can see a little bit better this time. So fingers
},
{
    1141.52,1177.44
     down for a little bit less stretch. Fingers in. I really feel that stretch through there. And then I'll kind of cross over again so you can see a little bit better on this side.
},
{
    1177.44,1190.68
     So now just do fingers down this time. And the same with any kind of stretch. You might not be able to get your hand down as
},
{
    1190.68,1195.16
     far as I'm getting. You know, it might be just to hear before you feel a stretch. So
},
{
    1195.16,1199.64
     make sure you're not forcing that stretch where there's pain, pain. Stretching should
},
{
    1199.64,1205.36
     be uncomfortable tension, but you should be able to easily hold it for 30 seconds
},
{
    1205.36,1210.76
     without going or feeling like you're gonna cry while you're doing it. So the
},
{
    1210.76,1215.36
     next one is just gonna be some finger strengthening exercises. So something as
},
{
    1215.36,1220.24
     simple as rubber bands work really great. You can use the bigger resistive bands
},
{
    1220.24,1223.84
     if you have some, but I find that the smaller rubber bands do a better job
},
{
    1223.84,1229.92
     because again these muscles are small so you going to really feel it. Just wrap them around kind of
},
{
    1229.92,1236.08
     like this, and all you're doing is trying to open as far as you comfortably can and close nice and
},
{
    1236.08,1243.2
     slow. So just the same thing with the resistive bands you want to do both controlled out and
},
{
    1243.2,1246.6
     controlled back in. And you can see a little bit of difference here.
},
{
    1246.6,1249.08
     I've had some surgeries on both hands.
},
{
    1249.08,1251.56
     So you wanna just make sure the reason I'm not going
},
{
    1251.56,1252.92
     all the way open is
},
{
    1252.92,1254.92
     because I don't want the band to roll all the way down.
},
{
    1254.92,1257.28
     So make sure you're just controlling everything
},
{
    1257.28,1261.6
     while you do it and then nice and slow back in.
},
{
    1261.6,1264.72
     And I can really feel that it's just a rubber band.
},
{
    1264.72,1265.22
     If you still get a
},
{
    1265.22,1269.64
     newspaper sometimes there's rubber bands on newspapers. I don't know how many
},
{
    1269.64,1275.68
     people get newspapers anymore. My parents do. And then out and then nice and slow
},
{
    1275.68,1281.16
     back in. Sometimes they have thick ones on vegetables when you get vegetables
},
{
    1281.16,1287.68
     from the the fresh ones. And so you can probably find some somewhere without
},
{
    1287.68,1294.36
     having to buy any. So just out and then nice and slow back in. But like I said, you can
},
{
    1294.36,1298.92
     use the resistive bands. If you make that little loop, you can put it all the way around
},
{
    1298.92,1307.84
     your hands. So the next one is just going to be a towel squeeze or just a little bit of a towel twist.
},
{
    1307.84,1311.68
     You can kind of do both, but we're going to do both hands with these again instead of
},
{
    1311.68,1312.98
     doing both sides.
},
{
    1312.98,1317.84
     So just put wrapping your hands around the rolled up towel making it thick enough so
},
{
    1317.84,1321.88
     it you get a little push in there and just squeezing in.
},
{
    1321.88,1322.88
     That's all I'm doing.
},
{
    1322.88,1326.36
     And then I'm going to hold it for about three to five seconds
},
{
    1326.36,1327.56
     and then relax.
},
{
    1327.56,1331.44
     So not squeezing as hard as I can,
},
{
    1331.44,1333.36
     you can build up to that.
},
{
    1333.36,1336.16
     But this is almost like some of those isometric exercises
},
{
    1336.16,1338.92
     that we did in the beginner challenge
},
{
    1338.92,1342.24
     where you maybe start off with just 30 to 40%
},
{
    1342.24,1344.2
     and then each time you do it,
},
{
    1344.2,1346.24
     you can kind of increase that percentage.
},
{
    1346.24,1349.88
     But if you're getting to 100 percent, then you'd want to start a different
},
{
    1349.88,1350.8
     exercise.
},
{
    1352.08,1355.42
     And again, if you want to separate it out, you can do one at a time, but with
},
{
    1355.42,1360.1
     these, I feel like, maybe it's a little bit easier to squeeze with one versus the
},
{
    1360.1,1360.44
     other.
},
{
    1360.44,1364.92
     So a little double squeeze in there, uh, if you wanted to.
},
{
    1368.16,1374.8
     other so a little double squeeze in there if you wanted to. And you could also have two towels if you want and then have one in each hand squeezing but this is pretty easy to do as well just that
},
{
    1374.8,1384.08
     squeeze and then relax. You can bend your elbows too I have them out just so you can kind of see
},
{
    1384.08,1390.68
     what I'm doing but if it's more comfortable to bend your elbows, that's okay to do as well.
},
{
    1390.68,1395.4
     So now we're going to do some standing exercises back with the band again. And we're just going
},
{
    1395.4,1400.28
     to do things together because, again, it saves time just a little bit. And at the moderate
},
{
    1400.28,1408.96
     level, hopefully you've gotten some strength in there. So I'm just standing on both, putting my feet about hip shoulder width apart, and we're just
},
{
    1408.96,1416.08
     going to do a bicep curl. So just keeping those elbows by your side, coming up, and
},
{
    1416.08,1422.84
     then controlling it nice and slow back down. I'm kind of starting off coming with
},
{
    1422.84,1425.0
     my palms up towards me.
},
{
    1425.0,1430.64
     I'll show you kind of, you can do like a hammer curl for the second one.
},
{
    1430.64,1436.4
     But again, so just nice and slow and controlled because I have the resistance on both sides.
},
{
    1436.4,1441.28
     I'm feeling a little bit more resistance because there's more pull on the band with those.
},
{
    1441.28,1445.28
     So if you need to do one at a time, you can definitely do one at a time,
},
{
    1445.28,1449.52
     but hopefully by now you're feeling comfortable being able to do them both at the same time.
},
{
    1449.52,1454.56
     So again, keep those elbows pretty close. Now the thumb's going to be up kind of like a hammer curl
},
{
    1454.56,1461.2
     style, but make sure that you're controlling that band. Don't let that band control you just nice
},
{
    1461.92,1468.36
     and smooth motion. So you don't want to just go right back down, one because you're missing out on the exercise and two that actually kind of
},
{
    1468.36,1473.48
     hurt just a little bit. So you don't want to irritate something while you're
},
{
    1473.48,1476.72
     doing your exercise. That's why it's important to go so nice and controlled
},
{
    1476.72,1483.36
     with it. So then the next one's just going to be the opposite. We're going to do
},
{
    1483.36,1488.28
     some tricep either kick outs or some people call them tricep curls, tricep
},
{
    1488.28,1489.96
     push backs, a couple of different motions.
},
{
    1489.96,1492.16
     So still in the same position.
},
{
    1492.16,1496.64
     This time I'm going to bring my elbows kind of up because you're just doing the movement
},
{
    1496.64,1497.64
     at the elbow.
},
{
    1497.64,1503.08
     The top part of your arm stays in the same position and now I'm just kicking back.
},
{
    1503.08,1505.54
     So it's not kicking the whole arm back.
},
{
    1505.54,1508.82
     I'm just straightening out the elbows
},
{
    1508.82,1510.02
     and then coming back in.
},
{
    1510.02,1513.74
     So kind of getting that kickback motion.
},
{
    1513.74,1516.54
     I might be moving the top arm just a little bit,
},
{
    1516.54,1520.5
     but ideally, you can see I'm bending a little bit
},
{
    1520.5,1523.86
     at my hips to be able to get that big pushback.
},
{
    1523.86,1528.76
     If you feel a little uncomfortable, you can bend your knees a little bit too and do that kick out and
},
{
    1528.76,1532.4
     then that takes a little less tension off the resistive band too so it makes a
},
{
    1532.4,1537.6
     little bit easier so that would be a way to modify it as well. And if you want to
},
{
    1537.6,1540.88
     make it a little harder with more tension you can spread your feet out just a
},
{
    1540.88,1545.36
     little bit. Bend those knees to start off if you want and then kicking
},
{
    1545.36,1555.12
     those arms back. Ideally you want to get those elbows straight at the end, but if you just
},
{
    1555.12,1562.08
     feel comfortable maybe getting to here right now, that's okay. And then ideally you want
},
{
    1562.08,1570.44
     to eventually be able to get it nice and straight because I can really feel that in my triceps when I straighten those elbows all the way out.
},
{
    1570.44,1571.44
     So there you have it.
},
{
    1571.44,1574.6
     Those are my general stretches and exercises for the wrist and the hand.
},
{
    1574.6,1580.2
     So this was the seventh day of my 10 day whole body wellness challenge at the moderate level.
