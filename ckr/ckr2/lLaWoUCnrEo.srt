     In this video, I'm going to show an easy step-by-step guide on how to crack your big toe. Stay tuned.
},
{
    11.6,16.48
     Hey everyone, Dr. O here at SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. So if you feel like your big toe is
},
{
    16.48,22.32
     locked up, jammed up, just really tight and achy and needs a nice self-mobilization exercise put
},
{
    22.32,25.4
     into it, this is going to be a video that
},
{
    25.4,29.36
     you're not going to want in this. So we're going to focus on three big areas
},
{
    29.36,34.6
     where a lot of people get not only foot pain but that first toe pain. It's the
},
{
    34.6,39.68
     first joint right here, that distal joint of the first flange, the big toe.
},
{
    39.68,43.8
     You also have a second one that's a little bit below that. So when you do
},
{
    43.8,46.0
     this you can palpate it, feel the joint motions.
},
{
    46.0,48.0
     We're going to focus on this one, this one.
},
{
    48.0,53.0
     And then lastly, we're going to put a little bit more motion into this first metatarsal.
},
{
    53.0,58.0
     So to start with this first joint of the big toe, we're going to use a leverage exercise
},
{
    58.0,60.0
     to get that to self-release.
},
{
    60.0,64.0
     So what we want to do is take this part of the finger right here of that pointer finger
},
{
    64.0,68.08
     and place it right under the spot where that first toe moves.
},
{
    68.08,72.08
     Next we're going to take the thumb and at that point that's the movement.
},
{
    72.08,77.68
     We're going to pull down on the thumb while we lift up with the pointer finger right
},
{
    77.68,79.04
     into that joint.
},
{
    79.04,80.96
     So just kind of just like this.
},
{
    80.96,87.6
     And if this needs to be released you're probably going to get a loud pop crack, just a general
},
{
    87.6,90.44
     release due to the mobilization in there.
},
{
    90.44,91.44
     Don't try to force it.
},
{
    91.44,95.96
     And again, if you have any pain while doing this, discontinue immediately.
},
{
    95.96,100.92
     So for a better angle, what I'm doing again is putting my pointer finger right underneath
},
{
    100.92,103.0
     where that joint moves.
},
{
    103.0,105.0
     And then I'm going to take my thumb and place it right there,
},
{
    105.0,106.7
     and the movement, again, is lifting up
},
{
    106.7,108.1
     and then pulling back like this.
},
{
    108.1,110.66
     So here, let me do it on my thumb really quickly.
},
{
    110.66,112.46
     And I'm just kind of lifting up.
},
{
    112.46,114.7
     Actually, my thumb just popped right there,
},
{
    114.7,116.76
     and then that's the movement right there
},
{
    116.76,119.2
     that we're going to be doing into the toe.
},
{
    119.2,120.56
     So for this joint right here,
},
{
    120.56,122.76
     we're going to do something very similar.
},
{
    122.76,124.9
     Take that pointer finger,
},
{
    124.9,128.6
     place it right under where that joint starts, and then with this
},
{
    128.6,131.84
     one we're going to place our thumb right above that.
},
{
    131.84,138.28
     So we're really just isolating that second joint right there into the big toe.
},
{
    138.28,142.16
     But instead we're also going to put a little bit of dorsiflexion into there.
},
{
    142.16,145.36
     So I'm going to take my hand, I'm going to place it at the toe right here,
},
{
    145.36,147.48
     and I'm going to pull back on it
},
{
    147.48,150.32
     while I put pressure right here at the thumb inwards
},
{
    150.32,153.48
     in there while also doing that same movement.
},
{
    153.48,156.68
     So do that, and then I pull back onto the toe.
},
{
    156.68,158.64
     I hold this for a couple seconds,
},
{
    158.64,162.16
     I'm going to release it, and then I'm going to keep doing it.
},
{
    162.16,164.32
     And the odds are, again, if you feel like there's a,
},
{
    164.32,165.42
     if it's going to release,
},
{
    165.42,167.72
     you probably will get a pop or a crack into there,
},
{
    167.72,168.96
     but don't try to force it
},
{
    168.96,170.48
     and don't go to the point of pain.
},
{
    170.48,171.44
     So just keep doing it.
},
{
    171.44,173.12
     And what you're going to find is that it's going to put
},
{
    173.12,177.54
     a lot more mobility into that first digit.
},
{
    177.54,179.0
     So for the first metatarsal,
},
{
    179.0,181.44
     it's quite a long bone right here into the foot.
},
{
    181.44,182.72
     We're gonna start right here,
},
{
    182.72,184.6
     kind of right at the top of the ball of the foot,
},
{
    184.6,186.12
     and we're going to take our thumbs
},
{
    186.12,188.12
     and we're going to press into it.
},
{
    188.12,189.12
     Just trace down to it
},
{
    189.12,190.7
     and put a little bit of pressure in there.
},
{
    190.7,192.28
     If you have a dropped metatarsal,
},
{
    192.28,193.6
     this right here is going to help
},
{
    193.6,195.8
     put it back into better alignment.
},
{
    195.8,199.56
     You might feel a clunk, a click, pop, reset, you name it,
},
{
    199.56,203.72
     and hopefully it'll give you a nice amount of relief.
},
{
    203.72,205.92
     Just keep pressing in there for a couple seconds.
},
{
    205.92,210.94
     Just trace over the whole area and only go to your comfort level with it.
},
{
    210.94,214.52
     If you want to target more of the top right here where you feel it might have a little
},
{
    214.52,220.64
     bit more irritation across the top of the foot, it's a little bit easier to do this.
},
{
    220.64,224.04
     Grab onto the foot, clamp onto it, and then take your other hand.
},
{
    224.04,229.38
     What I do is I use the pad right there and then I'm going to press into it. It's kind of
},
{
    229.38,233.04
     like a shearing motion. So you can kind of see how I'm pressing down into the
},
{
    233.04,238.54
     foot. And this one for me really always gets my foot to release. So I'm attacking
},
{
    238.54,243.34
     that first metatarsal by just putting a lot of pressure into a nice shearing
},
{
    243.34,246.24
     motion with it. Again, hold for a couple seconds,
},
{
    246.24,249.32
     and at that point, if you feel a click, pop, whatever,
},
{
    249.32,251.0
     completely normal.
},
{
    251.0,253.6
     And with that, you're going to be able to target this joint,
},
{
    253.6,256.06
     that joint, and the first metatarsal very easily.
},
{
    256.06,258.28
     So give it a try, and I hope it gives you a lot of relief.
},
{
    258.28,260.24
