     Bob and Brad the two most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    9.0,12.72
     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist, Brad Heineck physical therapist, together
},
{
    12.72,15.98
     We are the most famous physical therapists on the internet, in our opinion of course Bob
},
{
    15.98,20.12
     Brad today we're gonna talk about you know why do my shoulder blades stick out not just me
},
{
    20.12,26.24
     But why maybe some people in the audience and what are you gonna do about it? That's called winging scapula
},
{
    26.24,31.1
     We're gonna show you ten exercises and stretches you can do and by the way
},
{
    31.1,36.04
     There's really two instances where this may happen one you may you may happen just on one side
},
{
    36.04,39.64
     Sure, and that's usually an injury or maybe a neurological event
},
{
    39.64,44.24
     I know because I had it happen to me right on my left side
},
{
    44.72,47.16
     I got an inflammation in there
},
{
    47.16,51.56
     They don't know what it was maybe a virus and it infected my long thoracic nerve
},
{
    51.56,60.26
     Okay, which affected my serratus anterior which is a muscle that helps hold the shoulder blade into the wall of the ribs
},
{
    60.26,63.26
     And just hold on because we're gonna show you a really good example
},
{
    63.96,67.22
     What's interesting with me though is that they both seem weak now
},
{
    67.22,71.66
     Right, but on this side I think it's scarred up and it's holding the scapula down
},
{
    71.66,74.14
     It's gone, I no longer have it
},
{
    74.28,76.28
     So in that case that you know
},
{
    76.38,81.06
     That's a whole different animal than what we're really talking about today Brad is more of a postural thing
},
{
    81.06,83.86
     Sure, if you have bad posture over time
},
{
    86.56,91.04
     of a postural thing, if you have bad posture over time your shoulder blades are going to start to wing out and it really starts to look unattractive after a while, because people don't realize,
},
{
    91.6,95.36
     you want to get in that position now Bob? Sure, but there are some people out there Bob that have
},
{
    95.36,99.92
     not seen us before before we show this anomaly, if you are new to our channel please take a second
},
{
    99.92,104.4
     to subscribe to us, we have a subscription button here or here, we provide videos on how to stay
},
{
    104.4,106.38
     healthy, fit, pain-free and we upload every day
},
{
    106.38,111.68
     Excellent. All right now here we go. This is it. This is like going to one of those circus shows
},
{
    111.68,116.7
     This is a freak show here. Yep freak show and I'm gonna pull this down
},
{
    117.04,118.44
     All right
},
{
    118.44,126.46
     So can you see that you can see a scapula is in there now that's when he's down there together now go up Bob once and see this
},
{
    126.46,129.72
     I can get my finger down in this scapula right here is way out
},
{
    130.24,132.12
     Can you see that Lonnie?
},
{
    132.12,136.88
     And then this one here is this bad one which is not near as far as this one
},
{
    136.88,138.88
     So I think again it's scarred down there
},
{
    138.88,141.92
     So if you can, Samiz I can put my whole hand
},
{
    141.92,143.6
     You're wearing me out here Brad
},
{
    143.6,146.12
     But that's a good gap of a winging scapula
},
{
    146.12,150.08
     So and you know my my scapula isn't bad standing here though is it Brad?
},
{
    150.08,153.56
     Right because I have worked on these. Yeah here he's pretty flat across
},
{
    153.96,158.92
     But it's bad. It is an exercise I need to throw in there. Yeah, scapula exercises
},
{
    159.8,163.52
     All right, the first thing we're gonna do is gonna do you want to do it again
},
{
    163.52,167.14
     It's a postural thing you want to do some stretches so you can take a foam roller
},
{
    167.92,172.76
     Or if you don't have a foam roller you can take a rolled up sheet and towel or whatever
},
{
    172.76,176.36
     So here we have a towel that we rolled up and we taped it with some red duct tape
},
{
    176.36,181.08
     And we're gonna use that and you can just lay on it and put a pillow behind your head, Brad
},
{
    181.08,182.6
     Sure
},
{
    182.6,186.48
     And you get it right between the shoulder blades and this is a
},
{
    186.48,190.48
     postural thing, we're just gonna use gravity with some support right down the
},
{
    190.48,194.96
     center of the spine and the thoracic spine and we're just gonna lay there like
},
{
    194.96,201.16
     this, and you'll see this works but I just got a nice cavitation
},
{
    201.16,206.62
     cracked my back Bob, but if you want to get a 36 inch full roller, this is going to work better
},
{
    206.62,208.62
     This is deluxe
},
{
    209.72,215.2
     Now the whole thing with posture a lot of times what happens is your shoulder blades start to internally rotate and
},
{
    215.6,218.52
     This all tightens up on you, so with this knob
},
{
    218.6,223.24
     Rad not only stretches the chest, but it's also bringing the arms out into external rotation
},
{
    223.24,225.6
     So here getting a stretch. It's
},
{
    225.6,230.64
     getting a good stretch. So this goes right from my sacrum all the way up my spine to my head so
},
{
    230.64,236.96
     everything is a nice alignment, gravity is gently pulling it there and I'm comfortable. Yeah so this
},
{
    236.96,241.84
     is the lazy man's way to good posture because it's just stretching without working at all. Sure and
},
{
    241.84,247.14
     one little hint if you do want to do with this get a foam roller that has a lower density
},
{
    247.14,250.08
     It's a little bit soft. They make them hard not as comfortable
},
{
    250.32,254.26
     All right, the other one I like Brad is just even doing the ball in a chair
},
{
    255.06,257.82
     So if you got a chair you get one of these little
},
{
    258.38,262.58
     Rubber balls you can get it from one of the big box stores. It's a kick ball
},
{
    262.58,265.2
     You know what, it got some give you, you're not gonna do with a basketball
},
{
    266.08,269.52
     Again, it's a great way to get a good stretch over the chair
},
{
    269.52,272.8
     This is the easy one to do you can do some stretches like this
},
{
    272.8,276.44
     You're stretching the mid-back, you're stretching the shoulders, you're stretching the chest
},
{
    276.44,281.76
     So if I wanted to give a little extra we could do this and it's comfortable because the ball is soft and squishy
},
{
    281.76,288.42
     It's good for people who have that mid-back pain too because you can do some of these Hallelujah stretches. There you go.
},
{
    288.92,292.28
     Stretching out like that. You don't have to go to church that Sunday do a few of those.
},
{
    292.28,295.78
     If you don't have any tools at all Brad or anything like this
},
{
    295.78,302.76
     You can just go on a doorway put your arms on both sides of the doorway like this and just lean in and that's gonna stretch the chest too
},
{
    302.76,305.46
     You can do it at different levels, you can do it up here
},
{
    306.94,312.32
     here and even down here stretching into the doorway, hands on the sides, if it's at work in their commercial doorways
},
{
    312.32,317.62
     Sometimes they're too wide, they won't work if they're too wide, it's got to be kind of a 30 second, you've got a wingspan like me
},
{
    317.62,321.22
     Right if you're six and a half foot tall, that's all, all right next one
},
{
    321.82,325.2
     Let's do a couple of ones with just some exercise band Brad
},
{
    325.84,327.84
     That's fine
},
{
    327.88,331.88
     Well, you can't use it. Oh you want to use the other one? No, where's the other one? Oh there it is right there
},
{
    331.88,336.92
     Oh good got me going there. No I got I'm gonna need to take that one. No you can have mine Bob
},
{
    336.92,341.68
     Let me do this one because there's less handle on there. All right. All right one easy one to do
},
{
    341.68,343.68
     Are you okay Lonnie? You got me all?
},
{
    344.12,349.52
     Is to go ahead and take some stretch tubing or stretch band you start with your arms in front of you
},
{
    349.92,354.98
     And thumbs down like this and then you're gonna move your thumbs up like this and you're going back like this
},
{
    355.06,359.42
     So what you're doing is you're squeezing the shoulder blades together while you're doing it
},
{
    359.92,363.26
     So I'm going like this and I'm pulling those shoulder blades together
},
{
    363.52,367.26
     But at the same time I'm getting some external rotation. Do you see that Brad?
},
{
    367.26,371.96
     So the palm is down and he's doing this. Yeah, so I'm going up at the same time so
},
{
    372.52,378.24
     Thumbs toward each other now thumbs up. It's kind of like you're doing the hitchhiker. Yep thumbs towards each other
},
{
    378.24,382.56
     Now thumbs up. Here just wait Bob. This is driving me nuts. Here do it like this
},
{
    383.72,389.18
     Like that and hold it there. Now show them with that hand. Okay now watch right here
},
{
    390.44,392.84
     There it's how it goes flat there you go
},
{
    392.84,394.52
     You don't have things flying all over the place
},
{
    394.52,400.52
     And then the next one you can do is just do one overhead brad where you put both hands together up here like this
},
{
    400.76,408.34
     I'll sit down. Yeah, you're gonna be over the camera. So I'm going like this and I'm just pulling them apart and pulling my shoulder blades again
},
{
    409.22,411.22
     together
},
{
    411.48,416.32
     And you know from this side you can't see it, but his shoulder blades are coming back. I'm gonna
},
{
    418.68,422.88
     So they're coming here and in my hands are and that's all
},
{
    423.32,427.6
     Not all but a vast majority of that is that middle and lower trap
},
{
    428.56,432.88
     Now we got again the rhombois we got the upper trap middle trap lower trap we got the
},
{
    432.88,436.4
     levator scapulae we're trying to impress people it's serratus anterior don't forget that
},
{
    436.4,445.56
     serratus anterior yep all right then we can do um actually some um if you want to maybe be my wall, I'll be your wall, okay, I'm gonna hold
},
{
    451.32,456.4
     Trust, trust, trust, yeah, that's why I got a knob at home to work on Yeah, and you want to have some way to hook the band to the wall here and someday you're gonna find one but
},
{
    457.4,462.8
     What I like about this I just go around the bed post Brad, and we go I work some this way
},
{
    462.8,465.32
     My hand is a bed post, yeah, I work some this way, my hand is a bed post, yep I work some this way
},
{
    465.92,470.94
     So I'm going up my arms going again an external rotation. I go down a little bit lower just straight back
},
{
    472.44,474.9
     And I do lots of these my wife does these too
},
{
    474.9,480.96
     She just has one of these hooked up in the window actually, one of those door holders and she closes the window on it
},
{
    480.96,482.96
     It'd be nice to have someone who could hook these up too
},
{
    482.96,489.4
     Yeah, and she does you know should just go and do these every so often throughout the day because it's such a good postural one
},
{
    489.4,496.4
     And then the last one is doing like this, and you can do a set of 50, I mean eventually work up to it
},
{
    496.68,500.12
     It's kind of like doing setups for the shoulder blades, it's that core
},
{
    500.68,502.68
     Yep
},
{
    502.68,504.44
     That's right Brad
},
{
    504.44,505.0
     All right another one Brad Yeah, that's right Brad.
},
{
    505.0,510.72
     All right another one Brad we're actually going to just work on this is one that you can do you can start without weights so you can
},
{
    512.08,516.24
     Eventually work to the point where you use weights maybe a rolled towel
},
{
    517.8,522.96
     This would work. There you go. So you're gonna start and you can go in different positions here
},
{
    522.96,528.58
     You can start off you can go into the Y position with the palms down. I'm gonna give you a little more room Bob. Thank you
},
{
    529.92,533.12
     Palms down you can also do thumbs up
},
{
    534.28,539.04
     Now I'm going into the what the field goal position Brad. He's like this right now. Can you see that Lonnie?
},
{
    539.4,543.48
     He's doing this. Again, I'm doing thumbs up or palms down
},
{
    544.48,546.72
     And then I can do the reverse Y
},
{
    548.08,553.68
     Palms are down on this one. You don't do palms up or thumb up on this one.
},
{
    554.4,560.0
     For those extra flexible people that covers that lower trap, middle trap and a little bit of upper trap as well
},
{
    560.0,562.0
     So you're getting that full
},
{
    562.4,568.3
     Supportive strength on that scapular region. Yeah, and you can do it just with even like soup cans then start adding
},
{
    568.3,570.0
     You know
},
{
    570.0,576.06
     If you don't have dumbbells, soup cans, weight is weight. So the last two Brad are the ones that I need to do
},
{
    576.06,582.48
     The ones for the serratus anterior. Yeah, the old serratus. You can start off with you want to straighten this out Brad. That way?
},
{
    583.24,585.16
     No, that way. there we go just like that
},
{
    586.08,589.24
     So this is the one that was making mine stick out
},
{
    589.36,595.42
     Yeah, so these are the ones I need to do you can start just prone you know in the quadruped position as they call it
},
{
    595.42,599.42
     The elbows are straight that's the whole key here and I'm going up here
},
{
    599.42,603.86
     And then I'm squeezing my shoulder blades together trying to break them down. How are they when I do this one Brad?
},
{
    603.86,605.34
     They're not so bad now
},
{
    605.34,609.0
     He's going up and he flattens right off against the rib cage and here they come back together
},
{
    609.36,613.96
     Right one's still higher obviously, but not like at the beginning of the video
},
{
    613.96,616.88
     So then I go to this one and this is the one I need to, well
},
{
    616.88,618.72
     I probably need to do these first for a while
},
{
    618.72,620.96
     They build up and then I got to go into this one
},
{
    620.96,632.32
     The GI push-up one and this is the one where I can't get them down Yeah, I can't that's quite a wing Bob you could fly away like an angel Bob
},
{
    632.8,637.78
     You must be turning into an angel. That's right. That's my problem. I'm sure you're away for free with that one
},
{
    638.32,645.6
     All right folks now I'm all world. Yeah, I remember Brad. We're not just pretty, we're pretty ugly, we're pretty helpful
},
{
    645.6,651.0
     Yeah, don't forget that we're gonna help you out. Yeah, we're handy. Just give us some duct tape when we can fix anything
},
{
    651.0,653.0
     Even a broken heart. Thanks
},
