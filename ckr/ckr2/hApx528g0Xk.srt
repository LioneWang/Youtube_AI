     Alright, so this is one of our functional taping for musculoskeletal injury tape jobs
},
{
    7.44,10.68
     associated with like a gamekeeper thumb or thumb instability.
},
{
    10.68,13.8
     I like to call it soft tissue thumb.
},
{
    13.8,17.24
     So what we're going to do is measure from the inside of the thumb around the phenar
},
{
    17.24,23.64
     eminence and it's going to wrap around almost like a fascia line around the arm.
},
{
    23.64,26.0
     We're going to use, that's going to be our measurement.
},
{
    26.0,28.0
     What we're going to do is cut that tape
},
{
    29.0,31.0
     into two one-inch strips.
},
{
    42.0,44.0
     Now we'll start by breaking a one-inch box.
},
{
    44.0,51.0
     Now we'll start by breaking a one inch box. And we're just going to apply that tape gently with no stretch.
},
{
    51.0,56.0
     Come around the inside of that thumb.
},
{
    56.0,59.0
     And now we're going to block the tape so that we don't create any numbness.
},
{
    59.0,62.0
     And the patient usually tells us exactly where that weakness is.
},
{
    62.0,66.4
     So you can see on our dock right here, if I push in, I'm actually relocating that joint.
},
{
    66.4,69.9
     So I'm gonna apply a heavy stretch right over that.
},
{
    69.9,72.9
     And then it's just paper off tension.
},
{
    75.7,78.2
     The rest of the way, almost like just allowing the tape
},
{
    78.2,80.54
     to fall down in a spiral line.
},
{
    80.54,83.24
     Now, we're gonna do that with a second strip
},
{
    83.24,85.34
     to add a little extra stability.
},
{
    87.34,87.5
     Once again,
},
{
    89.5,91.06
     applying that tape.
},
{
    96.22,96.58
     Now you'll notice I try and stay off the phenol eminence as much as I possibly can so if they're washing their hands
},
{
    115.56,118.2
     we're going to be able to prevent this from falling off too easily. Now, once we have that tape on, this might be all the patient needs. This might give us more than enough stability to actually take the job.
},
{
    118.2,122.2
     However, if they're saying, yeah, that feels pretty good, but we want to actually get a
},
{
    122.2,153.64
     little bit more out of it. We can use one inch And we're just going to follow that right around.
},
{
    153.64,156.92
     So now that, every single time she uses that thumb, she's going to notice it's going to
},
{
    156.92,161.88
     block the translation of that joint into instability.
},
{
    161.88,167.12
     And it's going to give you a lot more support as you're going through all of your soft tissue work or just generally at night because one of
},
{
    167.12,170.2
     the things that you have a problem with when this type of an injury sometimes
},
{
    170.2,172.94
     just sleeping at night creates pain because what we'll do is we'll curl up
},
{
    172.94,176.72
     or put our thumb in a bad position and create strain on it. So this is a nice
},
{
    176.72,180.52
     tape job for either sleeping or for myself in particular I'll actually wear
},
{
    180.52,183.22
     this if my thumb's bothering me a little bit during some soft tissue
},
{
    183.22,190.56
     treatments. So again we use this for thumb instability at the carpal metacarpal joint or at the metacarpal
},
{
    190.56,191.2
     phyllangial joint.
},
