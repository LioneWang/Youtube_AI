     Bob and Brad, the two most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    9.12,13.6
     Alright, hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist, Brad Heineck physical therapist,
},
{
    13.6,16.96
     we're the most famous physical therapists on the internet, in our opinion of course Bob,
},
{
    16.96,23.12
     the one stretch that could stop your neck, upper back and shoulder pain, quite a miracle here Brad
},
{
    23.12,26.88
     Say no more Bob, Bob you know we've been doing this we got over 50
},
{
    26.88,31.04
     years in the clinic work with thousands of patients. I thought you were going to say we've been
},
{
    31.04,38.0
     videotaping for over 50 years. Well seems like it seems like that to them I bet. Yeah we're putting
},
{
    38.0,45.36
     them through another torture series of videos. But anyways I'm sure you agree with this stretch is probably
},
{
    51.32,57.34
     Has gave us more success with shoulder neck and upper back pain than anything else. That's right If you're gonna pick one stretch, this is it. It might it may not work, but it's the one that's gonna most likely work
},
{
    57.34,63.4
     Right and it has other benefits as well, but yeah if you did join us for one of these torture sessions
},
{
    63.4,70.5
     We'd be ashamed on you But you might as well subscribe to us now because we provide videos on how to stay healthy fit pain-free
},
{
    70.82,76.92
     And we upload every day also go even further yet and go over to Facebook and like us because Brad and I as
},
{
    77.32,81.62
     Children were not liked it was a torture session as children
},
{
    81.62,83.62
     Let's go on with the video
},
{
    83.62,85.0
     Alright session as children. Let's go on with the video.
},
{
    85.0,90.72
     We got here, we got to get Sam out, our new skeleton. Sam the new skeleton from 3B anatomical.
},
{
    90.72,97.28
     Okay so here we go we're looking at people that have a pain pattern right
},
{
    97.28,101.8
     behind Gumby, not that you have a Gumby on your shoulder but you can imagine
},
{
    101.8,108.4
     that for a little remembering. So Gumby was on my shoulder, he's hard to get out of there
},
{
    108.4,112.24
     We're looking at everything behind, right so kind of the low neck
},
{
    112.76,116.72
     the shoulder a lot of times in the shoulder blade or just down in the
},
{
    117.32,123.24
     In between the shoulder blades, a lot of times I have patients that I've had this too where they say you know it feels like
},
{
    124.44,128.48
     Tingling, right at the low low. They get weird sensations right there
},
{
    128.48,134.42
     And this is a good exercise if that because that's kind of a precursor to the worst things coming up
},
{
    134.42,138.64
     If you continue with your poor habits and or even a tight feeling
},
{
    138.72,143.68
     Yeah, if you get a tight feeling there that's usually like you said a precursor to pain pain is common
},
{
    143.68,145.92
     So the whole the whole thing is we got
},
{
    146.12,149.38
     Referred pain from the low neck. Yeah, okay
},
{
    149.38,154.8
     One area that if you have pain here in the shoulder that's related to reaching overhead
},
{
    155.24,159.68
     This exercise probably is not gonna work if you have pain in the front of the shoulder
},
{
    160.52,164.32
     Then it's probably not we're talking about back here, which is quite a bit
},
{
    164.32,167.64
     I mean you can have neck pain that goes down the arm
},
{
    169.0,171.0
     Generally that's not gonna make it
},
{
    171.16,175.56
     The arm pain is not gonna get worse when you lift the arm and put some resistance against it
},
{
    175.56,180.24
     So again, so we're kind of limited today. We'll talk about pain that's coming from the neck
},
{
    181.36,188.32
     Shoulder blade and in between the shoulders. One little screen test that I use with my patients
},
{
    191.28,198.32
     is I say sit down and can you look back like this and if they do this they sit down and they go
},
{
    198.88,204.4
     oh it kind of hurts as soon as they start going back it's like I'm almost 100% certain
},
{
    204.48,204.72
     As soon as they start going back, it's like I'm almost 100% certain
},
{
    208.12,208.64
     You know this pain over here is probably from that much
},
{
    209.48,215.76
     Same with me I often see the correlation that they might have decent motion other ways, but as soon as they try to go back
},
{
    216.12,218.96
     It's limited, and that there's your sign
},
{
    218.96,224.64
     There's a good sign that there's possibly a neck problem and that it may be causing the pain going down it further
},
{
    224.64,229.58
     Precisely, so we want to regain that motion, I mean that's one of the
},
{
    229.58,233.98
     generally the cardinal principles of being a therapist, it's lacking motion
},
{
    233.98,239.98
     you regain the motion and a lot of times the pain will coincide with it
},
{
    239.98,244.96
     Okay so this stretch we're going to show some variations, it's one stretch but
},
{
    244.96,245.84
     it's variations but all of them you're going to show some variations. It's one stretch but it's variations
},
{
    245.84,249.64
     But all of them you're going to start to stretch you can start with some chin tucks
},
{
    250.0,256.36
     And the chin tucks besides warming it up a little bit is just getting you into the right position
},
{
    256.88,260.84
     The starting position. So I don't really consider it an exercise yet
},
{
    260.92,266.44
     This is just warming up and then we'll go into the real exercise which is extension. Okay, Bob
},
{
    267.08,272.28
     Why don't you do this one? Yeah show your version and I'll show the one I offer
},
{
    272.28,278.1
     I do yours first because yours is easier. Okay, just take a towel roll. I got a towel roll
},
{
    278.1,280.1
     I taped it and
},
{
    280.52,285.14
     Go around low on the neck not up here, but down low on the neck
},
{
    285.14,289.3
     You're gonna have good posture. Yeah, good body posture
},
{
    289.3,294.36
     And you need a chair that doesn't go too high this one goes right about my shoulder blade level
},
{
    294.54,298.56
     You can go a little higher than that. Where's yours go to Bob? Oh, you don't have a back
},
{
    300.04,306.36
     So but if you've got a tall chair that comes up here, I don't have a spine Brad. I didn't say anything.
},
{
    306.36,308.0
     All right keep going keep going.
},
{
    308.0,312.16
     So you need a chair that is mid-back at the highest you know this one
},
{
    312.16,316.8
     I really like this kind that rotates like this. It just is more comfortable.
},
{
    317.08,321.32
     We don't like the chair for sitting in it. We like it for exercising in it.
},
{
    321.64,328.0
     Okay, so here we go. we're gonna do the chin tuck and normally if this hurts a little bit
},
{
    328.28,330.48
     Put some support and you can get back farther
},
{
    330.88,335.44
     If you're feeling better and then you just start working your neck extensives gently
},
{
    336.44,340.24
     And typically what's gonna happen is you're gonna be going back further
},
{
    340.88,346.24
     With less pain and the pain in the mid-back or the shoulder will move
},
{
    346.24,348.24
     Can you show Bob?
},
{
    348.24,352.96
     We're trying to look for here what Brad's trying to say is this pain should start to feel better
},
{
    353.28,358.22
     The further pain that's further out it might get even a little worse up here
},
{
    358.44,359.92
     That's a good sign
},
{
    359.92,364.16
     A bad sign is if it kind of goes away in the neck and gets worse in this area
},
{
    364.16,370.86
     The further the pain travels out the worse it's getting so we're trying to start getting it to clear you know go down in that area
},
{
    370.86,377.76
     And so and this is I've found many times about people start doing this and oh it still hurts
},
{
    377.76,382.28
     But the it feels better with this but with some repetition and not getting too aggressive
},
{
    382.84,385.56
     Kind of work with it gently and give it some repetitions
},
{
    385.56,387.56
     You know five to ten I'm not talking
},
{
    387.56,390.04
     The idea here is that you don't try to do
},
{
    390.8,391.64
     50 of them
},
{
    391.64,397.54
     What you do is like do ten and then an hour later do another ten and do this throughout the day
},
{
    397.54,402.88
     That's where you're gonna get good results if you just try to say okay, I did my exercise once a day
},
{
    403.0,409.7
     No, that's not gonna do it at all You've got to do it five to maybe eight times a day and then you're gonna start getting some results
},
{
    410.0,413.4
     The other thing I was gonna point out Brad, when you're doing that exercise
},
{
    413.4,417.68
     What I see quite often on people when they go back they often tilt one way or the other
},
{
    418.2,421.36
     And the only way to you know if you do it looking in a mirror
},
{
    421.36,425.04
     You can see if you're doing that because generally some people are kind of
},
{
    430.94,432.96
     Drifting away from the painful side, so you want to keep your head straight if you can and start working it straight back
},
{
    434.96,436.4
     Because they don't know they're doing it
},
{
    442.44,446.1
     And as you progress with this what I'll have people do is start to go back like this and you know This is when you get to this point you're feeling pretty good overall
},
{
    446.1,448.1
     You're making good progress
},
{
    448.34,452.04
     Bob then eventually you want to get away from the towel itself
},
{
    452.04,458.24
     But right another way to do it is to if you want to kind of try to get work on specific levels of the neck
},
{
    458.24,460.24
     Yep, you can use just this
},
{
    460.28,461.44
     Selfage
},
{
    461.44,463.12
     Selfage, yeah
},
{
    463.12,468.18
     The little ridge on the edge of the towel. So we're gonna go up like this
},
{
    468.18,471.78
     You got to kind of bring it up like this otherwise it gets caught on your shoulders
},
{
    471.78,475.94
     And now I'm you know I a lot of times tell people to make bunny ears
},
{
    475.94,477.32
     So they watch the bunny ears
},
{
    477.32,480.78
     So I'm right below my ears right now as far as the the selfish
},
{
    480.88,484.82
     But I can go a little bit lower and I can go even lower yet
},
{
    484.82,488.92
     I can go like this so I can get different levels I keep the bunny ears up by my eyes
},
{
    488.92,495.08
     and now I'm gonna go back and my arms my eyes follow the bunny ears the bunny
},
{
    495.08,499.2
     ears follow me so we're moving right along at the same time.
},
{
    499.2,503.68
     Here, try the chair Bob, I want you to try that.
},
{
    504.12,510.1
     Brad that's very kind of you, I'll have to see if this works here. I never really use this type of chair
},
{
    510.1,514.96
     Oh, I didn't either. It was an accident one day. I was in there and I used it and it's like
},
{
    515.76,517.76
     You know, he's right. You know that?
},
{
    517.76,524.44
     It goes with the back. It's working a little bit on that mid-back too. I think that's what it's doing.
},
{
    524.44,525.48
     You get the full stretch
},
{
    525.84,531.92
     So yeah, this is another alternative. I mean if you can go back without the towel, go ahead
},
{
    531.92,537.68
     If you're able to stretch it and not really it doesn't make things worse actually makes things feel a little bit better
},
{
    537.84,543.36
     Don't use the towel. I've done it without the towel and I use my hands and just go back here and
},
{
    544.12,549.98
     Do that and then you can kind of massage those muscles. Have you done that Bob? I have not. No, that's a good idea
},
{
    550.28,553.38
     Yeah, try it. Yeah, do you want to show that strap? Yeah
},
{
    554.24,557.52
     Yeah, I would grab right here and because you can get
},
{
    558.0,569.12
     Specific on the levels if you got a stretch out strap these work really well because they're narrow and they Particularly if you have arthritis or you have a hard time grabbing onto the towel
},
{
    569.12,576.62
     These have loops every six inches or so, but because they're so narrow too you can really get again get on specific levels
},
{
    576.62,582.32
     When Bob's talking level we're talking the vertebra, C7, C6
},
{
    582.32,588.48
     And then we go back here and if we do that again you might keep it up by the eyes
},
{
    588.48,595.24
     and that's often a great place to put it. You can also just put it down like this right here and hold it.
},
{
    595.24,603.16
     Again you do what makes it feel better this should make things feel better not worse it's not a no pain no gain stretch
},
{
    603.16,605.6
     it's a as it do it things clearly get better
},
{
    605.96,610.46
     Shoulder and the back feel better and it works up to the pain like Bob mentioned the centralizing
},
{
    611.52,614.34
     aspect of the stretch. So now we're keeping things real simple here
},
{
    614.34,619.72
     It's not hard to do and you know give it a try if it doesn't help we have some more advanced stretches
},
{
    619.72,623.12
     You can try but this is gonna help a lot of people. I mean this is gonna help
},
{
    627.68,630.48
     But this is gonna help a lot of people. So once again Bob just another tool of the kid But we're still working on that big tool to fix the
},
{
    631.2,637.48
     You are big tool. By the way we can fix just about anything except for the broken heart, but we're working on it
},
