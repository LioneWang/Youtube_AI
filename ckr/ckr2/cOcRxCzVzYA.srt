     Bob and Brad, the two most famous physical therapists
},
{
    6.72,8.04
     on the internet.
},
{
    11.04,13.04
     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.
},
{
    13.04,14.56
     Brad, I'm the physical therapist.
},
{
    14.56,16.4
     I'm the most famous physical therapist on the internet.
},
{
    16.4,17.24
     Why, Bob?
},
{
    17.24,18.64
     Why, in our opinion, of course.
},
{
    18.64,19.48
     I need your heart rate, Bob.
},
{
    19.48,20.32
     I'm glad I'm there, too.
},
{
    20.32,21.64
     Right on the patella.

     Short version of us, go to Twitter, Instagram or TikTok.
},
{
    57.72,58.56
     There you go, Bob.
},
{
    58.56,59.6
     All right, let's go to work, Brad.
},
{
    59.6,60.44
     That's right.
},
{
    60.44,62.96
     Okay, wrist pain.
},
{
    62.96,64.88
     You know, it's one of those things
},
{
    64.88,67.76
     that you're probably gonna have wrist pain sooner or later,
},
{
    67.76,70.38
     whether you're an active person and overuse your wrist,
},
{
    70.38,73.44
     or just as the aging process goes along.
},
{
    73.44,76.82
     And the reason is we're gonna look right away to Sam.
},
{
    76.82,78.88
     Sam, I am.
},
{
    78.88,80.96
     He's our skeleton.
},
{
    80.96,84.56
     But we look at the anatomy of the wrist,
},
{
    84.56,88.34
     and you'll see there's a lot of little bones.
},
{
    88.34,89.38
     There's eight of them actually.
},
{
    89.38,91.34
     I'm not gonna go through all the names of them.
},
{
    91.34,94.16
     But they're there and they're all there for a good reason.
},
{
    94.16,96.48
     They all have joint surfaces on them.
},
{
    96.48,99.04
     They have cartilage and they're snowvial fluid.
},
{
    99.04,102.84
     And they allow the wrist to flex, to extend,
},
{
    102.84,106.92
     to ulnar DVA, radial deviate, and make circles.
},
{
    106.92,108.48
     It's a complicated joint.
},
{
    108.48,110.44
     It really does a lot of motion.
},
{
    110.44,111.28
     It does.
},
{
    111.28,113.76
     It's gotta be stable, but yet it has to move too.
},
{
    113.76,116.72
     So that's always a tricky proposition.
},
{
    116.72,117.56
     Right.
},
{
    117.56,119.6
     Again, you got a lot of joints there.
},
{
    119.6,120.44
     Exactly.
},
{
    120.44,122.0
     If you think about all the times
},
{
    122.0,123.64
     when you open and close the doors,
},
{
    123.64,124.8
     if you're doing some manual work,
},
{
    124.8,125.78
     you're pushing, you're pushing,
},
{
    125.78,128.88
     you're pulling, and it's really, that joint,
},
{
    128.88,132.16
     you know, all those bones are really going to work.
},
{
    132.16,133.0
     A lot of work.
},
{
    133.0,134.04
     A lot of abuse.
},
{
    134.04,137.86
     So what happens is, you know, you can have some swelling
},
{
    137.86,140.48
     in there and a little bit of swelling in each joint
},
{
    140.48,144.52
     adds up to a lot of pain, lot of loss or range of motion,
},
{
    144.52,147.84
     a good place for arthritis to set in,
},
{
    147.84,151.12
     as you get into your 50s and 60s, et cetera.
},
{
    151.12,152.74
     So how do you get rid of it?
},
{
    152.74,155.52
     We need to increase the range of motion.
},
{
    155.52,156.54
     Right.
},
{
    156.54,157.68
     Not only increase it,
},
{
    157.68,161.2
     but just by doing range of motion without stress on it,
},
{
    161.2,163.52
     it increases what is called synovial fluid.
},
{
    163.52,166.72
     It's almost like a motor oil for the joint.
},
{
    166.72,168.72
     So a natural motor oil.
},
{
    168.72,169.72
     Right.
},
{
    169.72,171.28
     There's one thing we do wanna mention.
},
{
    171.28,174.92
     If you have success with your wrist pain
},
{
    174.92,177.68
     and range of motion, like after you take a shower
},
{
    177.68,180.64
     or in a bath or if you're washing dishes in warm water
},
{
    180.64,184.28
     and it consistently feels better, loosens up, feels good,
},
{
    184.28,185.48
     there's an option that even one step above warm water and it consistently feels better, loosens up, feels good.
},
{
    188.34,189.88
     There's an option that even one step above that would be superficial heat,
},
{
    189.88,192.6
     water or a typical hot pack,
},
{
    192.6,196.16
     but they make hot packs like this, Thermotex.
},
{
    196.16,198.36
     It's a Thermotex infrared,
},
{
    198.36,201.08
     fire infrared heating system.
},
{
    201.08,203.64
     And we, Brad and I, you know,
},
{
    203.64,207.28
     you have one in your house, I have one in my house, the one I use actually,
},
{
    207.28,210.6
     and I just keep it in my chair all the time for my back.
},
{
    210.6,213.32
     It's just a great treatment for my back all night.
},
{
    213.32,215.56
     I'm getting off tangent here,
},
{
    215.56,219.26
     but the thing about far infrared heat,
},
{
    219.26,222.14
     it penetrates much deeper than normal heat.
},
{
    222.14,223.48
     Right, right.
},
{
    223.48,225.56
     Normal heating pad will just go, as far as we have marked here, just a few millimeters,. Right, right. So a normal heating pad will just go,
},
{
    225.56,226.8
     as far as we have marked here,
},
{
    226.8,229.32
     just a few millimeters, skin deep, essentially.
},
{
    229.32,230.32
     Right.
},
{
    230.32,231.92
     Thermotext, the fire and fret,
},
{
    231.92,233.66
     if you look at the yellow tape on the rule,
},
{
    233.66,236.94
     they're 2.36 inches, it's that deep.
},
{
    236.94,239.36
     Now, if you consider that on your wrist,
},
{
    239.36,241.56
     that's gonna heat not only your skin,
},
{
    241.56,243.2
     but all the way through the whole joint.
},
{
    243.2,244.28
     Right, exactly.
},
{
    244.28,248.84
     So it's gonna really provide increased blood flow,
},
{
    248.84,251.56
     which always helps heal or feel better.
},
{
    251.56,253.56
     Right, and it's not an aggressive heat.
},
{
    253.56,256.8
     It gets up to about 104 degrees Fahrenheit.
},
{
    256.8,259.66
     And the nice thing about, they make one just for the wrist,
},
{
    259.66,261.12
     but I don't see any sense in doing that
},
{
    261.12,264.68
     because this one wraps up just like one of those-
},
{
    264.68,265.52
     A muff. Yeah, there you go. Yeah. Had one wraps up just like one of those- A moth.
},
{
    265.52,266.64
     Yeah, there you go.
},
{
    266.64,268.68
     Had one, well, I didn't, my sister had one.
},
{
    268.68,269.76
     Boys didn't worm when I was a kid.
},
{
    269.76,270.6
     That's right.
},
{
    270.6,271.56
     And you put your hands in here
},
{
    271.56,273.44
     and you give both wrists at once.
},
{
    273.44,275.94
     And not only that, then you have the full,
},
{
    278.2,280.84
     the full pad for your knee, your hip, your back.
},
{
    280.84,284.16
     Right, it's just a great thing.
},
{
    284.16,286.0
     We need a portable battery so you can use it in deer hunting, right? Ooh. So you can keep your back. You know, it's just a great thing. We need a portable battery so you can use it
},
{
    286.0,287.04
     in deer hunting, right?
},
{
    287.04,288.56
     So you can keep your hands warm.
},
{
    288.56,290.0
     Well, yeah, it's not far away.
},
{
    290.0,292.4
     And then you can disconnect the cord.
},
{
    292.4,293.24
     That's a nice thing.
},
{
    293.24,295.88
     But anyways, let's go to the exercises Bob.
},
{
    295.88,297.8
     Cause if heat's not, you know,
},
{
    297.8,301.2
     it doesn't seem to change the pain or increase it.
},
{
    301.2,303.3
     Or this, even if you do heat it up,
},
{
    303.3,308.76
     you still want to do the exercises actually. So the first one, now these are relatively simple.
},
{
    308.76,310.12
     We've got some tricky ones at the end
},
{
    310.12,312.72
     that are going to be some nice pearls,
},
{
    312.72,314.02
     if you will, to get you going.
},
{
    314.02,318.48
     But just simply extend the wrist and flex it.
},
{
    318.48,320.76
     And just work it back and forth.
},
{
    320.76,323.6
     It starts out slow, if it's tight one direction,
},
{
    323.6,326.64
     go, I say it hurts and it's tight this way.
},
{
    326.64,328.06
     Don't push it.
},
{
    328.06,330.7
     Just kind of work into it back and forth.
},
{
    330.7,333.08
     And after about 10 repetitions,
},
{
    333.08,334.22
     and it starts to loosen up,
},
{
    334.22,337.2
     then you can give it a little over pressure each time.
},
{
    337.2,339.2
     As long as it doesn't increase your pain.
},
{
    339.2,340.04
     Right.
},
{
    340.04,342.64
     If you do it each time when the pain gets better,
},
{
    342.64,345.28
     clearly improves, then you can go a little bit,
},
{
    345.28,346.2
     but use good judgment.
},
{
    346.2,348.04
     Some people will do it off the edge of a table.
},
{
    348.04,348.88
     Sure, yep.
},
{
    348.88,350.72
     So you can, you know, you can support the forearm.
},
{
    350.72,351.56
     Right.
},
{
    351.56,354.92
     And yeah, kind of a little pressure on, pressure off,
},
{
    354.92,356.96
     pressure on, pressure off.
},
{
    356.96,359.0
     I heard one instructor say,
},
{
    359.0,360.84
     don't enter the pain cave.
},
{
    360.84,361.68
     Oh.
},
{
    361.68,362.52
     Stay on the pain cave.
},
{
    362.52,364.04
     That's a good way to think about it.
},
{
    364.04,366.64
     You know, along with wrist, if you got wrist,
},
{
    366.64,368.36
     your fingers are probably a little tight.
},
{
    368.36,369.84
     You may wanna work that.
},
{
    369.84,371.8
     I know personally in my experience,
},
{
    371.8,372.8
     that's what I need to do.
},
{
    372.8,375.88
     But then the next thing you wanna do is circles.
},
{
    375.88,376.72
     Sure.
},
{
    376.72,378.32
     Not a tight fist, but a loose fist.
},
{
    378.32,380.84
     And you could do it straight or with a fist,
},
{
    380.84,382.4
     whatever works better.
},
{
    382.4,385.8
     And you go clockwise, start out small,
},
{
    385.8,390.2
     and as it feels better, work bigger and bigger.
},
{
    390.2,392.12
     Make sure you go both directions.
},
{
    392.12,393.76
     You know, 10, 15 repetitions.
},
{
    393.76,394.92
     I always liked that one, Brad,
},
{
    394.92,397.16
     that you'd show people is you put your fist like this
},
{
    397.16,398.88
     and then you'd twist out like that.
},
{
    398.88,399.72
     Sure.
},
{
    399.72,401.84
     And that's actually a good stretch for your forearm.
},
{
    401.84,402.68
     Yeah.
},
{
    402.68,403.68
     Right, I just always liked that one.
},
{
    403.68,404.52
     It just feels really good.
},
{
    404.52,406.12
     Yeah, that's a nice option.
},
{
    406.12,407.2
     Yeah, we always like to give people
},
{
    407.2,409.0
     a little more than we would say.
},
{
    409.0,412.44
     Now this next one is one I like personally,
},
{
    412.44,414.76
     but it's the decompression or traction.
},
{
    414.76,415.6
     Sure.
},
{
    415.6,418.04
     So all these joints, particularly if you're doing
},
{
    418.04,421.48
     a lot of pushing, you wanna decompress them,
},
{
    421.48,423.76
     pull them apart, let that synovial fluid
},
{
    423.76,425.6
     be able to get into those joint
},
{
    425.6,427.24
     crevasses, if you will.
},
{
    427.24,431.64
     So just relax, this is a hand I'm gonna do the traction on
},
{
    431.64,433.56
     or the decompression, relax it.
},
{
    433.56,437.08
     This hand's gonna grab around the back of the hand
},
{
    437.08,442.08
     and then I'm gonna support the weight of my elbow
},
{
    442.12,443.12
     on my thigh here.
},
{
    443.12,444.44
     You could do this on a table.
},
{
    444.44,446.2
     You probably wanna have a towel there
},
{
    446.2,447.32
     so it's comfortable.
},
{
    447.32,449.92
     Here, as a matter of fact, I'm going to use this.
},
{
    449.92,451.36
     Oh yeah, that helps a little bit.
},
{
    451.36,452.88
     And you just relax it.
},
{
    452.88,457.16
     The other hand, gently pulls and relax.
},
{
    457.16,458.68
     So you got kind of a pumping motion.
},
{
    458.68,461.56
     It's very slow and relax.
},
{
    461.56,463.04
     Now what you can do,
},
{
    463.04,464.6
     this is one of my little tricks I do
},
{
    464.6,467.08
     when my wrist gets kinda sore
},
{
    467.08,469.48
     and it kinda locks up, so I'll pull
},
{
    469.48,470.88
     and then I'll do some rotation.
},
{
    470.88,471.72
     Can you see that, Mike?
},
{
    471.72,473.24
     Oh, so the forearm is rotating.
},
{
    473.24,474.72
     You're not rotating the hand.
},
{
    474.72,475.56
     Exactly.
},
{
    475.56,476.48
     The forearm rotates.
},
{
    476.48,478.8
     This hand is stabilizing the hand.
},
{
    478.8,480.04
     I could see that, that would work.
},
{
    480.04,482.72
     And then I'm just rotating the wrist.
},
{
    482.72,485.7
     And that really gets some nice motion.
},
{
    485.7,486.9
     Did you see that, Mike?
},
{
    488.34,489.6
     You know, along with that,
},
{
    489.6,492.08
     I bet you could even just do a little bit of,
},
{
    492.08,493.44
     you know, pushing up and down.
},
{
    493.44,494.76
     Right, exactly.
},
{
    494.76,497.16
     Yep, you could go up and down this way.
},
{
    497.16,498.8
     Yep, move it all, yep.
},
{
    498.8,500.44
     And with all these things,
},
{
    500.44,503.28
     if you find one direction that feels really good,
},
{
    503.28,504.68
     that's what you wanna keep doing.
},
{
    504.68,505.24
     Exactly, exactly. I wanna show the Mulligan technique very similar to this, to some extent. If you find one direction that feels really good, right? That's what you want to keep doing exactly
},
{
    505.24,509.4
     Exactly, I want to show them all again technique very similar to this. Sure some extent
},
{
    509.4,511.32
     Do you want to have the that's a nice little rest?
},
{
    511.32,516.96
     So what you're gonna do is I'm gonna take my hand and the thumb is gonna push the bones
},
{
    517.6,523.02
     This way sure and my fingers are gonna push it the other way provide a counter force
},
{
    523.24,525.84
     So I go like this I push it over and this is pushing that counter force. So I go like this, I push it over,
},
{
    525.84,527.32
     and this is pushing that way,
},
{
    527.32,529.48
     and then I do flexion and extension while I'm doing that.
},
{
    529.48,533.44
     Oh, yep, yep, yeah, this is a typical Mulligan philosophy.
},
{
    533.44,535.2
     And I've had this where I had,
},
{
    535.2,537.68
     I felt like a wrist need to be cracked
},
{
    537.68,538.84
     or there was a kink in it.
},
{
    538.84,540.0
     Yeah, I know what you mean.
},
{
    540.0,541.28
     And that's where I did that one.
},
{
    541.28,543.52
     And I was like, wow, that felt really good.
},
{
    543.52,544.36
     You saw.
},
{
    544.36,545.2
     You mobilized it. I mobilized it, right. that felt really good. You saw- You mobilized it.
},
{
    545.2,546.04
     I mobilized it.
},
{
    546.04,546.88
     There you go.
},
{
    546.88,548.0
     Again, pain-free.
},
{
    548.0,549.68
     If it hurts, you do not do it.
},
{
    549.68,550.6
     Right.
},
{
    550.6,553.76
     But you'll know right away, does it, oh, it feels fine.
},
{
    553.76,555.0
     No, it doesn't hurt.
},
{
    555.0,556.2
     If it does hurt, you stop.
},
{
    556.2,557.04
     Yeah.
},
{
    557.04,557.88
     Very simple.
},
{
    557.88,558.72
     Exactly, Bob.
},
{
    558.72,559.56
     It's very, very simple.
},
{
    559.56,561.6
     A lot of these treatments are not that difficult.
},
{
    561.6,563.52
     You just have to understand the concept
},
{
    563.52,564.9
     and don't overdo it.
},
{
    564.9,568.16
     Take the way that is pain-free and there you go.
},
{
    568.16,569.0
     It's like a hammer.
},
{
    569.0,571.52
     If you keep hitting your thumb and it hurts,
},
{
    571.52,573.44
     stop hitting your thumb with the hammer.
},
{
    573.44,575.2
     Yeah, then you don't have to take ibuprofen.
},
{
    575.2,576.04
     That's right.
},
{
    576.04,578.64
     So these things are very simple in life if you just follow.
},
{
    578.64,581.16
     Remember Brad and I can fix just about anything.
},
{
    581.16,582.8
     Except for a broken heart.
},
{
    582.8,583.64
     There you go.
},
{
    583.64,584.48
     But we're working on that.
},
{
    584.48,585.76
     I don't know, I feel like Brad
},
{
    585.76,587.44
     hasn't been working hard enough on it.
},
{
    587.44,589.28
     It seems like you're slacking.
},
{
    589.28,592.16
     I know, but I'm gonna work on slacking too.
},
{
    592.16,None
     He's good at that. you
},
