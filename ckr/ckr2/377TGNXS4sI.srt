     If you've suffered an ankle sprain, one of the most common injuries in all of sports,
},
{
    5.52,9.72
     we want to show you some exercises to get better, hopefully on your own.
},
{
    9.72,14.36
     I'm Dr. David Geyer, orthopedic surgeon and sports medicine specialist, here with my friend
},
{
    14.36,17.2
     and physical therapist, Yves Gigi.
},
{
    17.2,22.52
     Ankle sprains are the most common injuries statistically in sports like football, basketball,
},
{
    22.52,25.16
     soccer, not to mention all the weekend warriors,
},
{
    25.16,27.32
     all the people who just love to exercise.
},
{
    27.32,30.8
     You're running along, step awkwardly, and roll your foot.
},
{
    30.8,33.68
     Or you land awkwardly and roll your ankle.
},
{
    33.68,35.84
     What can you do to get over that,
},
{
    35.84,37.52
     short of going into the doctor
},
{
    37.52,39.44
     and getting x-rays and all that kind of stuff,
},
{
    39.44,40.68
     which you might need,
},
{
    40.68,42.16
     but are there some simple things
},
{
    42.16,43.96
     that you might be able to do first?
},
{
    43.96,48.48
     Let's see what Eve has to suggest. So you get that initial ankle sprain right? It's
},
{
    48.48,52.48
     gonna be a little bit swollen, it's gonna be a little bit inflamed. So by far the
},
{
    52.48,55.76
     first thing that we tell people to do is to get a little bit of compression, a
},
{
    55.76,59.44
     little bit of elevation and be cautious with the weight bearing to let that
},
{
    59.44,63.52
     thing heal. Yeah that makes sense. Yeah but as soon as that healing
},
{
    63.52,66.46
     healing starts to happen and there's not as much swelling,
},
{
    66.46,70.76
     we want to work on getting range of motion and getting some movement back in the ankle
},
{
    70.76,74.12
     as early as possible to make sure that you're getting back on the field.
},
{
    74.12,75.12
     Okay.
},
{
    75.12,76.62
     Getting back to walk in as quickly as possible.
},
{
    76.62,78.72
     So that's our first exercise we're going to go through.
},
{
    78.72,79.72
     All right.
},
{
    79.72,81.72
     First one, we're just going to pretend this is a chair.
},
{
    81.72,85.2
     So we're just going to have a seat in the chair
},
{
    88.8,89.6
     We're gonna cross one leg over the other. Okay
},
{
    96.8,98.12
     This is pretty easy for you to do at home. You're gonna grab the outside of your foot. Okay, and then you're gonna pull up
},
{
    99.96,105.0
     Towards the ceiling Gently and you should feel a stretch just on the outside of your ankle
},
{
    105.0,109.32
     and it in that tender sore area. You want to be pretty cautious with this.
},
{
    109.4,113.2
     You want to go slowly and as soon as you start to feel a little bit of stretch of pain,
},
{
    113.2,117.56
     you're going to stop and you're going to hold it there anywhere from 30 seconds to a minute.
},
{
    117.56,122.2
     Yeah, almost all ankle sprains are going to be injuries to the ligaments on the outside of your ankle.
},
{
    122.2,126.86
     And that's why that makes sense that you would do exercises to work that side.
},
{
    126.86,128.34
     And you can actually really feel that.
},
{
    128.34,130.1
     That's really interesting.
},
{
    131.3,133.9
     Something you go just where you feel tightness,
},
{
    133.9,137.1
     but you know, and slow, steady movements.
},
{
    137.1,138.46
     Okay, that makes sense.
},
{
    138.46,139.3
     Too far.
},
{
    139.3,142.14
     The tendon itself still needs time to heal, right?
},
{
    142.14,144.5
     You know this, we gotta respect that healing time,
},
{
    144.5,149.68
     but it's a great way to start getting movement back early. So the second thing after we've gotten
},
{
    149.68,154.32
     some movement back, and we know this happens a lot after swelling, after these injuries,
},
{
    154.32,160.48
     is that some of our balance, or if you want to use a fancy term, proprioception, is a little bit
},
{
    160.48,164.16
     hindered and needs to get work back, right? So we want to make sure we start working our balance
},
{
    164.16,167.72
     again. So first thing we're gonna do, super easy exercise.
},
{
    167.72,168.92
     Believe it or not, you don't have to tell my patients
},
{
    168.92,171.28
     to do this when they're brushing their teeth.
},
{
    171.28,172.12
     Oh, that makes sense.
},
{
    172.12,172.96
     Super easy time, right?
},
{
    172.96,174.32
     So the whole time you're brushing your teeth,
},
{
    174.32,176.04
     try this exercise.
},
{
    176.04,177.2
     You can do it more throughout the day,
},
{
    177.2,178.16
     but it's a great time to do it.
},
{
    178.16,180.88
     So you're just gonna stand on one leg,
},
{
    180.88,182.6
     bring the other leg up.
},
{
    182.6,184.2
     Doesn't matter if you're bringing forward, back,
},
{
    184.2,185.64
     as long as it's off of
},
{
    185.64,189.48
     the ground and you're gonna hold that for as long as you can. It's pretty normal
},
{
    189.48,194.4
     to see the ankle shaking left to right. Those are called ankle strategies.
},
{
    194.4,198.96
     Perfectly normal. If it's painful, maybe hold on to something.
},
{
    198.96,203.36
     Big sense. And then work your way to not holding anything. Doing that anywhere
},
{
    203.36,207.4
     from a minute. Sometimes longer depends on how long you reach your teeth.
},
{
    207.4,209.68
     But holding that and starting to work those muscles
},
{
    209.68,210.52
     should be great.
},
{
    210.52,211.8
     Well, and that makes a lot of sense too,
},
{
    211.8,215.48
     because one of the challenges that I see with athletes
},
{
    215.48,217.24
     trying to get back to sports,
},
{
    217.24,220.28
     it's been three weeks, two, four weeks, whatever it's been,
},
{
    220.28,222.28
     is that yeah, the ankle's got good motion,
},
{
    222.28,223.36
     it's got good strength,
},
{
    223.36,224.88
     but they don't feel confident
},
{
    224.88,226.78
     planning their foot and changing direction.
},
{
    226.78,228.6
     And that's why what he's talking about
},
{
    228.6,231.7
     with the balance and proprioception is so important.
},
{
    231.7,234.4
     But time alone is not gonna really do that much
},
{
    234.4,235.24
     to get it back.
},
{
    235.24,237.44
     You actually have to work to restore that.
},
{
    237.44,239.12
     Yeah, yeah, you need to work that system.
},
{
    239.12,241.0
     If I'm gonna cut directions quickly,
},
{
    241.0,242.96
     my ankle needs to know what it feels like
},
{
    242.96,251.24
     to be on one leg first before I do that. And sometimes it's a step that a lot of people skip. And if you're getting better but not getting over the hump,
},
{
    251.24,254.66
     you can, you know, you might think about working with a physical therapist like Eve,
},
{
    254.68,256.64
     because he can not only do things like that,
},
{
    256.64,262.76
     but then they can start putting you on sliding boards and do fancier ways to rebuild that balance and proprioception
},
{
    262.98,268.64
     that really can speed up your recovery and return to sports. If you've suffered an ankle sprain and I
},
{
    268.64,273.28
     know that a lot of you out there have because it's so common, try these simple
},
{
    273.28,277.24
     exercises out. Hopefully it gets you better in a week or two or three or four
},
{
    277.24,281.16
     weeks. If you're not making much progress, see a physical therapist. Go see an
},
{
    281.16,284.72
     orthopedic surgeon to make sure it's not something bad. If you want more
