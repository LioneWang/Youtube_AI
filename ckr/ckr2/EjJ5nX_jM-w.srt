     Exercises are very important to helping your shoulder heal.
},
{
    21.4,26.0
     To begin, you will do exercises in which you do not actively use the muscles
},
{
    26.0,32.28
     in your healing shoulder. These are called passive motion exercises. They help you regain
},
{
    32.28,37.88
     movement in your shoulder. When it is safe to do so, you will graduate two exercises
},
{
    37.88,42.72
     that begin using the muscles in your healing shoulder with the help or assistance of your
},
{
    42.72,45.52
     other arm. These are called active
},
{
    45.52,50.4
     assisted exercises. The last phase of exercise involves stretching and
},
{
    50.4,55.24
     strengthening the muscles in your healing arm. Only do your exercises on the
},
{
    55.24,60.2
     schedule provided by your surgeon or physical therapist. It can delay your
},
{
    60.2,66.36
     recovery to do active assisted, stretching or strengthening exercises too soon.
},
{
    66.36,72.04
     To protect your shoulder, do not do any exercise until your surgeon or physical therapist has
},
{
    72.04,78.22
     shown you how to do it. Follow his or her instructions. Do not move your healing arm
},
{
    78.22,87.06
     any farther than he or she tells you to move it. Do your exercises slowly and gently. You may feel some discomfort in your
},
{
    87.06,93.38
     healing shoulder even before you begin your exercises. But if pain increases while doing
},
{
    93.38,100.38
     an exercise, stop right away and relax your shoulder. If the pain returns to your starting
},
{
    100.38,106.08
     level after you stop the exercise, try it again, slower and with less intensity.
},
{
    106.88,112.24
     If you continue to feel increased pain even though you've stopped the exercise,
},
{
    112.24,116.4
     talk with a member of your health care team before continuing to exercise.
},
{
    117.28,125.0
     You will need a helper for these exercises. Lie down with folded towels under your elbow to keep it forward.
},
{
    125.0,128.64
     Your arm needs to be released from the sling.
},
{
    128.64,134.32
     Before beginning the exercises, do some movements to warm up your elbow and hand.
},
{
    134.32,139.14
     Start with your elbow bent so your healing arm lies across your stomach.
},
{
    139.14,144.0
     To warm up your elbow, your helper gently straightens your arm so it is even with your
},
{
    144.0,145.64
     leg on that side of your body.
},
{
    145.64,154.44
     Your arm should stay close to the sling. To warm up your hand, make a tight fist,
},
{
    154.44,167.4
     then spread your fingers. For the first exercise, start with your arm lying across your stomach, palm down. Rest your elbow on the folded towels.
},
{
    167.4,168.68
     Relax.
},
{
    168.68,171.88
     Don't use the muscles of your shoulder or arm.
},
{
    171.88,175.52
     Instead, your helper gently moves your forearm away
},
{
    175.52,176.96
     from your body.
},
{
    176.96,180.28
     Your elbow should stay at your side.
},
{
    180.28,183.32
     Do not allow your arm to be moved any farther than you've
},
{
    183.32,185.0
     been told to move it. Do not allow your arm to be moved any farther than you've been told to move it.
},
{
    185.0,190.0
     Do not allow your arm to be moved to the point that you feel increased pain.
},
{
    190.0,195.0
     Breathe normally as you exercise. Don't hold your breath.
},
{
    195.0,201.0
     For the next exercise, your helper puts one hand under your elbow and grasps your wrist.
},
{
    201.0,207.88
     He or she moves your forearm away from your body to the point that you feel a stretch.
},
{
    207.88,213.8
     Then your helper gently pushes on your elbow to guide your hand toward your head.
},
{
    213.8,217.04
     Do not use the muscles of your shoulder or arm.
},
{
    217.04,221.88
     Do not allow your arm to be moved any farther than you've been told to move it.
},
{
    221.88,225.4
     Do not allow your arm to be moved to the point that you feel increased
},
{
    225.4,231.12
     pain. An exercise called dangling involves a motion
},
{
    231.12,236.72
     you'll use for dressing and other activities of daily living. Ask your helper to remove
},
{
    236.72,242.52
     your sling for this exercise. Support your healing arm with your other hand so it doesn't
},
{
    242.52,249.14
     drop. Stand next to a counter or a sturdy piece of furniture with your legs shoulder-width
},
{
    249.14,252.88
     apart and your heeling arm in front of your body.
},
{
    252.88,257.2
     Bend at the waist, supporting yourself with your other arm.
},
{
    257.2,262.2
     Lower your heeling arm until it dangles like a necktie or scarf.
},
{
    262.2,266.48
     Straighten up and grasp your heeling arm with your other hand, bending it at the
},
{
    266.48,274.08
     elbow. Keep your arm close to your body. Keep your elbow in front of your body. Don't use
},
{
    274.08,280.48
     the muscles in your healing shoulder. The other arm does all the work. If necessary, you can
},
{
    280.48,286.2
     do this exercise while seated. Faithfully doing your passive motion exercises
},
{
    286.2,290.2
     is an important first step to helping your shoulder heal.
