     Hi, I'm Gina Solomon.
},
{
    9.56,13.84
     I am the Trauma Program Manager here at Gwinnett Medical Center.
},
{
    13.84,17.72
     Uncontrolled life-threatening hemorrhage is one of the leading causes of preventable death
},
{
    17.72,19.8
     after traumatic injury.
},
{
    19.8,24.84
     Gwinnett Medical Center is partnering with the National Stop the Bleak campaign to provide
},
{
    24.84,28.2
     training to bystanders on how to control this life-threatening
},
{
    28.2,33.08
     hemorrhage. Everyone should know how to identify life-threatening bleeding and
},
{
    33.08,37.16
     know how to take the appropriate steps to control the bleeding until help
},
{
    37.16,41.56
     arrives. There are a couple of primary principles to controlling life-threatening
},
{
    41.56,45.52
     hemorrhage. First off is to ensure your own safety.
},
{
    45.52,48.04
     It's very important that you make sure you are safe
},
{
    48.04,51.64
     before you render aid to anyone else.
},
{
    51.64,53.24
     The second principle is what we call
},
{
    53.24,55.52
     the ABCs of bleeding control.
},
{
    55.52,58.48
     A, alert, you wanna call 911.
},
{
    58.48,61.52
     B, bleeding, be able to identify
},
{
    61.52,62.84
     the life-threatening bleeding.
},
{
    62.84,64.52
     And C, compress.
},
{
    64.52,68.12
     And there's three ways that you can compress the bleeding and we're going to go into detail
},
{
    68.12,70.22
     about each one of those.
},
{
    70.22,73.16
     The first principle of the ABC is A, alert.
},
{
    73.16,74.36
     Call 911.
},
{
    74.36,79.24
     It is really important that you get the pre-hospital providers en route to take over care while
},
{
    79.24,82.6
     you render A. B is bleeding.
},
{
    82.6,85.44
     Being able to identify what is life-threatening bleeding.
},
{
    85.44,88.48
     If you see bleeding spurting from a wound,
},
{
    88.48,92.52
     pouring from a wound, clothes that are soaked in blood,
},
{
    92.52,95.76
     you have bandages that are soaked in blood.
},
{
    95.76,98.68
     If the person is missing all or part of a limb,
},
{
    98.68,102.52
     an arm or a leg, or the person is becoming dizzy
},
{
    102.52,106.66
     or unconscious, those are all signs of life-threatening bleeding.
},
{
    106.66,111.8
     Wounds that can lead to death from bleeding are often located in the arms and legs,
},
{
    111.8,117.3
     torso junctional, which is the armpits, the groin, or the neck,
},
{
    117.3,121.0
     or the chest and the abdomen, or internal bleeding.
},
{
    121.0,130.64
     Unfortunately with internal bleeding, bystanders cannot really impact those injuries and they need quick access to a trauma center. And then see
},
{
    130.64,138.04
     compress. There are three ways to compress. First is just holding pressure. It is
},
{
    138.04,142.44
     really important that if you have access to gloves, you want to put those on
},
{
    142.44,150.56
     before you render any care. If you can protect yourself from blood-borne pathogens, this is an important safety step. So you'll want
},
{
    150.56,157.56
     to put your gloves on. And then if you have access to gauze, that is great. But if you
},
{
    160.34,169.08
     do not, any clean cloth will work. If you have a clean towel, a t-shirt, whatever you may have handy will work just as well.
},
{
    169.08,175.52
     You want to take the gauze or the clean cloth and fold it and place it directly over the
},
{
    175.52,176.64
     wound.
},
{
    176.64,182.36
     You want to put the heel of one hand on the cloth, the heel of your other hand on top of
},
{
    182.36,187.04
     your first hand and lean in and put as much pressure on the wound as you
},
{
    187.04,193.76
     can. You want to stay this way until help arrives. Do not peek, you don't want to look, you just want
},
{
    193.76,198.4
     to hold pressure until the pre-hospital personnel can arrive and take over care.
},
{
    200.56,205.8
     The second principle of compress is tourniquets. Tourniquets are used when you have life-threatening
},
{
    205.8,212.8
     bleeding to an arm or a leg. If you have access to a bleeding control kit, they will have
},
{
    212.8,217.92
     tourniquets in them. This is what's known as a cat tourniquet and is the most common
},
{
    217.92,228.88
     tourniquet that is placed in those kits. It is a Velcro band, so you just want to unfold the band and take the circle and place it
},
{
    228.88,232.56
     on the limb over the site of the bleeding.
},
{
    232.56,238.04
     It's really important that you go above the wound and you also want to go above a knee
},
{
    238.04,239.4
     or an elbow.
},
{
    239.4,245.92
     It is okay to put it on top of clothing, just make sure there's nothing bulky in a pocket like keys or such
},
{
    245.92,248.12
     that would impact the tension
},
{
    248.12,250.08
     that we're gonna place on the tourniquet.
},
{
    251.08,254.12
     You want to take the Velcro strap
},
{
    254.12,256.44
     and tighten it down on the limb.
},
{
    258.52,260.46
     It just has to be snug.
},
{
    261.36,263.68
     You are then gonna notice there is a rod
},
{
    263.68,265.16
     that is attached to the tourniquet.
},
{
    265.16,270.68
     Once you have the Velcro strap snug on the limb you want to turn the rod as
},
{
    270.68,277.0
     tight as you can. You're going to twist until you cannot twist anymore and it is
},
{
    277.0,285.56
     very tight. Once you can no longer tighten the rod, you're going to place it in the C-clip to hold the
},
{
    285.56,288.2
     rod in place.
},
{
    288.2,293.92
     You then can take what's left of the strap and place it on top of the rod through the
},
{
    293.92,295.44
     strap.
},
{
    295.44,302.76
     Many of the tourniquets will have another Velcro strap that you can place over the C-clamp.
},
{
    302.76,308.0
     Tourniquets are very painful and it's okay to tell the injured person that this is going to hurt.
},
{
    308.0,309.9
     You do not want to loosen it.
},
{
    309.9,315.0
     You want to leave it as is until the pre-hospital providers take over care.
},
{
    315.0,318.4
     They can give the person pain medicine to help with the pain,
},
{
    318.4,323.3
     but it is normal for them to feel significant pain after the turnip kit has been placed.
},
{
    323.3,326.6
     The third principle to compress is wound packing.
},
{
    326.6,329.36
     Again, if you have access to gauze, that is great,
},
{
    329.36,332.04
     but if you do not, any clean cloth t-shirt
},
{
    332.04,333.44
     can be used as well.
},
{
    335.12,338.48
     What we're gonna do here is actually insert the gauze
},
{
    339.38,342.64
     or the clean cloth into the wound to stop bleeding.
},
{
    343.96,347.1
     So you want to take the end of the gauze or cloth
},
{
    347.1,348.98
     and actually pack the wound.
},
{
    348.98,352.98
     You want to use your fingers to place the gauze tightly
},
{
    352.98,358.1
     and as deeply into the wound as you possibly can.
},
{
    358.1,359.7
     And you're going to continue to pack
},
{
    359.7,363.3
     until you cannot get any more gauze or cloth into the wound.
},
{
    365.96,369.58
     Once you have packed it as tightly as you can,
},
{
    369.58,372.06
     you then want to compress with pressure.
},
{
    372.06,374.98
     So you want to put what's left of your gauze or t-shirt
},
{
    374.98,378.54
     on top of the wound, apply the heel of your hand,
},
{
    378.54,380.38
     the heel of your other hand on top of that
},
{
    380.38,383.26
     and lean and apply direct pressure.
},
{
    383.26,385.68
     Again, you do not want to let off of the pressure
},
{
    385.68,389.28
     until the pre-hospital personnel arrive to take over care.
},
{
    389.28,391.12
     Bystanders can make a huge impact
},
{
    391.12,392.28
     with life-threatening bleeding
},
{
    392.28,395.12
     until first responders can arrive.
},
{
    395.12,397.16
     The only thing more tragic than a death
},
{
    397.16,399.12
     is a death that can be prevented.
},
{
    399.12,399.96
     Thank you.
},
