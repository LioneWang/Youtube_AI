{
    0.0,25.46
     All right, we're going to take a look at that typical forward head posture that a lot of
},
{
    25.46,31.22
     us find ourselves in throughout the day and show how to come out of that.
},
{
    31.22,34.16
     Sit up straight, get the shoulders back.
},
{
    34.16,39.12
     To start the stretch, we're going to tuck the chin, reach around with the other hand
},
{
    39.12,42.24
     at the top of the neck, the base of the skull there.
},
{
    42.24,46.2
     I'm pulling up, keeping the chin tucked, pulling
},
{
    46.2,51.56
     up, getting a deep stretch at the top part of the neck and actually throughout all of
},
{
    51.56,58.56
     the back of the neck. Take a look at this from another view. Again, I'm pulling up there.
},
{
    58.92,65.16
     Deep stretch that is an area that is usually tied on people with that type of head posture. These
},
{
    65.16,69.48
     stretches can be held for about 10 seconds and you can do a few sets of
},
{
    69.48,73.92
     those. I recommend at least two, maybe even three sets. Again hold it for about
},
{
    73.92,76.64
     10 seconds.
},
{
    84.32,88.88
     All right in this next stretch here we're going to stretch more of this side in the
},
{
    88.88,91.4
     front of the neck.
},
{
    91.4,95.0
     Usually in area that's tight, that's kind of what pulls that head forward.
},
{
    95.0,98.4
     So we really want to get into the side and the front of the neck.
},
{
    98.4,100.16
     You'll notice my shoulder is back.
},
{
    100.16,106.64
     I'm gently reaching around with the other hand and pulling towards the other side.
},
{
    106.64,111.64
     One thing that you can't see here, but I am holding the bottom of a chair to keep that
},
{
    111.64,112.8
     shoulder down.
},
{
    112.8,117.68
     So I would recommend either grab onto the bottom of a chair or you can sit on your hand with
},
{
    117.68,119.44
     the palm up.
},
{
    119.44,127.44
     That will help keep that shoulder down as you bring your neck towards the other side.
},
{
    127.44,131.8
     When I start to stretch, I am looking towards the side I'm stretching.
},
{
    131.8,135.36
     Again here you can see me using that hand to pull that over.
},
{
    135.36,137.34
     Again be very gentle.
},
{
    137.34,141.44
     And now you see me rotating away towards the other side.
},
{
    141.44,147.0
     This is just to show the different angles that you could potentially stretch.
},
{
    149.0,153.56
     Let's look at the other side here. Again, I am reaching over, I'm looking towards the
},
{
    153.56,160.56
     side I'm stretching. Hold again, same thing, you can hold this for 10 seconds, you can
},
{
    160.86,165.28
     do a few sets on both sides.
},
{
    165.28,172.88
     And again, just demonstrating, as I look away, I'm going to get different areas of that neck.
},
{
    172.88,176.66
     Each of us have different areas where that tension is located.
},
{
    176.66,179.88
     So this is going to be just a little bit different for everybody.
},
{
    179.88,188.4
     I want you to play with it, find that area that is tight on you, and go ahead and hold that stretch again for about 10 seconds.
},
{
    188.4,189.42
     Be very gentle.
},
{
    189.42,190.84
     These are delicate muscles.
},
{
    203.88,209.68
     All right, let's get into the most important part of this series and that is the exercise.
},
{
    209.68,212.14
     Show you how to get into good posture.
},
{
    212.14,216.56
     You notice before I had that forward head posture that we typically see and now I'm
},
{
    216.56,221.28
     getting the head back, getting the ears over the shoulders where they're supposed to be.
},
{
    221.28,223.68
     Let's look at that again.
},
{
    223.68,224.68
     Forward head posture.
},
{
    224.68,231.32
     I'm going to bring the shoulders back, chest up, and ears over the shoulder. I really tuck the chin. That's
},
{
    231.32,239.32
     important for this exercise. You can watch that one more time. The most important part
},
{
    239.32,244.04
     of this exercise is to really tuck that chin. Don't let that double chin discourage you.
},
{
    244.04,248.56
     You're only going to hold this for about 10 seconds. So what we're going to do is once we find
},
{
    248.56,253.52
     that good posture where we want that neck to be with the chin tuck, I am pressing my
},
{
    253.52,259.04
     forehead into my hands. We press there about 50% of your strength. You don't want to press
},
{
    259.04,265.44
     too hard. And again, most important thing, keep the chin tucked. I can't say that enough.
},
{
    265.44,267.56
     And I'm just pressing that forehead into my hands.
},
{
    267.56,273.4
     And again, if you're just starting out, about five seconds,
},
{
    273.4,276.04
     once you get used to this, you've been working a few days,
},
{
    276.04,278.68
     maybe go 10, 15 seconds.
},
{
    278.68,282.56
     Really, you just want to get your, get those muscles activated,
},
{
    282.56,285.9
     five, 10, 15 seconds, but then do it several times.
},
{
    298.94,300.8
     We'll show that again.
},
{
    300.8,302.9
     It is called neck retraction.
},
{
    303.96,308.4
     And you're strengthening deep muscles in the neck as
},
{
    308.4,314.96
     you do this exercise. The muscles that are required to keep your head and neck posture
},
{
    314.96,320.76
     aligned properly. Again, that double chin, don't let that discourage you. That's the
},
{
    320.76,326.54
     most common complaint I hear about this exercise. Not that it's difficult, that it gives me a double chin.
},
{
    326.54,329.94
     You're holding this for 15 seconds at the most.
},
{
    329.94,None
     Just practice this again every day and if you have any questions, let us know. you
},
