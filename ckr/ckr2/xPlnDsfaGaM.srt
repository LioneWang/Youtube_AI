},
{
    17.4,18.8
     In my opinion, today we're gonna talk about
},
{
    18.8,23.12
     three easiest ways to stop leg foot,
},
{
    23.12,25.0
     leg slash foot pain,
},
{
    25.36,28.08

},
{
    30.24,33.56

},
{
    33.56,34.4
     Doesn't happen a lot.
},
{
    34.4,35.72
     And no posture either.
},
{
    35.72,36.76
     We don't want that either.

     Once again, you continue to amaze our viewers.
},
{
    70.76,73.88
     So this is something that I wanted to bring up.
},
{
    73.88,76.6
     We got leg pain, foot pain,
},
{
    76.6,79.16
     oftentimes associated with swelling.
},
{
    79.16,81.4
     There's typically two categories.
},
{
    81.4,83.32
     Oftentimes if you sprain your ankle
},
{
    83.32,85.32
     or some kind of traumatic injury,
},
{
    85.32,88.28
     swelling and pain associated.
},
{
    88.28,90.76
     And the treatment for that as well as people
},
{
    90.76,92.76
     have chronic swelling,
},
{
    92.76,95.12
     oftentimes from congestive heart failure
},
{
    95.12,97.4
     or some other issues related to the heart
},
{
    97.4,99.32
     that fluid the limbs.
},
{
    99.32,100.16
     Yeah, gathers in the legs.
},
{
    100.16,102.28
     Yeah, gathers in the legs and it doesn't come up.
},
{
    102.28,104.56
     And you can get dramatic swelling in the ankles.
},
{
    104.56,105.72
     Oh yeah, absolutely. Associated with pain. Quite a bit of weight. Yeah, gathers into legs and it doesn't come up. And you can get dramatic swelling in the ankles. Oh yeah, absolutely.
},
{
    105.72,107.16
     Associated with pains.
},
{
    107.16,108.28
     Getting quite a bit of weight.
},
{
    108.28,109.24
     Yeah, exactly.
},
{
    109.24,111.2
     Yeah, it can be a real serious problem
},
{
    111.2,112.8
     if it gets carried away.
},
{
    112.8,116.16
     So we're gonna talk about three easy solutions,
},
{
    116.16,118.04
     relatively easy solutions,
},
{
    118.04,121.0
     but you need to know what to do and when to do it.
},
{
    121.0,122.24
     And when it's safe to do it.
},
{
    122.24,123.08
     Right, exactly.
},
{
    123.08,125.08
     We gotta make sure that you're always, you know,
},
{
    125.08,128.24
     following the medical advice that your physician
},
{
    128.24,130.08
     may be given to you.
},
{
    130.08,131.04
     Exactly.
},
{
    131.04,133.52
     So first of all, if you do have swelling,
},
{
    133.52,136.12
     whether it's from an injury or this chronic,
},
{
    136.12,139.8
     elevation is one of the things that's pretty safe to do.
},
{
    139.8,141.72
     I don't think you have to get ahold of a doctor.
},
{
    141.72,142.56
     Right.
},
{
    142.56,146.38
     So laying down the rule of thumb is elevate the swall part,
},
{
    146.38,149.28
     in this case the leg, higher than the heart.
},
{
    149.28,154.28
     So you can do that laying in bed or on your couch or whatever.
},
{
    154.88,156.98
     I should maybe get a pillow here, Bob.
},
{
    159.56,162.32
     So you can just take two or three pillows
},
{
    162.32,166.68
     and put them underneath your legs, particularly the calf.
},
{
    166.68,168.04
     Yeah, this one'd be enough.
},
{
    168.04,169.8
     Yeah, that would be not enough.
},
{
    170.76,172.44
     Probably two pillows, you know,
},
{
    172.44,174.16
     even if I put another pillow here.
},
{
    174.16,175.6
     Just not even then.
},
{
    175.6,176.6
     It's better than flat.
},
{
    176.6,178.8
     It's better, but look, it's still below your heart.
},
{
    178.8,180.12
     Right.
},
{
    180.12,182.24
     So stack pillows as needed
},
{
    182.24,183.36
     because you want to be comfortable.
},
{
    183.36,186.72
     One thing we really like if you have chronic problem. And that shows you why, because you want to be comfortable. One thing we really like, if you have chronic problem.
},
{
    186.72,187.82
     And that shows you why,
},
{
    187.82,189.5
     because you need so many pillows,
},
{
    189.5,192.04
     but you could do it with one leg wedge.
},
{
    192.04,192.88
     These are nice.
},
{
    192.88,194.4
     And they're not that expensive.
},
{
    194.4,196.28
     Yeah, they're nice for back pain too.
},
{
    196.28,198.44
     Yeah, so we get that, now we're elevated.
},
{
    198.44,200.0
     It's very comfortable.
},
{
    200.0,202.52
     I've had almost all my patients say,
},
{
    202.52,206.36
     this feels good, it elevates, it's comfortable.
},
{
    206.36,207.84
     And you can do your ankle pump.
},
{
    207.84,208.8
     Yes, you got room.
},
{
    208.8,211.52
     And you also had mentioned in the past, Brad,
},
{
    211.52,214.32
     that some of these are a little bit longer in length.
},
{
    214.32,215.16
     Right, yeah.
},
{
    215.16,216.56
     Except if you're like me,
},
{
    216.56,218.36
     you're gonna have a lot of legs sticking out
},
{
    218.36,219.44
     over the edge of your.
},
{
    219.44,222.04
     If you're taller than six foot, you'll wanna get,
},
{
    222.04,224.32
     then they show a dimension from this corner on.
},
{
    224.32,225.8
     And that's for the taller people.
},
{
    225.8,227.64
     They must have different heights too, don't they?
},
{
    227.64,228.6
     Yeah, I believe so.
},
{
    228.6,231.24
     Typically I believe this is eight or 10 inches.
},
{
    231.24,233.16
     And that's typically enough for most people.
},
{
    233.16,234.6
     So just pay attention to that.
},
{
    234.6,235.44
     Exactly.
},
{
    235.44,237.0
     So the other thing you can do,
},
{
    237.0,240.64
     if it is a problem from an injury and it's swollen
},
{
    240.64,242.48
     like a sprained ankle, you can do this
},
{
    242.48,246.64
     and you can put a cold pack around your ankle or knee, whatever it is that's swollen like a sprained ankle, you can do this. And you can put a cold pack around your ankle or knee,
},
{
    246.64,248.22
     whatever it is that's swollen.
},
{
    248.22,250.84
     And that'll be beneficial for 10 to 20 minutes.
},
{
    250.84,254.94
     Usually people that have chronic swelling, the lymphedema,
},
{
    254.94,257.28
     cold packs are not used with that.
},
{
    257.28,258.82
     I mean, there may be exceptions,
},
{
    258.82,261.38
     but you would want to get that from your doctor.
},
{
    261.38,262.6
     If you have chronic swelling,
},
{
    262.6,265.36
     this is a great position because of the exercise.
},
{
    265.36,267.12
     You can do the exercise in this position.
},
{
    267.12,269.52
     Even though we mentioned without exercise,
},
{
    269.52,273.64
     you can augment and help with ankle pumps.
},
{
    273.64,274.84
     It's very simple.
},
{
    274.84,275.8
     Butt squeezes too.
},
{
    275.8,277.08
     Oh yeah, yeah.
},
{
    277.08,277.92
     And there's a massage.
},
{
    277.92,281.4
     We've got a really nice video by Aaron,
},
{
    281.4,283.72
     a guest therapist who is certified in this
},
{
    283.72,286.64
     on how to do massage for lymphedema.
},
{
    286.64,289.08
     And if you look up Google bathroom massage too.
},
{
    289.08,291.4
     Yep, self massage for lymphedema.
},
{
    291.4,294.32
     Aaron will go through that in an excellent way.
},
{
    294.32,297.16
     Anything else with elevation, Bob?
},
{
    297.16,298.0
     Covers it.
},
{
    298.0,300.24
     Good, good, excellent.
},
{
    300.24,301.88
     So next one, number two.
},
{
    301.88,305.76
     Now this one is very commonly used
},
{
    305.76,309.42
     is compression garments.
},
{
    309.42,312.14
     Now, when I first was in therapy
},
{
    312.14,314.18
     and I didn't have this at school,
},
{
    314.18,318.06
     I thought, well, if you put some kind of compression garment
},
{
    318.06,320.1
     on your leg to squeeze that fluid out,
},
{
    320.1,322.94
     you want to get a nice tight, the tighter the better.
},
{
    322.94,325.48
     Not the case whatsoever. It's, you're gonna get a nice tight, the tighter the better. Not the case whatsoever.
},
{
    325.48,328.28
     It's, you're gonna get in trouble with this.
},
{
    328.28,329.12
     So,
},
{
    329.12,329.96
     Right, exactly.
},
{
    329.96,331.56
     So compression garments,
},
{
    332.48,336.28
     you can do, you can use Acerap,
},
{
    336.28,340.12
     or a Comperlon, which is a higher grade.
},
{
    340.12,341.6
     It's got some special qualities.
},
{
    341.6,342.84
     It doesn't stretch as much.
},
{
    342.84,344.48
     And so it doesn't.
},
{
    344.48,345.8
     Yeah, it doesn't get too tight. Yeah, it doesn't get too tight.
},
{
    345.8,347.08
     Right, it doesn't get too tight.
},
{
    347.08,349.16
     We're not getting into that with this video
},
{
    349.16,350.92
     because there's some skill involved.
},
{
    350.92,353.92
     You have to be taught how to wrap it properly.
},
{
    353.92,355.92
     The two things that are much easier,
},
{
    355.92,358.84
     and this is commonly used in the medical field,
},
{
    358.84,360.24
     is tuba grip.
},
{
    360.24,364.32
     It's not that expensive and it comes in a big long roll.
},
{
    364.32,367.18
     You can buy it by the foot or you can buy a whole roll. And it's a tuba grip because it's not that expensive and it comes in a big long roll. You can buy it by the foot or you can buy a whole roll.
},
{
    367.18,369.64
     And it's a tube of grip because it's just that.
},
{
    369.64,371.08
     There's, it's a tube.
},
{
    371.08,372.84
     You can't, yeah, it grips.
},
{
    372.84,374.4
     You can actually use it on your arms.
},
{
    374.4,377.56
     I've used it with patients on their arms or legs.
},
{
    377.56,382.16
     Let's say you have swelling from your knee on down.
},
{
    382.16,386.22
     What we need to get is something about 15 to 20 millimeters of pressure.
},
{
    386.22,387.18
     That's how they measure it.
},
{
    387.18,390.84
     And you can ask, tuber grip comes in different sizes.
},
{
    390.84,393.9
     It's known by letters, A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
},
{
    393.9,397.04
     You do have to look that up, the girth of your leg
},
{
    397.04,398.74
     versus the size of this.
},
{
    398.74,400.68
     A therapist, where you buy it,
},
{
    400.68,403.18
     they should have specifications on it.
},
{
    403.18,405.82
     If you do have chronic swelling,
},
{
    405.82,407.58
     Bob, you had mentioned this before,
},
{
    407.58,409.34
     you're not gonna wanna do this.
},
{
    409.34,410.7
     Unless you got it okayed with your-
},
{
    410.7,412.14
     Get it okayed with your doctor,
},
{
    412.14,417.14
     because if you bring the swelling out of your legs too fast,
},
{
    417.58,419.3
     it can overwhelm the heart.
},
{
    419.3,422.26
     And it can be a very critical situation.
},
{
    422.26,424.7
     Yes, and so your physician will guide you
},
{
    424.7,427.92
     as to whether or not something like this is even advisable.
},
{
    427.92,428.76
     Exactly.
},
{
    428.76,431.24
     We should explain Brad that when there's fluid
},
{
    431.24,434.28
     in the leg like this for it to go out of the leg,
},
{
    434.28,436.96
     it doesn't seep out of the toes.
},
{
    436.96,439.36
     It's gotta go back up into your body,
},
{
    439.36,441.92
     up into the abdomen where it's processed
},
{
    441.92,443.76
     and then you pee it out basically.
},
{
    443.76,445.12
     Right, exactly. So it's gotta and then you pee it out, basically. Right, exactly.
},
{
    445.12,448.28
     So it's gotta, you gotta have it so that basically
},
{
    448.28,451.56
     it's trying to encourage the fluid to go this way.
},
{
    451.56,452.4
     Right.
},
{
    452.4,456.24
     But if it's too tight, the fluid, the lymphedema
},
{
    456.24,458.36
     is just under the skin.
},
{
    458.36,460.24
     And that's why if you have too tight,
},
{
    460.24,462.6
     it actually collapses the pathways
},
{
    462.6,464.08
     and it gets stuck in there.
},
{
    464.08,466.76
     And then, you know, if this is too tight,
},
{
    466.76,469.76
     I've seen people with this too tight on all of a sudden
},
{
    469.76,472.28
     and they always recommend not covering the toes up.
},
{
    472.28,474.52
     It gets swollen up toes and foot here.
},
{
    474.52,476.24
     It creates like a tourniquet here.
},
{
    476.24,478.08
     So instead of helping, it actually makes it worse.
},
{
    478.08,478.92
     Right.
},
{
    478.92,480.24
     It absolutely can.
},
{
    480.24,482.48
     You were gonna show the tourniquet effect too, weren't you?
},
{
    482.48,483.44
     Right, exactly.
},
{
    483.44,485.8
     And actually, I'll do one more thing before that.
},
{
    485.8,487.96
     One thing I've learned is if you get two fingers
},
{
    487.96,488.8
     under there easily.
},
{
    488.8,489.64
     Oh yes.
},
{
    489.64,492.08
     You know, if you gotta fight to get your fingers under there,
},
{
    492.08,493.0
     it's too tight.
},
{
    494.08,495.44
     So that's one little thing.
},
{
    495.44,499.32
     Again, it's encouraging you to push it up into the body.
},
{
    499.32,500.64
     Right.
},
{
    500.64,503.68
     Liz, you may wanna zoom in on this.
},
{
    503.68,506.14
     A lot of times, especially with the tuber grip,
},
{
    506.14,509.3
     you have to be careful, it rolls down like this.
},
{
    509.3,510.94
     And you can see that'll create
},
{
    510.94,513.82
     what we call a tourniquet effect right around here.
},
{
    513.82,515.2
     Now, if you have a lot of fluid
},
{
    515.2,517.42
     and that's on there for like a half an hour
},
{
    517.42,521.42
     and you roll this down, you'll see a noticeable indent
},
{
    521.42,524.0
     right around the skin, all the way around.
},
{
    524.0,525.32
     And that's a tourniquet.
},
{
    525.32,527.76
     It will not allow the fluid to come forward.
},
{
    527.76,530.24
     It's actually causing harm.
},
{
    530.24,532.28
     I've seen it on Ted stockings a lot too.
},
{
    532.28,533.12
     Oh, sure.
},
{
    533.12,534.96
     The white stockings that you see,
},
{
    534.96,536.28
     and people, you pull them down
},
{
    536.28,538.56
     and like they got the big line there.
},
{
    538.56,540.72
     It's like, those things aren't helping them.
},
{
    540.72,541.56
     You know, they-
},
{
    541.56,542.4
     Exactly.
},
{
    542.4,543.24
     So.
},
{
    543.24,544.72
     So tuba grips, really good way,
},
{
    544.72,546.4
     particularly for short term. They do, they- Exactly. So tuber grips, really good way, particularly for short term.
},
{
    547.2,549.8
     They do to make compression stocks.
},
{
    549.8,553.64
     And actually, this is kind of a sporty looking one.
},
{
    553.64,555.8
     People who are runners and have athletes,
},
{
    555.8,557.2
     they actually use those for better circulation.
},
{
    557.2,558.84
     Yeah, they're starting to use them too for now.
},
{
    558.84,561.52
     There's some studies showing that's beneficial.
},
{
    561.52,562.36
     You can use them.
},
{
    562.36,564.24
     I know my, I got one from my mother.
},
{
    564.24,567.08
     Now these are more difficult to put on than the tuberculosis.
},
{
    567.08,570.72
     Both my mother and father, they didn't like these
},
{
    570.72,573.24
     because they were too hard for them to get on.
},
{
    573.24,575.76
     But I got one on this leg.
},
{
    575.76,580.08
     Now these are like 20 millimeters of pressure down here
},
{
    580.08,582.24
     and it actually releases and gets looser up here,
},
{
    582.24,583.08
     which is good.
},
{
    583.08,583.92
     Right.
},
{
    583.92,585.24
     Helps that flow going up.
},
{
    585.24,586.76
     And these got a nice,
},
{
    588.2,589.56
     the materials nice up here,
},
{
    589.56,591.0
     so it doesn't want to turn a kit.
},
{
    591.0,593.16
     Yep, exactly.
},
{
    593.16,596.16
     And the thing is you can get custom socks too.
},
{
    596.16,597.64
     That they actually take measurements
},
{
    597.64,599.84
     at your ankle, calf, and all that.
},
{
    599.84,601.32
     And then they fit you up,
},
{
    601.32,603.92
     but they also are difficult to put on.
},
{
    603.92,605.28
     People always have trouble with it.
},
{
    605.28,607.44
     Exactly, so it depends on the person.
},
{
    607.44,609.64
     If you're elderly or you have problems reaching down
},
{
    609.64,611.28
     to do that, you may need some help.
},
{
    611.28,612.48
     You may have to have someone that puts them
},
{
    612.48,613.44
     up for you everywhere.
},
{
    613.44,617.32
     Right, so again, if you're young and healthy
},
{
    617.32,619.88
     and you got an ankle sprain, you may not,
},
{
    619.88,623.0
     probably won't need a doctor's prescription
},
{
    623.0,624.32
     to do some of this.
},
{
    624.32,626.48
     It's more of the people that have compromised problems
},
{
    626.48,627.32
     with their heart.
},
{
    627.32,629.44
     Usually elderly people is pretty common with.
},
{
    629.44,630.6
     Then you want to get it checked out.
},
{
    630.6,631.76
     Exactly.
},
{
    631.76,636.76
     Also, if you have skin, open wounds, any skin problems,
},
{
    637.2,639.28
     you got to be really careful with that.
},
{
    640.2,643.56
     And the problem is sometimes swelling creates open wounds.
},
{
    643.56,644.4
     Yeah.
},
{
    644.4,646.72
     The viability of the skin becomes less.
},
{
    646.72,650.16
     You get weeping, it's straight.
},
{
    650.16,652.48
     Crazy how much water you can get out of the leg.
},
{
    652.48,655.56
     Yeah, I mean, both, we've seen where people
},
{
    655.56,658.0
     get so much fluid, the skin is tight,
},
{
    658.0,660.54
     the hair actually falls off, it's shiny.
},
{
    660.54,662.84
     If you're at that level, you need to see a doctor.
},
{
    662.84,663.88
     Yeah, you need some guidance.
},
{
    663.88,666.82
     You do, because that fluid can actually go right
},
{
    666.82,668.68
     through the skin and it gets wet.
},
{
    668.68,669.52
     Yes.
},
{
    669.52,671.6
     It's not healthy at all.
},
{
    671.6,673.04
     We do have one more option, Bob.
},
{
    673.04,675.0
     I want to bring up is the-
},
{
    675.0,675.84
     You want to bring it over to you?
},
{
    675.84,677.2
     Yeah, well, I'll bring it out.
},
{
    677.2,682.2
     Now this is something, if you're not too seriously involved
},
{
    682.28,686.76
     or you get okay from your doctor or therapist, you can just put your foot
},
{
    686.76,688.76
     in this foot massager.
},
{
    688.76,691.32
     The neat thing about this foot massager,
},
{
    691.32,695.2
     it blows up and it puts compression on while it massages.
},
{
    695.2,699.14
     So it gives you the same benefits
},
{
    699.14,701.96
     that the compression stockings or the tuba grip does.
},
{
    701.96,706.16
     Plus it offers massage to the bottom of the foot so it feels good.
},
{
    706.16,711.6
     Yeah, it feels really good and it's got different settings. I would say if you have a size foot
},
{
    712.24,718.32
     bigger than 12, larger than 12, it's probably too won't fit in here. Mine's at 12 and I'm
},
{
    719.2,724.72
     pretty much to the limit if I think 13 would be too much. We've used this on a number of patients
},
{
    722.52,725.0
     limit if I think 13 would be too much. We've used this on a number of patients
},
{
    725.0,727.92
     and they've ended up wanting one for at home.
},
{
    727.92,729.72
     Yeah, haven't found anybody yet
},
{
    729.72,730.88
     that hasn't loved this thing.
},
{
    730.88,733.32
     I mean seriously, but I'm sure the day's gonna come.
},
{
    733.32,734.52
     Sure, but...
},
{
    734.52,736.6
     It's adjustable, it's how much pressure
},
{
    736.6,739.9
     and how much massage goes on there.
},
{
    739.9,741.52
     Works well for neuropathy too.
},
{
    741.52,742.92
     Sure, sure.
},
{
    742.92,745.0
     My office manager loves it for that.
},
{
    745.0,748.68
     Make sure that the doctor is fine with you using
},
{
    748.68,750.68
     some compression garment or like this.
},
{
    750.68,752.44
     If they're fine with the compression garment,
},
{
    752.44,754.0
     they should be fine with this.
},
{
    754.0,756.32
     Right, and it's a good thing.
},
{
    756.32,758.16
     We're getting a little bit off on a tangent here,
},
{
    758.16,760.32
     but it's actually good just for foot pain too.
},
{
    760.32,761.16
     Sure, yep.
},
{
    761.16,762.0
     It just works out well for that.
},
{
    762.0,762.84
     Good for circulation.
},
{
    762.84,763.66
     She's squeezing.
},
{
    763.66,765.24
     Be careful, Bob.
},
{
    765.24,767.92
     All right, Bob, once again, we continue to,
},
{
    767.92,769.84
     now this is related to the heart, you know?
},
{
    769.84,771.36
     We can fix just about anything.
},
{
    771.36,772.28
     Except for.
},
{
    772.28,773.12
     Broken heart.
},
{
    773.12,773.96
     There you go.
},
{
    773.96,775.52
     But we'll try to fix it.
},
{
    775.52,776.36
     We'll work on it.
},
{
    776.36,778.44
     I don't think these socks, well, we'll see.
},
{
    778.44,780.72
     Look at that baby, it stretches out.
},
{
    780.72,None
     All right, take care, thank you.
},
