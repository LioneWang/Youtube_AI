     Hi, I'm Judy Barr, yoga program manager for the Cleveland Clinic. Today we're
},
{
    6.56,11.28
     going to talk about tension in our neck and shoulders. We spend so much time
},
{
    11.28,16.52
     hunched over our computer, our devices, our desk, even at the dinner table, that
},
{
    16.52,20.72
     many times we put strain on our neck and shoulders, which can cause neck pain,
},
{
    20.72,29.0
     even headaches. I'm going to show you a few postures today that are really simple to do, any place, one or all of them,
},
{
    29.0,34.0
     to help relieve the tension, to open up your chest more so that you can breathe better,
},
{
    34.0,37.0
     and to think more clearly, to feel better with your back.
},
{
    37.0,44.0
     So the first one, very simple, and that's the beauty of these poses, is they're eloquently simple,
},
{
    44.0,48.4
     and they really affect a lot of our different muscle groups very effectively.
},
{
    48.4,53.6
     So the neck roll is we just drop our chin and we're just rolling from one side and dropping
},
{
    53.6,55.28
     down.
},
{
    55.28,60.36
     You might hear some popping and that's okay as long as there's no pain associated with
},
{
    60.36,62.36
     it.
},
{
    62.36,66.86
     Just rolling and coming back. The next are shoulder rolls and these
},
{
    66.86,71.22
     particularly really help to loosen the tight muscles in the front, the side, and
},
{
    71.22,75.9
     the back of our shoulders. So going and rolling along one way and then rolling
},
{
    75.9,80.82
     the other. These two poses alone can be really beneficial and not a bad idea to
},
{
    80.82,86.44
     do several times a day. The next pose we're going to do is called fan pose.
},
{
    86.44,90.28
     Move as far forward on the chair as you can, put your hands in the back of the chair, and
},
{
    90.28,96.52
     then just slide up as far as you can, leaning forward while still keeping your elbows straight.
},
{
    96.52,99.56
     If they're bent, you're not going to get the tendons in the shoulders that we're trying
},
{
    99.56,100.56
     to get.
},
{
    100.56,103.66
     So, pulling your shoulders back, it feels really good.
},
{
    103.66,107.0
     This one is especially good to do during the day while you're working at your computer.
},
{
    107.0,113.0
     And pulling your shoulders back, take a long breath in and exhale.
},
{
    113.0,115.0
     So you can really see the ribs moving.
},
{
    115.0,121.0
     And notice how much this opens the chest, which helps to counteract gravity.
},
{
    121.0,126.56
     Take a nice long breath in and coming back and down.
},
{
    126.56,130.68
     So the next pose we're going to do is primarily for your back.
},
{
    130.68,136.16
     The idea here is, is you cross your arm over your body that the weight of the arm is in
},
{
    136.16,137.4
     the supporting arm.
},
{
    137.4,140.04
     This way all the muscles in the back can relax.
},
{
    140.04,142.4
     So pull it over as far as it'll go.
},
{
    142.4,143.8
     Again, no pain in it.
},
{
    143.8,146.72
     You may even want to look towards the shoulder.
},
{
    146.72,148.64
     Take a big breath in.
},
{
    148.64,151.96
     You're feeling nice stretch back by your shoulder blade.
},
{
    151.96,153.56
     Really a big tension point.
},
{
    153.56,156.52
     Then take that same arm, and as if you're going to shake hands,
},
{
    156.52,158.0
     take it behind you.
},
{
    158.0,161.16
     And then bending from one side and a nice tall spine,
},
{
    161.16,164.56
     always lengthening, and over to the other.
},
{
    164.56,166.64
     This gets a big muscle that comes down our back
},
{
    166.64,168.26
     called the trapezius.
},
{
    168.26,170.58
     Doing the other side, same thing.
},
{
    170.58,173.18
     Weight of the arm, pull it away.
},
{
    173.18,174.78
     Look even slightly and pull.
},
{
    174.78,177.22
     You'll feel a nice stretch in that shoulder blade.
},
{
    177.22,179.06
     Take a breath.
},
{
    179.06,181.94
     And then as you exhale, bring it around.
},
{
    181.94,184.66
     Hold on or just put it back as far as you can.
},
{
    184.66,185.56
     And again again go side
},
{
    185.56,190.08
     to side. It's getting some edges of the muscles that get really tight in our back
},
{
    190.08,197.76
     when we sit. The last pose is called stir the pot and it's using gravity. Put your
},
{
    197.76,203.56
     elbow or your hand on your leg and let your arm just hang for a moment and then
},
{
    203.56,205.5
     just initiate a circle.
},
{
    205.5,208.5
     We call it stir this pot and you see why.
},
{
    208.5,211.5
     But it helps lubricate the joint and the shoulder.
},
{
    211.5,213.5
     And it actually helps you to understand
},
{
    213.5,216.0
     what it takes to release the tension too
},
{
    216.0,218.0
     by just letting it hang.
},
{
    218.0,221.5
     And then of course, you'll do it on both sides.
},
{
    225.84,230.12
     So the big piece about helping to relieve the tension in the neck and the shoulders would
},
{
    230.12,236.04
     be perhaps noticing it or making it a regular routine to do one or any of these poses during
},
{
    236.04,237.52
     the course of the day.
},
{
    237.52,241.8
     You'll see you'll feel better, you'll think clear, be able to breathe and have a more
},
{
    241.8,243.84
     productive and enjoyable day.
},
{
    243.84,244.24
     Thank you.
},
