     In this video, I'm going to show you how to fix morning lower back pain for good. Stay tuned.
},
{
    10.0,14.88
     Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a
},
{
    14.88,19.76
     lot of lower back pain, stiffness, tightness in the morning and need a quick fix, this is a video
},
{
    19.76,25.12
     that you're not going to want to miss. I'm going to go over easy, effective, lower back stretching exercises
},
{
    25.12,26.4
     that can give quick relief,
},
{
    26.4,28.66
     even in as little as 30 seconds.
},
{
    28.66,31.68
     As a bonus, these exercises can be done at home,
},
{
    31.68,33.24
     in bed, in the middle of the night.
},
{
    33.24,36.72
     They're really simple, easy, and again, very effective.
},
{
    36.72,38.4
     So let's get started and get rid of
},
{
    38.4,40.28
     that lower back pain right now.
},
{
    40.28,43.12
     This lower back exercise is called the corkscrew,
},
{
    43.12,44.92
     and it's a popular one with many
},
{
    44.92,47.84
     because it can end in a satisfying pop crack or
},
{
    48.44,52.84
     Self-release into the lower back. I'm going to start off on my back in bed
},
{
    52.92,58.68
     This is going to be a two-part exercise the first one being a beginners and then we're going to go over one
},
{
    58.68,63.82
     That's a little bit more advanced for the beginners. Let's just bend our knees keep our feet flat like this
},
{
    63.82,65.88
     Our arms are going to go straight up like this.
},
{
    65.88,68.48
     Just lock the fingers at the knuckles.
},
{
    68.48,72.68
     What I'm going to do is I'm going to turn my head and my upper body in one direction
},
{
    72.68,76.8
     as much as I can while my knees go in the opposite direction.
},
{
    76.8,80.64
     This will cause that corkscrew effect into the lower back.
},
{
    80.64,83.64
     Only go to the point where it's a comfortable stretch.
},
{
    83.64,87.44
     And once we hit that point, let's hold this for 15 to 20 seconds.
},
{
    87.44,90.32
     From there, come back up and take a breather.
},
{
    90.32,93.3
     And then just simply repeat on the other side.
},
{
    93.3,95.48
     Again, you might feel a pop or crack
},
{
    95.48,97.24
     into the lower back with this one.
},
{
    97.24,98.6
     It's completely normal.
},
{
    98.6,101.4
     It's just gases being released from the joints.
},
{
    101.4,104.96
     So you want to do this for three to five repetitions
},
{
    104.96,106.82
     on both sides.
},
{
    106.82,111.04
     For the more advanced one, let's go up to the edge of a bed.
},
{
    111.04,115.44
     Whatever side is closest to the edge, let's straighten the leg out like this.
},
{
    115.44,118.72
     The other leg is going to go at 90 degrees at the knee.
},
{
    118.72,122.26
     Let's take the hand on the side closest to the edge of the bed and grab on the outside
},
{
    122.26,123.26
     of the knee.
},
{
    123.26,126.88
     So in this case, it's my left hand grabbing on the outside of my right knee.
},
{
    126.88,128.68
     My right arm is going to go straight up
},
{
    128.68,130.28
     towards the ceiling like this.
},
{
    130.28,132.56
     I'm going to start off by just pulling my knee
},
{
    132.56,135.52
     downwards towards the floor off the edge of the bed.
},
{
    135.52,139.96
     And when you do this, it feels like a very, very good stretch.
},
{
    139.96,142.06
     So the second part, we're going to incorporate
},
{
    142.06,142.96
     that cork screw.
},
{
    142.96,145.16
     So I'm going to turn my upper body in my head
},
{
    145.16,148.6
     in the opposite direction as I pull down with my knee.
},
{
    148.6,150.4
     And this feels great.
},
{
    150.4,153.88
     Hold this position for 15 to 20 seconds.
},
{
    153.88,157.0
     From there, you're just going to relax, take a breather,
},
{
    157.0,159.6
     and then repeat this up to five times.
},
{
    159.6,162.6
     With each repetition, try to drive this knee down further
},
{
    162.6,169.0
     and try to rotate your upper body even further in the opposite direction to get a better stretch. And when you're
},
{
    169.0,173.2
     done on one side, always switch to the other to keep them both in balance. This
},
{
    173.2,176.88
     exercise is known as a modified clam shell and it's great because it's going
},
{
    176.88,180.92
     to focus a little bit more into the hips across the pelvis. Whatever side that
},
{
    180.92,184.32
     we're focusing on, let's have that side straight up towards the ceiling. So I'm
},
{
    184.32,188.16
     pretty much laying on my left side, My right hip is going straight up.
},
{
    188.16,192.44
     What I'm going to do is stabilize my upper body weight on my arm just like this.
},
{
    192.54,197.22
     My right hand is going to go onto the hip right here just for a little bit more stability.
},
{
    197.3,200.36
     First movement is very simple. We're going to keep the feet together.
},
{
    200.36,204.9
     I'm going to raise my right knee and try to rotate it back.
},
{
    204.9,205.2
     So I'm kind of lifting it up towards and try to rotate it back. So I'm
},
{
    205.2,209.04
     kind of lifting it up towards the ceiling and then going back with it. When
},
{
    209.04,213.32
     you do this, you're going to feel the glute buttocks, lower back, hip and leg
},
{
    213.32,217.56
     muscles really start to fire. So only go to your comfort level. Really challenge
},
{
    217.56,221.84
     yourself to try to drive that knee back as far as you can. Once we hit that point,
},
{
    221.84,225.46
     let's hold this for about 15 seconds. From there,
},
{
    225.46,229.62
     you're slowly going to come back down, take a breather, and repeat this three to
},
{
    229.62,233.44
     five times. With each repetition, challenge yourself to take that knee back even
},
{
    233.44,239.96
     further to get a better stretch into the lower back and hips. This is how we can
},
{
    239.96,243.9
     take it to the next level. Let's get back into that original position, but what
},
{
    243.9,248.0
     I'm going to do with this one is lift the foot up like this, and this is going to
},
{
    248.0,251.88
     cause a lot more rotation into the hips. So we're trying to drive that heel up
},
{
    251.88,257.22
     towards the ceiling as much as we can, and this is a great stretch. So hold this
},
{
    257.22,262.08
     for about five seconds, and then you're going to slowly bring the heel back down
},
{
    262.08,267.0
     towards the other heel. Try to aim for about three to five seconds.
},
{
    267.0,269.44
     And you're just going to repeat this right here
},
{
    269.44,271.4
     for about five repetitions.
},
{
    271.4,273.32
     Just go nice and slow with it.
},
{
    273.32,276.28
     Really focus on trying to activate those muscles
},
{
    276.28,279.68
     and get a lot more motion into the hip.
},
{
    279.68,281.12
     And once you're done on one side,
},
{
    281.12,284.08
     always switch to the other to keep them both in balance.
},
{
    284.08,289.84
     So a big cause of lower back tightness, stiffness, or even pain in the morning is because of
},
{
    289.84,294.16
     the SI joints or sacroiliac joints being tight and locked up.
},
{
    294.16,299.3
     So here is a good two-part process to help open them back up.
},
{
    299.3,301.8
     We just lay flat in bed on our back like this.
},
{
    301.8,304.36
     Let's take our knees, bend them at 90 degrees.
},
{
    304.36,308.02
     The movement from here is going to be very easy. I'm going to do kind of a gliding
},
{
    308.02,312.86
     motion like this, but I'm going to resist it with my hands. So let's take our left
},
{
    312.86,318.26
     hand, place it on the outside of that left knee. Let's take our right hand, place
},
{
    318.26,322.32
     it on the inside of the knee, and let's do that gliding motion, but I'm going to
},
{
    322.32,325.6
     resist against it with my hands. And when you do this, but I'm going to resist against it with my hands.
},
{
    325.6,330.76
     When you do this, you're really going to feel a lot of activation across the pelvis into
},
{
    330.76,333.0
     those SI joints.
},
{
    333.0,335.8
     Hold this for about five seconds comfortably.
},
{
    335.8,338.88
     Relax, and then repeat it on the other side.
},
{
    338.88,343.28
     You want to do this for five repetitions on both sides.
},
{
    343.28,346.38
     Again, you might get a pop or crack
},
{
    346.38,347.78
     into those SI joints.
},
{
    347.78,349.08
     That is completely normal.
},
{
    349.08,352.3
     It's just gases being released from the synovial fluid.
},
{
    352.3,355.4
     What we want to do next, and this is the second part,
},
{
    355.4,358.66
     is take our hands, place them on the outside of our knees.
},
{
    358.66,361.26
     Our knees are going to be bent roughly at 90 degrees.
},
{
    361.26,363.58
     I'm going to drive my knees outwards
},
{
    363.58,366.2
     but resist against it with my hands.
},
{
    366.2,371.76
     This creates a nice isometric exercise into those SI joints. Let's hold this for five
},
{
    371.76,377.8
     seconds. We're just going to relax, take a breather, and then repeat this five times.
},
{
    377.8,381.8
     For the next part, we're going to take our hands, put them together, and then place them
},
{
    381.8,389.92
     into our knees, and then squeeze in. I don't know if you heard it over the microphone, but I got a very good pop into my SI joint.
},
{
    389.92,392.32
     You just squeeze inwards into your hands.
},
{
    392.32,396.96
     If this does cause irritation to your hands, you can just use a rolled up towel instead.
},
{
    396.96,401.34
     Just squeeze in, hold for five seconds, relax, take a breather, and then repeat this for
},
{
    401.34,402.48
     five times.
},
{
    402.48,409.78
     With this lower back exercise, we're going to use traction or pulling motions to help open up the back and decompress the
},
{
    409.78,414.16
     spine that is take pressure out of the spinal discs. Let's start off on our
},
{
    414.16,418.0
     stomach and go right towards the edge of a bed. I'm just going to keep sliding
},
{
    418.0,423.46
     slowly forward like this until my upper body comes off and I can go right on my
},
{
    423.46,426.56
     elbows. What I'm going to do is just hold this position.
},
{
    426.56,428.76
     I'm going to tuck my chin towards my chest,
},
{
    428.76,431.26
     and really allow my lower body weight
},
{
    431.26,434.48
     to just be taken by gravity towards the floor.
},
{
    434.48,436.24
     And this feels like a very good stretch.
},
{
    436.24,438.22
     You should feel it pretty much from the lower back
},
{
    438.22,439.76
     going all the way down.
},
{
    439.76,442.18
     Hold this position for about 30 seconds,
},
{
    442.18,444.98
     but you can hold it longer if you feel comfortable.
},
{
    444.98,448.06
     45 seconds all the way up towards a couple minutes.
},
{
    448.06,452.4
     But if you need to take a breather, what you do is just push back with your hands and kind
},
{
    452.4,454.28
     of pull back with your legs.
},
{
    454.28,459.4
     But try to do about five repetitions of this and focus on just trying to let the lower
},
{
    459.4,464.5
     back relax as much as you can and let gravity do all of the hard work.
},
{
    464.5,466.62
     How we can take this one to the next level
},
{
    466.62,468.24
     is instead of going on our elbows,
},
{
    468.24,471.88
     let's stretch our arms out in front of us as much as we can.
},
{
    471.88,474.16
     Let's tuck the chin again towards the chest.
},
{
    474.16,476.88
     Use our fingers right here to pull forward
},
{
    476.88,479.36
     as much as you can and this really will help
},
{
    479.36,481.12
     intensify that stretch.
},
{
    481.12,483.04
     Only go to your comfort level.
},
{
    483.04,490.6
     I pretty much feel this one from my shoulder blades all the way down to my tailbone. But I just hold this one again for about 30 seconds.
},
{
    490.6,494.56
     But you can hold it for as long as you feel comfortable. How you can take this one to
},
{
    494.56,500.18
     even the next, next level is go towards one side with it. So I'm really bending towards
},
{
    500.18,504.66
     my right. When you do this, you're going to feel the muscles in the lower back get activated
},
{
    504.66,506.32
     just a little bit differently. So experiment. Go all the way towards the right. When you do this, you're going to feel the muscles in the lower back get activated just a little bit differently.
},
{
    506.32,508.56
     So experiment, go all the way towards the right,
},
{
    508.56,510.52
     work your way over towards the left,
},
{
    510.52,512.76
     and notice that if one certain angle,
},
{
    512.76,516.32
     one certain spot hits it just a little bit better,
},
{
    516.32,517.74
     and make note of that,
},
{
    517.74,519.84
     just throw some more repetitions in there.
},
{
    519.84,521.16
     But you want to try to do this one
},
{
    521.16,523.26
     for about three to five repetitions,
},
{
    523.26,524.8
     challenging yourself to go forward
},
{
    524.8,526.44
     just a little bit more.
},
{
    526.44,531.36
     When you're done, you just push yourself back up like this, use your legs and your arms.
},
{
    531.36,537.72
     A big cause of lower back pain in the morning is because of muscle or soft tissue tightness.
},
{
    537.72,543.08
     Usually due to inactivity, think we've been just in a position for hours while sleeping.
},
{
    543.08,546.48
     Here is how we're going to tackle that with the $1 muscle fix.
},
{
    546.48,551.16
     I call it that because I'm going to be using a tennis ball, which is roughly $1.
},
{
    551.16,552.84
     Let's start off in bed.
},
{
    552.84,556.24
     I'm going to take the tennis ball and just place it off to one side.
},
{
    556.24,560.32
     With this one, you only want to go over the muscle around the spine.
},
{
    560.32,562.52
     Don't put it directly over the spine.
},
{
    562.52,566.4
     From there, let's focus on trying to take our lower back,
},
{
    566.4,567.9
     or I should say our body weight,
},
{
    567.9,570.1
     and driving it down into our lower back,
},
{
    570.1,571.8
     into the ball, into the bed.
},
{
    571.8,574.3
     And when you do this, it should really feel good
},
{
    574.3,577.2
     over the spot that is achy or tight.
},
{
    577.2,580.0
     What I want to do from there is just simple pelvic tilts.
},
{
    580.0,581.6
     I put my hands off to my side,
},
{
    581.6,585.28
     and I'm going to rock my pelvis up and down.
},
{
    585.28,589.52
     This will create a rolling motion over that tennis ball.
},
{
    589.52,594.84
     Try to just do this for about 5 to 10 repetitions and you can just switch it over different
},
{
    594.84,598.52
     spots as needed to target different areas.
},
{
    598.52,603.24
     But you just want to go pretty much across the lower back over any spot that you feel
},
{
    603.24,604.84
     is very tight and achy.
},
{
    604.84,608.08
     What you can also do from here is straighten one leg out,
},
{
    608.08,610.52
     and I have the ball a little bit over to my left side.
},
{
    610.52,611.92
     I'm going to grab that knee
},
{
    611.92,614.08
     and just do a simple knee to the chest.
},
{
    614.08,615.86
     When you do this, you're going to notice

     that this really activates over the area
},
{
    619.08,620.04
     that you have a tennis ball.
},
{
    620.04,621.28
     It becomes a lot more sensitive,
},
{
    621.28,623.24
     so only go to your comfort level.
},
{
    623.24,629.0
     You can hold this position right here for about 10 seconds and just relax and repeat
},
{
    629.0,633.92
     as needed up to five times or until that muscle tightness goes away.
},
{
    633.92,637.28
     And then from there, you can just switch to different spots and repeat.
},
{
    637.28,640.12
     You can also do more of a rotational component.
},
{
    640.12,644.04
     So I'm going to do that knee to the chest, but I'm just going to take the knee over like
},
{
    644.04,646.94
     this. And you'll notice that it activates the muscles
},
{
    646.94,648.04
     just a little bit differently,
},
{
    648.04,650.4
     so you'll be able to self massage a little bit more
},
{
    650.4,653.6
     over that area to hopefully get a lot of tightness out.
},
{
    653.6,655.54
     But just put the ball over different spots
},
{
    655.54,657.6
     in the lower back, go through some different motions.
},
{
    657.6,659.64
     You know, the pelvic tilts, knee to the chest,
},
{
    659.64,660.76
     and then the rotational ones,
},
{
    660.76,662.28
     and take what is most effective
},
{
    662.28,664.88
     at getting rid of that lower back pain and tightness.
