     Hey everybody it's Dr. Jo and today I'm going to show you how to use a percussion massager or
},
{
    3.76,7.6
     some people call them massage guns for knee and leg pain. So let's get started.

    15.36,19.2
     Before we get started if you haven't already make sure and click on the subscribe button below
},
{
    19.2,28.56
     because it helps my channel grow. I'm going to use the Irelieve Wireless Procussion Massager and I'll talk a little bit more about it later. So let's get started.
},
{
    28.56,35.26
     So knee and leg pain often comes from tight and sore muscles. So the Procussion
},
{
    35.26,39.36
     Massagers are really great to help relieve that pain in the muscles and
},
{
    39.36,43.12
     it's really nice because Procussion Massagers get deeper into the muscle
},
{
    43.12,48.92
     tissue so it's really like a deep massage and research shows that it's actually just
},
{
    48.92,53.56
     as beneficial or sometimes more beneficial than a traditional massage.
},
{
    53.56,54.68
     So with knee pain,
},
{
    54.68,58.48
     a lot of times the muscles that are causing some of that knee pain are the ones
},
{
    58.48,61.48
     that either cross the knee or the ones that come up to the knee.
},
{
    61.48,64.84
     So the quad muscle is usually a big one.
},
{
    64.84,68.12
     The IT band that starts up at the tensor fascia lata or the ones that come up to the knee. So the quad muscle is usually a big one. The IT band that starts up at the tensor fascia lata,
},
{
    68.12,71.8
     or the TFL, the hamstrings in the back,
},
{
    71.8,74.64
     the calf muscles, those cross as well.
},
{
    74.64,77.36
     And then sometimes even the anterior tibialis,
},
{
    77.36,78.68
     that doesn't actually cross the joint,
},
{
    78.68,81.14
     but it comes up to the knee and has a lot to do with it.
},
{
    81.14,84.16
     So it's really nice to get these muscles worked out,
},
{
    84.16,90.32
     especially if you have something like shin splints or you know just a tight quad you might have those are the kind of
},
{
    90.32,94.48
     things that will really help. So with this percussion massager I really like it because
},
{
    94.48,101.04
     it's not super loud and it also has three settings. You hold down the button and it starts so you can
},
{
    101.04,106.28
     see here that it has that kind of pushing motion. And you can see it's pretty interesting
},
{
    106.28,109.08
     because it makes that vibration going on.
},
{
    109.08,111.32
     But when you're using a percussion massager,
},
{
    111.32,113.8
     you don't wanna push down super hard.
},
{
    113.8,117.04
     You really wanna just start getting the muscle loosened up.
},
{
    117.04,118.96
     I'd start off on the lowest setting
},
{
    118.96,122.36
     and then kind of come around to where the muscle starts
},
{
    122.36,124.92
     to attach where the tendon is here.
},
{
    124.92,126.24
     You can come over to
},
{
    126.24,132.8
     the IT band, move all the way up. You can do it over your clothes. You don't have to do it directly
},
{
    132.8,136.32
     on the skin, but a lot of times it's going to feel a little bit better directly on the skin.
},
{
    136.32,142.88
     If you hit a bone, you can see it jumps a little bit differently. You don't particularly want that
},
{
    142.88,146.24
     to happen, but it's not, if as long as you don't stay on the bony, but it's not, as long as you don't stay on
},
{
    146.24,149.76
     the bony spot, it's not going to be that big of a deal, but it will be a little bit of
},
{
    149.76,151.16
     a different bump.
},
{
    151.16,155.16
     But also with this, you don't want to stay in one spot for too long.
},
{
    155.16,161.32
     So I wouldn't want to just sit here, especially if I was going up on a higher setting and
},
{
    161.32,165.72
     just sit there and hold it, because it might cause some extra soreness or maybe
},
{
    165.72,170.36
     even some bruising if you push down really hard. So you really want to kind of continuously
},
{
    170.36,176.4
     move with this. And there are some precautions of when you shouldn't use it, some obvious
},
{
    176.4,181.92
     ones. There shouldn't be scabbing or open wounds. You shouldn't do it over fractures,
},
{
    181.92,186.36
     that you know, active fractures that you have. So just make sure that you're reading the instructions,
},
{
    186.36,188.16
     getting clear by your doctor or physical therapist
},
{
    188.16,191.2
     to do this because this does go deeper into the tissue,
},
{
    191.2,193.28
     so it really does make a difference.
},
{
    193.28,195.72
     It's not just one of those light massage things
},
{
    195.72,196.8
     that you get from any store,
},
{
    196.8,200.24
     it is a deeper tissue kind of workout.
},
{
    200.24,204.24
     So with the Irelieve wireless percussion massager,
},
{
    204.24,206.22
     that's one of the biggest things that I really like about it.
},
{
    206.22,209.52
     It's wireless. You don't have this cord that you have to move around.
},
{
    209.52,212.06
     You can really get it all around your leg and your knee.
},
{
    212.06,215.22
     And that's a really nice component that I personally like.
},
{
    215.22,218.76
     It also has three different settings like I was talking about earlier.
},
{
    218.76,223.86
     So when you push it down, this is the lightest setting that you probably want to start off with.
},
{
    223.86,226.92
     Then it'll go a little bit quicker and then the
},
{
    227.36,234.06
     the third setting which is the strongest setting and so it's a lot quicker and you can kind of see it might
},
{
    234.06,238.52
     Would be fun to slow it down and show that movement of it going up and down it's actually
},
{
    239.14,243.9
     Pulsing into the tissue and so that quick movement of those
},
{
    247.92,255.12
     into the tissue and so that quick movement of those percussions really helps relax those muscles. So again if you're going into the calf here you really want to keep it moving. If you're
},
{
    255.12,259.76
     over on that area anterior tib you want to keep it moving. If you want to come up you can go kind
},
{
    259.76,265.92
     of like a sideways angled motion it doesn't have to be directly over it just to get those muscles.
},
{
    268.32,271.52
     And so again, not for a long period of time,
},
{
    271.52,273.86
     just start off with a little bit and build up to it.
},
{
    273.86,277.48
     But make sure that if you're getting extra soreness
},
{
    277.48,279.44
     that you're not just pushing through that.
},
{
    279.44,281.68
     It should be maybe slightly uncomfortable,
},
{
    281.68,283.84
     especially if you have some soreness and tightness in there,
},
{
    283.84,285.44
     but it really shouldn't be painful.
},
{
    285.64,289.96
     And again, people who like the research and like to know about research,
},
{
    290.12,295.52
     this also does the percussion massagers. Research shows that it really helps with doms,
},
{
    295.64,300.52
     which is delayed onset of muscle soreness, which is when sometimes we work out really hard,
},
{
    300.52,304.64
     especially if you haven't worked out for a long time, and you get that delayed onset where you're not really sore
},
{
    304.8,307.18
     right afterwards, but a day afterwards or
},
{
    307.18,311.6
     two days afterwards, you get that really, that lactic buildup in your muscles that makes
},
{
    311.6,312.6
     it really sore.
},
{
    312.6,313.8
     So this does a really good job of that.
},
{
    313.8,318.36
     And some studies even show that it's 30% better than a traditional massage.
},
{
    318.36,323.92
     So take it for what it is, do your own research, but I really do like this percussion massager
},
{
    323.92,330.56
     for getting that deep tissue massage in there there and it really helps relieve and relax those muscles and
},
{
    330.56,335.88
     increase the circulation in the area which helps with healing process and getting that
},
{
    335.88,338.72
     inflammation out of there if you have a little bit of inflammation.
},
{
    338.72,342.56
