     In this video, I'm going to show at-home spinal decompression stretches that can give instant

{
    5.04,10.24
     relief for bulging discs and pinched nerves in the lower back. Hi everyone, Dr. Rowe here at
},
{
    10.24,15.36
     SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. When it comes to the lumbar discs, those shock absorbers in the
},
{
    15.36,21.84
     lower back, it's all about pressure. The discs are built to withstand a lot of compression or up and
},
{
    21.84,25.76
     down forces throughout the day. However, just like a shock absorber on
},
{
    25.76,32.24
     a car, it can be overwhelmed through heart impacts. Think a heart fall, accident, sports injury, or
},
{
    32.24,37.76
     just gradually start to break down through repetitive wear and tear. Once the disc become damaged,
},
{
    37.76,42.72
     they tend to bulge or herniate since they cannot contain normal compressive forces.
},
{
    42.72,46.84
     The result of this is an outpouching disc or herniation
},
{
    46.84,50.36
     that will make contact with a nearby spinal nerve.
},
{
    50.36,53.42
     This is the classic cause of a pinched nerve.
},
{
    53.42,54.8
     So to unpinch the nerve,
},
{
    54.8,57.4
     we need to reduce the pressure in the disc
},
{
    57.4,59.92
     or simply decompress the disc.
},
{
    59.92,62.16
     You can imagine if there's a lot of downward force
},
{
    62.16,64.12
     being put on the disc causing compression,
},
{
    64.12,67.48
     it's going to pancake the disc and bulge it out.
},
{
    67.48,72.42
     If we do the opposite by pulling on it, it's going to relieve the pressure within the disc
},
{
    72.42,78.22
     and cause that bulging material to come back in, taking the bulge off that nerve.
},
{
    78.22,81.76
     And we're going to do that through pulling or traction based stretches.
},
{
    81.76,88.36
     How these stretches work are by using your own body weight and gravity to aid in getting the traction needed in the lower
},
{
    88.36,92.72
     back. You take the bulge off the nerve it will start to heal and you will feel a
},
{
    92.72,96.48
     lot less pain. The main thing that we're going to look for while doing these
},
{
    96.48,101.28
     stretches is less frequent and intense symptoms but more importantly what is
},
{
    101.28,109.52
     called centralization. Centralization is a fancy way of saying when you put pressure onto a nerve it will cause it to travel such as a sciatica
},
{
    109.52,113.88
     pain into the leg. When you take the pressure off the nerve the pain starts
},
{
    113.88,118.64
     to move back up to the starting point which would be in the low back. Nerve
},
{
    118.64,123.72
     pain heals by slowly moving back towards the starting point. So if you're feeling
},
{
    123.72,127.0
     less pain and the pain isn't traveling as far,
},
{
    127.0,128.76
     these stretches are working for you.
},
{
    128.76,130.36
     So let's get started with them
},
{
    130.36,132.3
     and get feeling better right now.
},
{
    132.3,133.4
     So for the first stretch,
},
{
    133.4,135.86
     you need to find two even surfaces.
},
{
    135.86,138.84
     In this case, I just found two cabinets of level height,
},
{
    138.84,141.88
     but you can substitute this by using chairs.
},
{
    141.88,144.48
     So just put two sturdy chairs on the side right here
},
{
    144.48,145.8
     that you're able to grab onto.
},
{
    145.8,150.32
     So with this stretch it's pretty straightforward. You're just going to grab onto the two ends right
},
{
    150.32,155.06
     here and stand up on your toes. Just kind of right on your tippy toes and then drop your
},
{
    155.06,160.52
     weight and support yourself with your arms. Just let the weight drop as much as you can. You don't
},
{
    160.52,165.0
     want to engage the core muscles, the low back. You want everything to relax.
},
{
    165.0,167.88
     That way the pressure is being taken straight down.
},
{
    167.88,171.96
     So again, tippy toes and just let the weight drop.
},
{
    171.96,177.2
     What this is doing is the gravity is pulling on the back, releasing that pressure within
},
{
    177.2,180.36
     the disc and at that point un-pinching the nerves.
},
{
    180.36,183.52
     So what I like to do with this is hold it for as long as you can.
},
{
    183.52,186.56
     15 to 30 seconds is a really good starting point.
},
{
    186.56,191.16
     If you just feel like you can't support yourself, build into it to your comfort level and do
},
{
    191.16,192.16
     it as much as you can.
},
{
    192.16,197.98
     But you want to do this a couple times throughout the day just to help decompress the back itself.
},
{
    197.98,202.92
     So another variation of this stretch would be to sit in a sturdy chair with two arms
},
{
    202.92,207.32
     and then go right to the edge of the chair, put your feet out and then
},
{
    207.68,214.6
     just simply lift yourself up while putting the bottom weight on your heels. With this one again,
},
{
    214.6,222.2
     just let everything relax in the core, the low back, and just let gravity take the weight down to help open up the
},
{
    222.2,225.32
     joint spaces in the back, relieving pressure off
},
{
    225.32,226.72
     the spinal disc.
},
{
    226.72,230.48
     So again, what I'm doing is I'm just lifting myself up like this, putting the weight on
},
{
    230.48,234.84
     my heels and just relaxing everything and letting gravity take it.
},
{
    234.84,238.76
     Hold this one for 15 to 30 seconds if you're able to.
},
{
    238.76,242.64
     Relax for a little bit in between and do it upwards to three to five times.
},
{
    242.64,246.28
     You can do this stretch throughout the day as long as you're seeing relief with it.
},
{
    246.28,248.84
     So this next stretch is very straightforward.
},
{
    248.84,251.8
     You just need a level surface such as a mattress,
},
{
    251.8,254.4
     couch, countertop, anything that's gonna be close
},
{
    254.4,255.52
     to hip level.
},
{
    255.52,257.8
     You're also going to want a pillow for comfort.
},
{
    257.8,259.48
     So to start with, what we're going to do
},
{
    259.48,261.88
     is put the pillow at the edge right here
},
{
    261.88,264.88
     and then just lying on it with our upper body weight.
},
{
    264.88,265.04
     Let the lower body weight just lying on it with our upper body weight.
},
{
    265.04,268.78
     Let the lower body weight just be taken down with gravity.
},
{
    268.78,273.36
     Just kind of use your toes right here to stabilize yourself and let everything relax.
},
{
    273.36,276.28
     Hold this position for about 15 to 30 seconds.
},
{
    276.28,279.88
     If you feel like you're able to hold it for longer, you're more than welcome to, especially
},
{
    279.88,280.88
     if you're feeling relieved.
},
{
    280.88,288.88
     But with this one, do it about three to five times with a little bit of a break in between. You can do these stretches throughout the day as long as you feel relieved.
},
{
    288.88,293.4
     If your pain is still lingering or getting worse, more sophisticated traction is going
},
{
    293.4,298.2
     to be needed to get relief. Look into spinal decompression therapy, which is one of the
},
{
    298.2,303.44
     best conservative options available that can help treat herniated discs and pinch nerves.
},
{
    303.44,308.48
     I use spinal decompression therapy in my office and have gotten great results with it and
},
{
    308.48,313.88
     I have helped a lot of people get long lasting relief without the use of drugs, injections
},
{
    313.88,314.88
     or surgery.
},
{
    314.88,318.12
     So I hope these stretches helped you out and you're already getting some relief.
