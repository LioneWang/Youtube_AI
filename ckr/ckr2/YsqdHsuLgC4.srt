     Hi and welcome back to Physiotutors. You are probably familiar with the pop-eye sign that's

     a characteristic for proximal ruptures of the long head of the biceps tendon.

{
    26.74,30.74
     But what may be a clinical sign of injury to the distal biceps tendon?

     Audriska Dahl from 2007 proposed the hook test and report a sensitivity and specificity

     of both 100% in their diagnostic cohort study.

    41.22,47.36
     De Verhoed Dahl from 2013 could replicate the specificity of 100% but report a slightly

     lower sensitivity of 81%. While the sample sizes were rather small in both studies at

     45 patients each, the sound reference standard and setup plus the findings give it a high

     clinical value in our opinion. To conduct the test, the patient is either standing or sitting.

     To conduct the test, the patient is either standing or sitting. Then the patient is asked to actively flex the elbow to 90 degrees and to fully supinate

     the forearm.

     In case of the right elbow, use your left index finger and try to hook it under the

     biceps tendon by bringing it in laterally of the anti-cubital fossa.
},
{
    82.6,86.32
     In a normal tendon, you should be able to hook your finger under

{
    86.32,92.92
     the tendon, approximately 1 cm, or even until the distal interphalangeal joint, and be able

{
    92.92,95.4
     to pull it forward vigorously.
},
{
    95.4,107.64
     If the distal biceps tendon is evolved, you won't be able to hook your index finger under the tendon, which indicates a positive test.
},
{
    107.64,112.92
     In a second scenario, pain may be elicited when pulling the intact tendon forward, which

{
    112.92,118.12
     may suggest a partial tear or other injury of the tendon or sheath.
