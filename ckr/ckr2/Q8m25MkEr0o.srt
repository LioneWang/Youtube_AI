     Hi everyone, I hope you guys are doing really well.
},
{
    9.64,14.16
     Today I would like to share with you a mobility routine for a whole body.
},
{
    14.16,19.28
     You can do this routine pretty much at home with no much equipment.
},
{
    19.28,22.88
     If you never been on our channel, my name is Bob, I'm a physical therapist.
},
{
    22.88,30.02
     I help people with simple tips and exercises to recover and get back to the routine. If you never subscribe our
},
{
    30.02,36.44
     channel make sure to subscribe for a weekly update. Let's get started!
},
{
    38.68,42.26
     Before I start this routine with you guys I would like to share with you a
},
{
    42.26,49.24
     couple of things that it can help you. Do not compare yourself with anybody when you do the stretches. Start slowly
},
{
    49.24,54.78
     and gradually and build up your range slowly. If you find any of the exercise doesn't feel
},
{
    54.78,59.92
     comfortable try to avoid them, maybe try the others or maybe do them gently and slowly
},
{
    59.92,66.52
     build up. You will need a towel, average size not too big and we're going to use
},
{
    66.52,71.68
     this towel to this routine. At the same time whenever you're doing any of the
},
{
    71.68,76.72
     exercises make sure to breathe in and out and do not hold your breath. Let's start
},
{
    76.72,80.94
     with the first exercise that is neck stretch and I'm going to move on to them
},
{
    80.94,85.12
     one by one. You can do seated or be on the chair, that's
},
{
    85.12,88.96
     totally your choice but because we're gonna do a couple of routine on the floor
},
{
    88.96,93.72
     I decided to start with the floor and we can move on. Now we're gonna start with
},
{
    93.72,98.8
     the gentle stretch of the neck which is kind of like we start with the five
},
{
    98.8,107.74
     stretch. I'm just simply relaxing my arms on top of my neck and I'm holding my back
},
{
    107.74,115.3
     relaxed and I let my neck to drop. I focus on my breathing, breathing and
},
{
    115.3,125.2
     out. I can feel a great stretch on the side of my neck. As you can see, my neck is not just down,
},
{
    125.2,130.2
     I rotate it to the right and relax my arms here
},
{
    130.36,133.8
     and I let my arms to drop my neck down.
},
{
    135.92,137.08
     I'm breathing in and out.
},
{
    140.12,142.12
     As I'm breathing in and out,
},
{
    142.12,144.6
     I let my arm to drop down more.
},
{
    146.0,149.44
     I can feel a good stretch even around my upper traps.
},
{
    150.64,154.96
     I can hold this for 15 to 20 seconds. I change sides.
},
{
    159.6,160.4
     Hold there.
},
{
    162.0,165.12
     there.
},
{
    167.12,176.12
     Great even out.
},
{
    181.38,187.06
     Same thing. I feel a great stretch there and I can hold it for 10 to 15 seconds. Depends on the time that you would like to spend on your stretches, guys. You can do them for two to three sets.
},
{
    187.06,189.84
     Now, we're gonna move the same exercise.
},
{
    189.84,193.16
     And we're gonna move it arms to the side of the neck.
},
{
    193.16,196.18
     And we're gonna go for side stretch.
},
{
    196.18,198.36
     That was more kind of like going down.
},
{
    198.36,200.8
     This is more towards the side.
},
{
    200.8,202.8
     And again, I don't push it too much.
},
{
    202.8,206.24
     I let my arms to drop and I feel it now
},
{
    206.24,211.6
     more on my side of my neck just hold there
},
{
    213.44,216.56
     breathing out
},
{
    218.96,231.2
     try the same thing for the other side.
},
{
    234.32,237.46
     This routine can be really helpful if you find your neck is stiff.
},
{
    239.08,242.44
     You can definitely use this exercises daily,
},
{
    242.44,245.92
     couple of times, and sometimes for neck pain I find out
},
{
    245.92,252.32
     strengthening your neck can be a really useful. I have a video on my channel how
},
{
    252.32,256.44
     to strengthen your neck with resistance band make sure to check it out it's
},
{
    256.44,262.28
     pretty simple it's really effective. Now from there you're gonna use the towel
},
{
    262.28,266.28
     I'm gonna show you how to stretch your neck.
},
{
    266.28,269.48
     With a towel, simply you're holding one side
},
{
    269.48,272.24
     and you're grabbing the other side and you rotate
},
{
    274.56,275.48
     with the towel.
},
{
    278.56,280.8
     Hold it there for 10 to 15 seconds.
},
{
    284.32,295.28
     Relax. Trying to the other side. I'm kind of rotating my neck. With the help
},
{
    295.28,310.64
     of towel I get more control on it. It doesn't push too much. I show you one around on the other side. You're gonna
},
{
    310.64,320.72
     bring the towel around your neck and your head and holding it there for 15 to
},
{
    320.72,325.0
     20 seconds. It's kind of way more supported
},
{
    325.0,328.28
     in comparison just using your arms.
},
{
    328.28,330.46
     And try the other side.
},
{
    337.6,340.32
     10 to 15 seconds, make sure you're breathing.
},
{
    342.24,343.84
     And breathe out.
},
{
    349.8,352.84
     We're gonna move on to shoulder stretch, which is pretty straightforward. We're going to go with two different movements.
},
{
    352.84,358.76
     We're going to bring the arms overhead and hold it there.
},
{
    358.76,362.6
     Just work around your own range, see how far you can go up.
},
{
    362.6,367.64
     Hold it there for 10, 15 seconds. If you even run it up to here,
},
{
    367.64,373.84
     that's totally fine. These arms basically help you to give you more stretch around the
},
{
    373.84,388.72
     back of your arms as well. Hold it there, breathing in and out. Try to relax the back, change arms, bring this here
},
{
    395.28,400.32
     and breathe out. If you find you want to make it a little bit more, get tension, you can stretch even the side of your lats, you can bring the arms to the side.
},
{
    404.8,411.12
     Hold there for 10-15 seconds and show it from the other side. Hold there for 10-15 seconds and show from other side. You might find one side is
},
{
    411.12,418.96
     easier to actually stretch it. That's pretty normal. And doing this couple of rounds, hold
},
{
    418.96,426.08
     for 10-15 seconds, then I'm going to bring my arms back back and just basically getting that movement back.
},
{
    426.08,429.88
     It helps you to stretch and mobilize your shoulder joint.
},
{
    429.88,433.64
     I'm gonna hold it there for 10-15 seconds.
},
{
    433.64,437.76
     Sometimes you can even check, can you catch your other arms?
},
{
    437.76,439.26
     I can't.
},
{
    439.26,442.64
     As I told you, my mobility is not as good as you think.
},
{
    442.64,449.68
     You can try the other side. Hold it there for 10-15 seconds.
},
{
    449.68,457.6
     If you struggle with any shoulder injury, make sure that you don't force this exercise. Try to
},
{
    457.6,472.44
     work around your own range. Go even up to here. You're still going to feel the good stretch up to here you're still gonna feel the stretch now try to just move on your shoulder internally externally
},
{
    472.44,477.8
     you're gonna go for internal external rotation of the shoulder and relax the
},
{
    477.8,484.8
     back external rotation forward
},
{
    494.84,505.0
     and rotate, go forward, breathe in, breathe out, stay there, it's going to stretch up and back and the shoulders as well, head down, breathe in, rotate the arms,
},
{
    505.92,509.04
     and internal rotate it back forward.
},
{
    509.04,511.72
     You can stay there for 10 seconds.
},
{
    516.56,518.0
     Go for a couple of breathing.
},
{
    519.96,524.68
     And back again, you can combine this movement.
},
{
    524.68,527.44
     If you find this is easy,
},
{
    527.44,529.2
     you'll like to make it a little more challenging.
},
{
    529.2,532.4
     You can try this with squat
},
{
    532.4,534.32
     and external internal rotation.
},
{
    534.32,537.36
     I'm gonna show you at the end how you can add on that.
},
{
    537.36,542.36
     From here, we're gonna go to quadruped position,
},
{
    544.0,547.48
     which is kind of like you're trying to move the upper back and
},
{
    547.48,556.68
     lower back. Now we're gonna go for cat camel. I've shown this exercise a couple
},
{
    556.68,567.32
     of times in my other videos. It's a very simple but effective movement to keep your upper body and lower body moved.
},
{
    567.32,571.64
     Make sure breathing.
},
{
    571.64,574.52
     Relax the upper back and lower back.
},
{
    574.52,580.4
     Now you're stretching it all the way up.
},
{
    580.4,589.92
     Move around and back down again. Let's go home around. You can hold there for five seconds.
},
{
    591.04,600.0
     Four, three, two, and relax. Now from here I'm going to show you a
},
{
    600.0,605.0
     trussic rotation which is a new movement that you can try.
},
{
    605.0,608.48
     I'll show you two different variations.
},
{
    608.48,615.44
     You could get a crack easily on your back, which is fine.
},
{
    615.44,620.56
     As you can see, I'm moving my whole body, rotating it inside.
},
{
    620.56,624.2
     And my neck moves with my back as well, with my arms.
},
{
    624.2,625.32
     I'm going to show you from the other side.
},
{
    627.48,630.28
     Bringing this in and all the way back up.
},
{
    631.32,637.72
     It's definitely feeling challenging. I feel the whole stretch around my hip even and my lower back.
},
{
    638.28,640.28
     You can try this for
},
{
    640.6,642.6
     three sets of five.
},
{
    643.12,649.12
     Each side work on your own range, be patient. I find
},
{
    649.12,654.64
     breathing in this exercise can be pretty challenging due to that rotation but
},
{
    654.64,661.2
     just work around it. From here if you use a towel there it can be actually easy
},
{
    661.2,666.02
     for your foot sometimes fine foot can be pretty
},
{
    666.02,680.48
     stiff to see on it. We're going to go to child pose, relax your back, breathe in, breathe out,
},
{
    681.98,689.28
     hold it there as far as you like, 10-15 seconds, breathe in and out.
},
{
    689.28,696.56
     You can bring the opposite arms now to the right.
},
{
    696.56,697.56
     Hold it there.
},
{
    697.56,702.28
     You get a great stretch on your shoulder and even your lower back, dear to the rotation.
},
{
    702.28,708.0
     If you want to make it more challenging, you can bring these arms to the opposite side
},
{
    708.0,709.0
     as well.
},
{
    709.0,712.68
     Now, breathing in and out.
},
{
    712.68,714.12
     Don't keep my hip.
},
{
    714.12,715.12
     Relax my hip.
},
{
    715.12,721.6
     I'll come back to the center.
},
{
    721.6,722.6
     Relax shortly.
},
{
    722.6,726.96
     You could probably put something under your knees guys if you find the mat is not as thick.
},
{
    727.08,729.56
     That can help you to get more cushion.
},
{
    730.8,733.04
     Bring it forward there to the other side.
},
{
    735.2,737.2
     Bring it in and out.
},
{
    739.92,741.92
     Left arm as well.
},
{
    743.76,745.76
     Right out.
},
{
    746.04,753.44
     As I mentioned earlier, you can practice these for a couple of rounds of, let's say three to four rounds.
},
{
    754.04,756.96
     And hold them there for 10-15 seconds, depends on your time.
},
{
    759.0,761.0
     From here we're gonna go back to
},
{
    763.28,765.0
     hip flexor stretch.
},
{
    765.74,768.66
     I suppose I've shown you this exercise before.
},
{
    768.66,772.02
     You can try it in this routine too.
},
{
    772.02,773.34
     It's a great hip opener.
},
{
    774.7,777.94
     You can bring this arm up as well.
},
{
    777.94,780.98
     Get the side of the hip stretch as well.
},
{
    783.7,788.24
     Breathe in and out. You're trying to basically bring the opposite foot forward.
},
{
    788.24,805.16
     You're changing side.
},
{
    807.16,808.22
     And move forward.
},
{
    810.7,814.88
     And rotate it to the side.
},
{
    818.86,819.98
     You can try this for three rounds. Now from here
},
{
    821.98,822.56
     I'm gonna move to
},
{
    826.8,829.24
     how can we stretch the quads you can lie on your side and
},
{
    831.24,831.32
     hold
},
{
    832.72,834.72
     one of the ties from there and
},
{
    834.96,836.96
     If you find it's comfortable
},
{
    837.32,840.88
     You can bring it a little bit more back this more kind of for quarter steps
},
{
    841.8,843.8
     the front of the ties
},
{
    843.84,848.08
     more than hip flexor if you can like
},
{
    848.08,855.8
     hyper extend the hip you can get a bit of hip flexor stretch as well but I
},
{
    855.8,869.52
     feel it more on my thighs I turn to the other side Press the same thing. Hold it there for 10-15 seconds.
},
{
    869.52,876.4
     A couple of rounds. Don't be afraid if you want to move it. You can move a little bit back or
},
{
    876.4,881.28
     bring a little bit more forward if you feel uncomfortable. You shouldn't let it get all the
},
{
    881.28,886.0
     way back. Sometimes even you might need a system with the towel.
},
{
    886.0,893.76
     If you find it's very difficult to hold your foot you can use the towel and bring it like
},
{
    893.76,906.72
     that back to get stretch as far as you can. Now we're gonna go back to on your back and we're going to stretch the hamstring. I'm going to show
},
{
    906.72,916.0
     you a assisted moment with the towel. You can lie on your back. If you find it's comfortable,
},
{
    916.0,922.4
     you can straighten the knee. Otherwise, bend the knees. It's fine. You still feel the hamstring.
},
{
    922.4,930.16
     I feel the hamstring stretch already. You don't want to go for a very tight and forceful stretch as long as you're finding the stretch.
},
{
    931.36,935.28
     You can feel it, you can hold it there, focus on your breathing, breathing it out.
},
{
    937.72,939.72
     If you find it, it's giving you some
},
{
    941.32,944.2
     basically space. You can move a little bit more forward.
},
{
    950.04,956.36
     If you put more up, I can feel it more on my lower hamstring. It's a great stretch because you can actually relax and let your body actually to give you
},
{
    956.36,958.36
     some space.
},
{
    958.36,968.0
     You can bend the knees again, bring it a little bit more forward for upper hamstring.
},
{
    968.0,972.6
     Change legs.
},
{
    972.6,975.72
     Black stop as you foot.
},
{
    975.72,977.72
     All the way back.
},
{
    977.72,990.0
     To find it easy, you can it a little bit more back.
},
{
    990.0,999.52
     Hold there for 10, 15, 20 seconds and you can practice this for 2 to 3 times.
},
{
    999.52,1002.0
     I'm going to put the towels here.
},
{
    1002.0,1005.0
     We're going to go for hip stretch from there.
},
{
    1005.0,1010.0
     In this position you can save time and hip stretch.
},
{
    1010.0,1012.0
     It doesn't have any specific rhythm.
},
{
    1012.0,1016.0
     You can work around the position that you feel it's stiffer.
},
{
    1016.0,1018.0
     You can bring it to the side.
},
{
    1018.0,1020.0
     You can bring it inside.
},
{
    1020.0,1022.0
     I find this, it's really helpful.
},
{
    1022.0,1025.6
     If you find the hip and the glutes are tight.
},
{
    1030.4,1031.84
     You can twist it a little bit up and rotate it to the opposite side,
},
{
    1038.72,1040.0
     breathing in and out. Hold there for 10-15 seconds, change legs. See the opposite leg is always relaxed.
},
{
    1042.16,1044.08
     I find this side is definitely more stiff.
},
{
    1048.56,1051.28
     Hold there, I can already feel it. I focus on my breathing.
},
{
    1056.4,1058.16
     10 to 20 seconds. You can practice it two or three times.
},
{
    1061.92,1068.4
     If you bring it more towards the side, you can get even labor for lower back stretch, which is great. From there, I'm going to stretch
},
{
    1068.4,1075.6
     the doctors, which is kind of like sometimes you could be around here, but don't worry about
},
{
    1075.6,1080.88
     it. This stretch, you're kind of like trying to really play with it. And then with your
},
{
    1080.88,1085.6
     elbows, you can push it down, relax your back.
},
{
    1085.6,1090.24
     It's a very strong muscle but at the same time it's very tight.
},
{
    1090.24,1096.56
     It's a group of muscle that basically the inner ties and your groin muscle.
},
{
    1096.56,1099.64
     Breathing in and out.
},
{
    1099.64,1101.36
     Push it down.
},
{
    1101.36,1104.36
     Slightly work around your range.
},
{
    1104.36,1105.0
     Don't rush it.
},
{
    1106.82,1111.82
     And practice this again for two to three times, guys.
},
{
    1115.38,1116.7
     To finish this routine, guys,
},
{
    1116.7,1118.92
     I would like to share with you this beating routine
},
{
    1118.92,1122.08
     that I always use in my relaxation and my stretches
},
{
    1122.08,1124.0
     and my mobility routine.
},
{
    1124.0,1126.6
     I'm gonna show you how to do it and you can give it a try.
},
{
    1126.6,1130.74
     We try to use our diaphragm, which is a muscle
},
{
    1130.74,1133.68
     underneath of our bridge cage,
},
{
    1133.68,1136.8
     to be used more than our upper chest muscle.
},
{
    1136.8,1139.8
     These are like your secondary muscle group
},
{
    1139.8,1142.96
     of your for breeding, which we use them more often now.
},
{
    1142.96,1149.92
     And that could cause a lot of neck and upper back and shoulder stiffness. Let's give it a try. You're gonna
},
{
    1149.92,1156.76
     lie down on your back, you can use a towel or something to support your neck or if
},
{
    1156.76,1163.52
     you feel comfortable without that. We try to literally hold one hand on our chest
},
{
    1163.52,1166.24
     and one hand on our belly and we try to take a one hand on our chest and one hand on our belly.
},
{
    1166.24,1169.9
     And we try to take a deep breath through our nose.
},
{
    1172.76,1176.0
     And breathe out.
},
{
    1176.0,1178.2
     Now in most of the cases,
},
{
    1178.2,1179.56
     then we take a deep breathing.
},
{
    1179.56,1181.2
     The first part that goes up,
},
{
    1181.2,1183.44
     it can be your upper chest
},
{
    1183.44,1186.72
     and you can see actually using your neck muscle as well.
},
{
    1186.72,1195.44
     Now we try to retrain our breathing and try to help our dog frog which is basically around
},
{
    1195.44,1199.92
     on the knees of your rib cage to the movement.
},
{
    1203.52,1204.96
     You're gonna breathe through your nose.
},
{
    1209.04,1214.2
     You're gonna breathe through your nose. Get that movement there.
},
{
    1214.2,1232.84
     As you can see when I breathe out, breathe out through my mouth andf Rock. Practice from around.
},
{
    1239.72,1244.78
     Now when you start to doing these routine guys you're definitely gonna find it
},
{
    1244.78,1245.36
     very difficult
},
{
    1245.36,1247.12
     to not move in your chest.
},
{
    1247.12,1248.8
     But it comes true with practice.
},
{
    1248.8,1251.24
     Just be patient and practice around.
},
{
    1251.24,1257.32
     And it's not about just only just get your belly out, you actually can use your intercostal
},
{
    1257.32,1259.96
     muscle which is between your rib cage.
},
{
    1259.96,1266.56
     They can open up your rib cage out and basically help you to get more air to your
},
{
    1266.56,1273.32
     and Darfrog. Practice this routine and slowly build up your range of movements.
},
{
    1273.32,1278.44
