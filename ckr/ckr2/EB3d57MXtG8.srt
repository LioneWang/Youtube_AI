     Hello, my name is Anne Green and Nauman.
},
{
    10.84,15.56
     I'm a physical therapist from the Orthopedic Rehab Center on Tilly Drive.
},
{
    15.56,19.16
     I'm here today to talk to you about how to use a TENS unit.
},
{
    19.16,24.12
     TENS stands for Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation, which basically means using
},
{
    24.12,28.84
     electricity to trick the brain into not feeling as much pain.
},
{
    28.84,31.52
     We use TENS for all kinds of pain.
},
{
    31.52,37.0
     TENS is used for postoperative pain and can help decrease the use of opioid medications.
},
{
    37.0,40.32
     TENS is also used for chronic pain.
},
{
    40.32,46.64
     TENS is even used by women in labor when they're having babies.
},
{
    52.64,57.28
     TENS is a very safe modality and it's been around for a long time, but there are some precautions. So we don't use TENS directly over the heart.
},
{
    57.28,61.52
     We don't use TENS over the carotid arteries.
},
{
    61.52,64.48
     We don't use TENS with the brain in the middle.
},
{
    66.54,70.64
     carotid arteries. We don't use tins with the brain in the middle. We don't use tins if there are any implanted electrical devices or if you have a
},
{
    70.64,76.1
     cardiac arrhythmia, particularly in the area of the pregnancy, except during
},
{
    76.1,82.0
     labor. Tins doesn't mix well with water so you don't wear tins in the shower.
},
{
    82.0,85.04
     It's really easy when the tins is hooked on your pants
},
{
    85.04,88.48
     to drop it in the toilet, so you want to be careful not to do that.
},
{
    88.48,97.0
     The last thing is that we don't want to use tins for pain that we don't know the cause of. If
},
{
    97.0,102.56
     there's pain, we don't want to be using tins to mask it if we don't know what the cause is because
},
{
    102.56,107.0
     the pain is telling you something and it needs to be evaluated.
},
{
    107.0,130.92
     So when you get your TENS unit, it will come some electrode wires like this. So the
},
{
    130.92,135.2
     first thing that you'll need to do is to put the batteries in. So if you turn
},
{
    135.2,140.34
     over the tens to the back and slide this out you'll see there's a battery area
},
{
    140.34,147.12
     to put the batteries in. Mine are already in there. So then you're going to close it back up.
},
{
    147.12,151.64
     And then what you're going to need to do is put the electrode wires in.
},
{
    151.64,156.48
     So the wires are, in order to bring the electricity from the little unit
},
{
    156.48,157.64
     into you.
},
{
    157.64,160.28
     When you look at the wires, you will see
},
{
    160.28,163.52
     that there is a straight end and a bent end.
},
{
    163.52,167.5
     The bent end goes in the machine. You'll see at the top of the machine
},
{
    167.5,170.84
     there are two little holes. You put the
},
{
    170.84,174.64
     bent end in, push it all the way in,
},
{
    174.64,177.94
     and then you're going to take
},
{
    177.94,181.46
     the electrodes. So if you are having
},
{
    181.46,184.98
     post op, you're using the TENS for postoperative pain,
},
{
    184.98,185.88
     your electrodes will be placed by your surgeon op, you're using the TENS for post operative pain, your electrodes
},
{
    185.88,188.36
     will be placed by your surgeon.
},
{
    188.36,194.84
     If you're using TENS more for other types of pain, then you might be applying them yourself.
},
{
    194.84,201.46
     I'm going to show you how to set it up with the electrodes as if you were doing it yourself.
},
{
    201.46,210.0
     So the electrodes come in a little bag. There are four electrodes in the bag.
},
{
    210.0,215.0
     And what you're going to do is take the straight end of the electrode wire and
},
{
    215.0,227.0
     push it into the little hole here on the electrode. So you want to push it all the way in so that there's no metal showing.
},
{
    228.84,230.0
     Now,
},
{
    230.0,234.4
     there are four electrodes. You can use either two or four electrodes when you're
},
{
    234.4,236.46
     using the tens on yourself.
},
{
    236.46,239.84
     If you have a small area of pain, you would use two.
},
{
    239.84,242.08
     If you have a larger area of pain,
},
{
    242.08,244.18
     you would use four.
},
{
    244.18,247.0
     I'm going to show you first how to do it on
},
{
    247.06,254.06
     my arm and then we'll talk about how you might place it on your low back.
},
{
    256.24,261.32
     So now what we need to do is apply the electrodes. So we're going to pretend that I have an elbow
},
{
    261.32,269.6
     problem. So I'm going to show you how I would put the electrodes on my elbow. So when you use the electrodes you want to try not to
},
{
    269.6,273.44
     touch them anymore than you have to because they're sticky and the more
},
{
    273.44,277.64
     you touch them the more sticky stuff you lose. So I'm going to peel it off trying
},
{
    277.64,283.12
     just to touch the very edge of it and I'm going to put the area of pain in
},
{
    283.12,287.4
     between the two electrodes. So we're pretending that my elbow is hurting here,
},
{
    287.4,289.4
     I'm going to put one below the elbow,
},
{
    289.4,292.4
     and then I'm going to peel the other one off,
},
{
    294.4,297.4
     and I'm going to put the other one above.
},
{
    297.4,300.4
     So now I have one below and one above.
},
{
    301.4,304.6
     If you were going to use the Tendzuta on a bigger area,
},
{
    304.6,306.2
     you would need to use four electrodes.
},
{
    306.2,311.44
     So we already have one set of wires plugged in with the control right next to it.
},
{
    311.44,313.72
     Now we're going to plug the next set in.
},
{
    313.72,317.82
     Same thing, the bent end goes into the machine.
},
{
    317.82,320.5
     And then the straight end goes to the electrodes.
},
{
    320.5,324.14
     And in order to place the electrodes, what I would do is put the area of pain in the
},
{
    324.14,325.0
     middle of the electrode.
},
{
    325.0,333.0
     So I might put one electrode here above the area of pain and then hooked into the same electrode,
},
{
    333.0,338.0
     that same wire, put the other one lower and to the opposite side.
},
{
    338.0,344.0
     And then the next set, you would do the same thing so that what you get is kind of the area of pain in the middle.
},
{
    344.0,346.44
     And we have kind of a crisscross pattern.
},
{
    348.2,354.12
     If you had more leg pain, then what you could do is use two electrodes on the back,
},
{
    354.12,358.64
     and then use two electrodes down on the leg.
},
{
    360.12,363.12
     So if you had upper back or neck pain, you could do the same thing.
},
{
    363.12,366.48
     So you'd put your electrodes criss-crossed, criss-crossed
},
{
    366.48,367.96
     with the same ideas in the low back.
},
{
    370.76,372.44
     Now in order to turn it on, we're going
},
{
    372.44,374.52
     to open the front door of the unit.
},
{
    374.52,377.44
     So there's a little door right here.
},
{
    377.44,380.68
     You're going to flip it down, and you'll see the controls.
},
{
    380.68,382.88
     The first control that we're going to talk about
},
{
    382.88,384.24
     is the on-off button.
},
{
    384.24,385.68
     That's this button right here.
},
{
    385.68,390.52
     So if you push that button, the unit should come on.
},
{
    390.52,394.84
     And there you can see that the screen has got some things on it.
},
{
    394.84,398.24
     The next thing we need to do is decide the mode.
},
{
    398.24,401.32
     Or there's lots of different ways you can set the 10s unit.
},
{
    401.32,406.34
     So we're going to pick one of the pre-program modes and that comes to
},
{
    406.34,413.62
     right here. There's a mode button right there. It's the top row, the second one from the
},
{
    413.62,417.72
     right. So if you push the mode button, some choices will come up and you can see them
},
{
    417.72,423.46
     on the screen. So right now it's on constant mode. That's not one I recommend. It's just
},
{
    423.46,425.48
     continuous 10s and people get used to it
},
{
    425.48,430.28
     really fast and you have to keep turning it up. So that's not one I recommend. You
},
{
    430.28,435.0
     can do what's called burst mode. That's another choice. That's a good
},
{
    435.0,439.8
     mode to choose. There's two burst modes. So the second burst mode, they each feel
},
{
    439.8,444.2
     a little different. Or you can use one of the modulation modes. So there's
},
{
    444.2,445.12
     modulation one and modulation two. So either one of the modulation modes. So there's modulation 1
},
{
    445.12,449.68
     and modulation 2. So either one of the burst modes or one of the modulation
},
{
    449.68,453.48
     modes are what I recommend. So I'm going to go ahead with this modulation mode
},
{
    453.48,459.28
     right here. So now I've got, I've chosen, I've got it on, I've chosen my mode and
},
{
    459.28,464.48
     the last thing you can think about is the timing. So there's a little timer here.
},
{
    464.48,466.8
     It looks like a clock face that's right below the mode button and you can think about is the timing. So there's a little timer here. It looks like a clock face
},
{
    466.8,471.92
     that's right below the mode button and you can push it and you can choose 60 minutes, 30 minutes
},
{
    473.2,479.6
     or continuous mode. So I'm going to choose the, well that was a 15. Okay so I'm going to choose
},
{
    479.6,488.88
     a 30 minute. So you could choose 60, 30 or 15. Okay And that will just, it will go for that amount of time and then automatically shut off.
},
{
    488.88,490.84
     And now I'm going to close that window.
},
{
    490.84,492.68
     And now we're going to turn the unit on.
},
{
    492.68,497.16
     And we turn the unit on at the top of it with these two dials.
},
{
    497.16,501.84
     So the dial on the right takes care of these electrodes that are hooked into that right
},
{
    501.84,502.84
     side.
},
{
    502.84,506.02
     The dial on the left we're not using right now.
},
{
    506.02,511.9
     So I'm going to go ahead and turn the unit on and I'm going to feel a little bit of buzzing
},
{
    511.9,515.18
     or tingling and I can definitely feel that right now.
},
{
    515.18,519.34
     So I feel a tingling and buzzing here and here and I can kind of feel it going right
},
{
    519.34,522.16
     along my elbow.
},
{
    522.16,527.0
     Some people describe it as like a feeling like something crawling, some people say it's tingling.
},
{
    527.0,533.0
     What we want to do is turn it up so that you can definitely feel the tingling fairly strong,
},
{
    533.0,539.0
     but not so high that it bugs you. You'll get better pain control, the stronger you can tolerate it on,
},
{
    539.0,545.24
     but we don't want it to be causing more discomfort. So you go ahead and turn it up as high as you need to
},
{
    545.24,547.4
     to feel it nice and strong.
},
{
    547.4,549.92
     So I'm going to go a little bit stronger here.
},
{
    551.32,552.68
     Oops, I went the wrong way.
},
{
    552.68,554.3
     So that's coming nice and strong.
},
{
    554.3,555.6
     Oh yeah, there we go.
},
{
    556.82,558.4
     So it's really tingling,
},
{
    558.4,560.8
     but I'm not getting any muscle twitching.
},
{
    560.8,562.68
     So I don't really want the muscle twitching,
},
{
    562.68,564.38
     but that's really, really tingling.
},
{
    567.0,574.76
     So I don't really want the muscle twitching, but that's really, really tingling. When you're ready to turn it off, you're going to go ahead and turn down the dial so that
},
{
    574.76,577.26
     you no longer feel the electricity.
},
{
    577.26,580.4
     So I know you're feeling it there.
},
{
    580.4,585.4
     If you have set the timer, it will automatically turn off the electricity after that time.
},
{
    585.4,589.9
     But then you want to go ahead and turn the unit off because otherwise you'll use up the batteries.
},
{
    589.9,592.5
     So then you would go ahead and turn the unit off.
},
{
    592.5,596.3
     When you do that, you're going to have to hold the on-off button down,
},
{
    596.3,599.1
     and then you'll see the screen go black.
},
{
    599.1,603.1
     Then what you're going to want to do is peel the electrodes off.
},
{
    603.1,605.12
     Again, you want to try not to
},
{
    605.12,611.04
     handle them any more than you have to. And then you're going to put them on your paper again.
},
{
    613.28,621.2
     Again, I'm trying not to handle it. And then they get zipped back into their ziplock bag.
},
{
    621.84,625.68
     The electrodes will be good for about a week's use
},
{
    625.68,627.54
     and then they'll get unsticky.
},
{
    627.54,630.32
     And you can get a few more days use out of them
},
{
    630.32,632.28
     if you take them off their paper,
},
{
    632.28,634.48
     put them sticky side up and put a little bit of water
},
{
    634.48,637.4
     on your fingers and get them wet and wait 60 seconds.
},
{
    639.32,642.36
     As you use it, you will get used to the sensation
},
{
    642.36,644.84
     of the electricity and you may need to turn it up
},
{
    644.84,648.0
     over time in order to keep that strong feeling of the electricity.
},
{
    648.0,654.64
     You can also use the TENS unit with your cryo cuff or with an ice pack. It's fine
},
{
    654.64,659.36
     to put them together with that and that can help to manage your pain using two
},
{
    659.36,664.24
     different things the ice and the TENS and that may be helpful. We don't want to use
},
{
    664.24,668.04
     the TENS continually for 24 hours because you get used to the
},
{
    668.04,669.44
     sensation of electricity.
},
{
    669.44,675.3
     So you're going to use the tins for 30 to 60 minutes at a time, and then you'll go ahead
},
{
    675.3,680.56
     and turn it off for a while, and then when you feel like your pain is bothering you again,
},
{
    680.56,689.88
     you can turn it back on. So you can leave the electrodes on and then turn the device on or off as you need to.
},
{
    689.88,695.2
     We worry a little bit about making sure people's skin doesn't get irritated by
},
{
    695.2,702.08
     the tins. So if you're using tins for chronic pain management, you want to be
},
{
    702.08,705.24
     sure every day to take the electrodes off, wash
},
{
    705.24,710.72
     the skin, let it air dry, and make sure that it's not irritated in any way. If
},
{
    710.72,715.8
     your skin it becomes irritated you don't want to place the TENS electrodes over
},
{
    715.8,722.04
     the skin. If you're using the TENS for postoperative pain, we actually don't
},
{
    722.04,729.24
     want you to do that. We want you to leave the TENS electrodes in place until after your first post-op visit with your surgeon.
},
{
    729.24,737.16
     After that, then you would do the same skin care regimen. If you have further
},
{
    737.16,742.28
     questions, then you can ask them from the person at OrthoCare who gives you the
},
{
    742.28,745.52
     unit. You can also call physical therapy
},
{
    745.52,747.58
     at the Orthopedic Rehab Center on Tilly Drive.
},
{
    747.58,750.88
     Our number is 847-7910.
},
{
    750.88,754.72
     So if you need more help than what you learned here today
},
{
    754.72,756.88
     or from the handout that we're gonna be giving you,
},
{
    756.88,758.28
     feel free to give us a call.
},
