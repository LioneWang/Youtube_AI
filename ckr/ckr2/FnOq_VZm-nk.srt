     What's up guys? Hey, Jared Beckstrand here, doctor of physical therapy, ConanTitan.com
},
{
    4.0,9.28
     and in this video I wanted to show you the stretching routine that I used to eliminate my shoulder pain.
},
{
    9.28,10.8
     Let's do it right now.
},
{
    17.6,20.72
     All right, full disclosure, yes I am a physical therapist
},
{
    21.6,26.32
     and yes I have had shoulder pain for almost a year now and
},
{
    26.32,30.56
     it sucks and it's horrible and I know exactly what it is and I know exactly
},
{
    30.56,35.16
     what I should be doing about it but do I do it? No again I'm a physical therapist
},
{
    35.16,39.72
     I tell other people to do it I don't do it myself. Honestly you guys so what
},
{
    39.72,44.2
     brought it on it was overtraining it was lifting too heavy without significant
},
{
    44.2,45.0
     or without enough
},
{
    45.0,51.0
     rest between days. It wasn't until I started to perform these exercises regularly that
},
{
    51.0,55.16
     that shoulder started to feel better. I would do some rotator cuff strengthening stuff,
},
{
    55.16,60.4
     but honestly, as soon as I jumped into this regular stretching routine, it made all the
},
{
    60.4,64.2
     difference in the world for me. So that's my goal in shooting this video today. I want
},
{
    64.2,67.92
     to be able to help you guys out of some of the shoulder pain and shoulder discomfort
},
{
    67.92,72.4
     that you might be experiencing. Now, quick caveat before we jump right into these,
},
{
    72.4,77.84
     not all shoulder pain is created equally. It's not all caused by the same thing. These stretches
},
{
    77.84,84.0
     work great for overuse type injuries. However, if there's anything more severe than that,
},
{
    84.0,88.56
     if there's anything more significant going on, you should go get that checked out before jumping into
},
{
    88.56,93.28
     this or any exercise or workout routine. Let's jump into this, you guys. I've got
},
{
    93.28,97.12
     six stretches that I'm going to share with you right now. I'm going to run
},
{
    97.12,100.92
     through them with you real time. We're gonna hold each one for 15 seconds.
},
{
    100.92,105.56
     There's a five-second break between each. And then we're gonna do three sets
},
{
    105.56,108.32
     of each one of those stretches, each one of those exercises.
},
{
    108.32,110.12
     So again, I've got you right here.
},
{
    110.12,111.52
     We're in my living room.
},
{
    111.52,114.36
     This is where I would do these exercises.
},
{
    114.36,116.76
     This is how I would do these exercises.
},
{
    116.76,118.24
     So that being said, I'm gonna go ahead
},
{
    118.24,120.72
     and we're gonna get down into the first exercise.
},
{
    120.72,123.92
     First one is an inferior capsule stretch.
},
{
    123.92,127.68
     Basically an overhead stretch that you can do on the ground.
},
{
    127.68,129.76
     I found this to be a little more tolerable.
},
{
    129.76,131.16
     Hit start on this.
},
{
    131.16,134.0
     What you're gonna do is get into this tall kneel position,
},
{
    134.0,136.66
     bring the bad hand over with your palm up.
},
{
    136.66,138.88
     The other hand secures you at the wrist
},
{
    138.88,141.88
     and then I'm going to sit down and back
},
{
    141.88,144.16
     into this position right here.
},
{
    144.16,147.04
     My goal, I'm gonna hold this for 15 seconds.
},
{
    147.04,150.4
     So it's just like this, a nice comfortable stretch.
},
{
    150.4,152.64
     Okay, there it is, there's your first 15 seconds.
},
{
    152.64,154.2
     The goal is I want you to feel that
},
{
    154.2,155.68
     in this spot right here.
},
{
    155.68,157.88
     Here's our second 15 seconds.
},
{
    157.88,160.6
     So we're gonna get down into this stretch
},
{
    160.6,162.88
     and hold for 15 seconds.
},
{
    162.88,167.6
     I'm sitting down and back and pulling my right arm
},
{
    167.6,168.52
     kind of up and away.
},
{
    168.52,171.64
     My left hand anchors my right wrist.
},
{
    171.64,174.54
     There's your second 15 seconds, five second break.
},
{
    175.5,176.58
     And one more time.
},
{
    176.58,180.08
     This is a great, we call this an inferior capsule stretch.
},
{
    180.08,181.92
     It gets tight on everybody.
},
{
    181.92,184.64
     This is a great way to stretch that out.
},
{
    184.64,187.52
     So this is my third 15 second hold
},
{
    188.64,195.2
     and then we're going to jump into an internal rotation stretch. So this sleeper stretch is number
},
{
    195.2,200.96
     two. Get into this position and now I'm just going to apply some gentle pressure to the back of my
},
{
    200.96,207.52
     wrist pushing my hand down in this position right here. Honestly, this is the one that made the world of difference
},
{
    207.52,210.76
     in treating my shoulder pain and discomfort.
},
{
    210.76,212.4
     So there's our first 15 seconds.
},
{
    212.4,214.16
     Keep your shoulder blade tucked down.
},
{
    214.16,215.96
     So tuck your shoulder blade down.
},
{
    215.96,220.3
     Your elbow comes out, your elbow stays at a 90 degree angle
},
{
    220.3,223.0
     as you're getting into that position right there.
},
{
    223.0,225.28
     Just a gentle pressure with my left
},
{
    225.28,230.88
     hand on the back of my right wrist until a comfortable stretch is felt.
},
{
    230.88,237.16
     There's my second 15 seconds, five second break, and then third 15 seconds.
},
{
    237.16,241.84
     I feel that one a lot in the back of my shoulder, a little bit in the top of my shoulder.
},
{
    241.84,243.8
     Those are the areas that we're going for.
},
{
    243.8,246.2
     This is my last 15 seconds
},
{
    246.2,253.04
     on this internal rotation stretch. This is stretching all the external rotators in your
},
{
    253.04,258.28
     shoulder. Okay, next we're going to come over here. We're going to do two stretches in the
},
{
    258.28,266.82
     doorway. First one is a low doorway stretch. Get into this position right here. My hands are anchored in the door back behind me.
},
{
    266.82,270.42
     Chest is high and I'm leaning onto my front foot
},
{
    270.42,272.06
     right there in that position.
},
{
    272.06,273.08
     That's the first one.
},
{
    273.08,274.9
     Let's do two more of those.
},
{
    276.52,279.78
     The goal here, and I especially felt this one,
},
{
    279.78,281.9
     you get this one a lot in your biceps tendon.
},
{
    281.9,289.66
     You get this one a lot in your superior shoulder, kind of right where that rotator cuff attaches. If you've got a lot
},
{
    289.66,295.26
     of pain that you experienced, there's our second 15 seconds one more time. Looks
},
{
    295.26,298.9
     just like this. If you've got a lot of pain, again I was getting a lot of pain
},
{
    298.9,304.06
     from just bench pressing. Too heavy, too much, too regularly. I was working really
},
{
    304.06,305.28
     hard at increasing weight
},
{
    305.28,306.32
     on the bench press.
},
{
    306.32,308.8
     That's what led to a lot of the anterior shoulder pain
},
{
    308.8,310.2
     that I was experiencing.
},
{
    310.2,311.84
     This is a great stretch for that.
},
{
    311.84,314.88
     It gets that chest, kind of the pec tendon as well.
},
{
    314.88,317.72
     Next, let's move into a doorway stretch.
},
{
    317.72,319.72
     That's more for the rotator cuff.
},
{
    319.72,323.76
     So a high doorway stretch with some external rotation
},
{
    323.76,325.6
     is what we're gonna to call this one.
},
{
    330.16,336.0
     Position is very close to the same. We're going to hold for three, two, one more second, just like that. My forearms are on the door frame, the whole forearms. My elbows are just
},
{
    336.0,341.68
     a little bit lower than shoulder height. And then I'm just trying to lean my head forward,
},
{
    341.68,346.64
     lean my whole torso and my whole body forward to stretch out that shoulder.
},
{
    346.64,351.52
     I feel that all through my chest, especially through my pec tendons, but then I'm also
},
{
    351.52,357.36
     getting into this externally rotated position to stretch my tight internal rotators.
},
{
    357.36,360.44
     So this is my last one right here.
},
{
    360.44,361.44
     Looks just like that.
},
{
    361.44,363.6
     We're coming hard and fast, you guys.
},
{
    363.6,366.4
     I don't ever explain my way through these
},
{
    366.4,371.24
     So I hope that we're hitting on the points that we need to hit on I hope that these help you to feel better
},
{
    371.4,374.48
     There's my third 15 seconds right there next
},
{
    374.48,380.64
     We're gonna do a posterior shoulder stretch my right arm goes right across my body left hand grabs my right elbow
},
{
    380.64,391.4
     And I'm pulling in that direction right there. I'm going to hold that one comfortably for 15 seconds. Three, two, and one and then relax. You
},
{
    391.4,394.76
     should feel that one right along the back of the shoulder. This is for that
},
{
    394.76,399.16
     posterior capsule and part of your shoulder that gets tight in a lot of
},
{
    399.16,404.32
     people. It's that posterior and inferior capsule that get tight on a lot of people.
},
{
    404.32,409.6
     This is my second 15 seconds and really affects the mechanics in the shoulder.
},
{
    409.64,413.44
     As I'm holding this, there's two, and then we've got one more.
},
{
    414.16,416.12
     And so when we run through these,
},
{
    416.16,418.84
     so we stretched the bottom part of the shoulder,
},
{
    419.08,421.48
     we stretched the inside and the outside.
},
{
    421.48,423.68
     This is kind of the back part of the shoulder.
},
{
    423.96,426.28
     The last one that I'm gonna run you guys through
},
{
    426.28,430.56
     is going to be for the top of the shoulder, three, two, one.
},
{
    430.56,433.2
     And now to do that, I've got this big heavy table.
},
{
    433.2,436.46
     What I'm going to do is hook my hand right underneath it
},
{
    436.46,438.6
     and then just try to stand up.
},
{
    438.6,440.8
     So I'm trying to actually kind of stand up,
},
{
    440.8,443.32
     lean away from the table slightly.
},
{
    443.32,446.32
     I want to feel a stretch basically from the base of my
},
{
    446.32,452.0
     skull through the top of my shoulder all the way down to about right there is where I get that one.
},
{
    452.0,456.56
     There's your first 15 seconds. And then honestly with this one I'll even kind of move around a
},
{
    456.56,461.36
     little bit with it. So we'll kind of get into this position, take a step forward kind of into that
},
{
    461.36,465.68
     position. As you change the angle of that pull, you can kind
},
{
    465.68,472.56
     of change where you feel that in your shoulder. Looks just like that. There's my second 15
},
{
    472.56,478.56
     seconds. A lot of what I had going on was impingement or supraspinatus tendonitis. And
},
{
    478.56,489.88
     this really helped to target that supraspinatus. That's your rotator cuff muscle that comes over the top of your shoulder and down. Really helped me to really help me to target
},
{
    489.88,495.12
     that area as I stretched and as I pulled through there. I think that's three.
},
{
    495.12,498.92
     Okay guys, I'm getting the nod from my wife. That was three. Hey you guys, so there you
},
{
    498.92,504.48
     have it. Super simple. Six stretches that hopefully help to improve your
},
{
    504.48,505.76
     shoulder mobility and
},
{
    505.76,509.28
     decrease some of the pain or discomfort that you might be experiencing.
},
{
    509.28,513.36
     These were things that absolutely helped me to help my shoulder to feel better.
},
{
    513.36,515.84
     I hope that you find the same experience with them.
