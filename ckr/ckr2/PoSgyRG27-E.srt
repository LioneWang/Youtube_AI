     In this video, I'm going to show you how to get rid of calf muscle pain for good.
},
{
    4.02,5.02
     Stay tuned.
},
{
    5.02,6.02
     Hey, everyone.
},
{
    6.02,13.64
     Dr. O'Rell coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan.
},
{
    13.64,17.48
     In this video, we're going to deal with tight, achy, dull, painful calves.
},
{
    17.48,20.66
     I'm going to break it down into a very easy three-part guide.
},
{
    20.66,24.52
     In the first part, we're going to focus on a wonderful self-massage technique.
},
{
    24.52,29.04
     It might end up becoming your new favorite therapy. In the second part we're going to get everything loosened up
},
{
    29.04,34.32
     and moving with great stretching exercises for the calves. In the third part we're going to focus on
},
{
    34.32,40.8
     strengthening those calves with very easy to do exercises that may help lead to less instances
},
{
    40.8,46.2
     of calf pain in the future. All these exercises can be done at home, don't require any special equipment,
},
{
    46.2,49.9
     and may give quick relief, even in as little as 30 seconds.
},
{
    49.9,53.16
     So let's get started and get rid of that calf pain right now.
},
{
    53.16,55.0
     In the first part, let's try to focus on getting
},
{
    55.0,57.02
     instant pain relief into our calf muscles
},
{
    57.02,59.98
     with what is called Gua Sha, or muscle scraping.
},
{
    59.98,62.92
     It's a wonderful technique at getting rid of muscle tightness,
},
{
    62.92,65.36
     muscle spasms, cramps,
},
{
    65.36,69.36
     trigger points, you name it, very easily and very effectively.
},
{
    69.36,70.44
     We need two things.
},
{
    70.44,72.44
     The first being a large metal spoon.
},
{
    72.44,74.56
     I like one with a little bit more thickness.
},
{
    74.56,75.88
     You'll get better results.
},
{
    75.88,77.64
     The next is a form of lubrication.
},
{
    77.64,80.84
     You can use any massage lotions or massage creams.
},
{
    80.84,85.12
     You can even use pain relief creams such as bio freeze or icy hot.
},
{
    85.12,88.84
     Just cope pretty much from the knee all the way down to the ankle, front and back.
},
{
    88.84,92.92
     When it comes to lubrication, a little bit more is always better.
},
{
    92.92,95.28
     After we've done that, what I'm going to do is take my spoon.
},
{
    95.28,98.24
     It doesn't really matter what part of the spoon you take.
},
{
    98.24,102.04
     I find that using the handle is a little bit easier, but you can use the rounded portion
},
{
    102.04,103.04
     here.
},
{
    103.04,104.04
     Actually experiment with it.
},
{
    104.04,105.12
     Take what is most effective.
},
{
    105.12,106.36
     But what I'm going to do is start
},
{
    106.36,109.16
     at the bottom of the leg, right at the ankle.
},
{
    109.16,110.0
     And when you do this,
},
{
    110.0,112.2
     make sure to only go over soft tissue,
},
{
    112.2,114.62
     muscle that you can grab onto, skin,
},
{
    114.62,117.04
     stay off any bony spots like this
},
{
    117.04,118.72
     because that can cause irritation
},
{
    118.72,120.28
     and we definitely don't want that.
},
{
    120.28,121.92
     So I'm going to take my spoon,
},
{
    121.92,123.12
     and I'm going to use the handle right here
},
{
    123.12,125.64
     and put it at about a 30 degree angle. And I'm going to press into spoon and I'm going to use the handle right here and put it at about a 30 degree angle.
},
{
    125.64,128.96
     And I'm going to press into the point where there's enough pressure that once I start
},
{
    128.96,132.68
     to scrape upwards like this, it will feel like a nice self-massage.
},
{
    132.68,134.88
     We don't want this to cause discomfort.
},
{
    134.88,138.86
     So if it does back off a little bit, only go to your comfort level.
},
{
    138.86,140.24
     But just work your way up.
},
{
    140.24,143.3
     When you do this, you want to go bottom to the top.
},
{
    143.3,148.0
     And you want to do about five to ten slow repetitions in each spot.
},
{
    148.0,151.0
     And then once you're done with that, just switch over to a different spot and repeat.
},
{
    151.0,155.0
     You want to go front to back and pretty much just target those spots.
},
{
    155.0,160.0
     When you do this also, you might find that one certain spot just feels very gritty,
},
{
    160.0,161.0
     almost like sandpaper.
},
{
    161.0,164.0
     That's a spot of adhesion and you want to make note of that.
},
{
    164.0,165.44
     That's usually a spot that's causing tightness and possibly adhesion and you want to make note of that. That's usually a spot
},
{
    165.44,170.4
     that's causing tightness and possibly pain and you want to break that up. When you do this also,
},
{
    170.4,174.88
     you might notice that pockets of redness form on the top of the skin. That is completely normal.
},
{
    174.88,179.92
     That's blood flow coming into the area, which is good. It's improving circulation and bringing in
},
{
    179.92,184.4
     blood to hopefully promote healing. But once you're done with that, really try to focus on the front
},
{
    184.4,185.6
     here on the shin. Chin pain is very common, so really attack that. But once you're done with that, really try to focus on the front here on the shin.
},
{
    185.6,188.06
     Shin pain is very common, so really attack that.
},
{
    188.06,192.7
     But work your way up into the calf, all the way up to the knee, front and back.
},
{
    192.7,195.22
     When you're done with that, you can definitely use different parts of the spoon.
},
{
    195.22,197.46
     You know, dig in there and experiment with it.
},
{
    197.46,199.9
     You can also attack it at different angles.
},
{
    199.9,205.1
     So instead of going up with it, go at 45 degrees forward, and then go 45 degrees backwards.
},
{
    205.1,208.14
     Take whatever you feel is working the best.
},
{
    208.14,211.38
     And any spots that feel like they're locked up tight,
},
{
    211.38,213.46
     throw more repetitions in there to break up
},
{
    213.46,215.26
     that muscle tightness, that spasm,
},
{
    215.26,216.7
     whatever you might have.
},
{
    216.7,219.42
     Once we're done with that, let's throw some motion
},
{
    219.42,221.38
     into that calf muscle to challenge it
},
{
    221.38,225.2
     to open up new spots that might be causing pain or discomfort.
},
{
    225.2,228.44
     So what I'd like to do is press for my heel into the floor
},
{
    228.44,230.68
     and then I'm going to just take my toes
},
{
    230.68,232.08
     upwards towards the ceiling.
},
{
    232.08,234.12
     What this will do is activate that calf muscle.
},
{
    234.12,236.08
     So again, start to go over that
},
{
    236.08,239.48
     and you may find that new spots of tightness have formed
},
{
    239.48,242.52
     or new spots of pain can be targeted.
},
{
    242.52,246.48
     So really dig in there and try to loosen that up.
},
{
    246.48,249.82
     I also like to do a little bit more ankle motion.
},
{
    249.82,252.66
     So what I'm going to do is turn my ankle inward,
},
{
    252.66,254.78
     repeat that, and then once I'm done with that,
},
{
    254.78,256.5
     I'm going to turn my ankle outwards
},
{
    256.5,258.5
     and then repeat that also, because this just
},
{
    258.5,261.66
     activates that calf muscle just a little bit differently.
},
{
    261.66,263.22
     But go through all of those motions,
},
{
    263.22,266.24
     go through all of the areas, target spots of ahesion,
},
{
    266.24,269.04
     or any spots that you feel are tight and achy.
},
{
    269.04,270.1
     Try to loosen that up,
},
{
    270.1,271.44
     and I hope that that gives you
},
{
    271.44,273.64
     a lot of quick calf pain relief.
},
{
    273.64,274.48
     In the second part,
},
{
    274.48,277.44
     let's focus on getting rid of calf muscle pain
},
{
    277.44,280.2
     with some wonderful stretching exercises.
},
{
    280.2,282.6
     Let's just get everything loosened up.
},
{
    282.6,285.8
     This first exercise is called a calf rock back.
},
{
    285.8,287.48
     It's very easy to do.
},
{
    287.48,291.3
     We're going to start off on all fours on the floor just like this.
},
{
    291.3,294.52
     From there, what I'm going to do is go into kind of like a push-up position.
},
{
    294.52,296.28
     I'm going to put my feet out like this.
},
{
    296.28,299.52
     My weight is going to be placed on my toes.
},
{
    299.52,302.62
     Whatever side that we're focusing on, let's say that I have a little bit more off to my
},
{
    302.62,307.56
     right, I'm going to lift my left leg up, keep my right leg straight, and then just place my foot over
},
{
    307.56,312.2
     the calf muscle on the right side just like this. What I want to do from there
},
{
    312.2,316.72
     is a rocking motion. So I'm going to rock forward. That is with my whole body is
},
{
    316.72,322.04
     one complete movement rocking forward by driving through my toes. When you do this
},
{
    322.04,329.12
     you're going to feel the muscles into that calf really start to fire. Really focus on that as much as you can. You want to feel
},
{
    329.12,333.64
     it into the calves. But hold this position for about three to five seconds.
},
{
    333.64,338.28
     From there you're going to try to then take the heel towards the floor. Press
},
{
    338.28,343.04
     with your hands right here too to lower your heel down even further and it is a
},
{
    343.04,347.9
     deep stretch into that calf muscle. Again, hold three to five seconds
},
{
    347.9,351.34
     only to your comfort level. From there, just do this
},
{
    351.34,355.38
     for about 15 complete repetitions. With each repetition,
},
{
    355.38,359.08
     always challenge yourself to go forward and then backwards
},
{
    359.08,363.1
     even more. It will help engage those muscles even more to hopefully give you
},
{
    363.1,366.36
     more pain relief. And when you're done on one side,
},
{
    366.36,370.32
     always switch to the other to keep them both in balance.
},
{
    370.32,373.4
     So here is a great calf stretching exercise
},
{
    373.4,376.5
     that you can pretty much do anywhere, even at work.
},
{
    376.5,379.16
     You just need to go next to a door or a wall.
},
{
    379.16,381.04
     I recommend doing it next to a door
},
{
    381.04,383.88
     because you'll see why here in just a minute.
},
{
    383.88,384.92
     What I'm gonna do is start off
},
{
    384.92,388.8
     in a scissor stance like this. Whatever side that we're focusing on, in this case I'm having right
},
{
    388.8,393.84
     calf pain, I want to place that one forward and then I'm going to place my toes on the door
},
{
    393.84,399.44
     and then lower my heel down into the floor for a stable anchor point. When you do this too,
},
{
    399.44,404.4
     you also want to bring the toes back towards you or raise them up on the door as much as possible.
},
{
    404.4,407.32
     Build an initial stretch into that calf muscle.
},
{
    407.32,409.16
     You want an initial stretch to begin with.
},
{
    409.16,411.06
     You'll get better results with this.
},
{
    411.06,415.2
     You can then take the hand, whatever side you want, grab onto the doorknob if you need
},
{
    415.2,417.5
     to for extra stability.
},
{
    417.5,421.18
     But what I want to do is keep this knee straight, the side that we're focusing on, the other
},
{
    421.18,422.56
     one can go bent.
},
{
    422.56,427.84
     I'm going to use this back leg right here to push forward with my body weight.
},
{
    427.84,429.76
     So I'm kind of lifting off like this
},
{
    429.76,432.76
     and pressing my body towards that door of the wall.
},
{
    432.76,434.84
     The more that you do this, go forward,
},
{
    434.84,437.24
     the more intense the stretch is going to be felt
},
{
    437.24,440.0
     into the calf, so only go to your comfort level.
},
{
    440.0,442.56
     Hold this comfortably for 20 seconds.
},
{
    442.56,444.88
     From there, relax, take a breather,
},
{
    444.88,447.48
     and then repeat this up to five times.
},
{
    447.48,450.18
     With each repetition, try to drive your body weight
},
{
    450.18,453.12
     forward even more because it will only help stretch
},
{
    453.12,456.12
     those calves out and hopefully lead to more pain
},
{
    456.12,457.56
     and tightness relief.
},
{
    457.56,459.66
     If you want to take this one to the next level,
},
{
    459.66,462.06
     what you can do is stretch into it,
},
{
    462.06,465.12
     but then pull forward even more with the doorknob.
},
{
    465.12,469.76
     I'm using my hand right here at the doorknob to pull myself forward even more.
},
{
    469.76,472.8
     This can become extremely intense of a stretch.
},
{
    472.8,475.08
     Again, only to your comfort level.
},
{
    475.08,480.32
     If you want to take this one even to the next level, move over to the door frame right here.
},
{
    480.32,485.12
     Open the door, grab the backside of that door frame, and pull yourself forward even more.
},
{
    485.12,489.76
     But again, only to your comfort level. Go through those, take what is most effective,
},
{
    489.76,495.04
     and remember, always switch to the other side to keep them both in balance.
},
{
    495.04,500.96
     So without a doubt, if we want to get rid of calf pain for good, we have to strengthen all of those
},
{
    500.96,505.64
     muscles to hopefully future-proof them from pain and tightness.
},
{
    505.64,508.68
     This one is best done next to a staircase,
},
{
    508.68,511.28
     but you can also use something like a yoga block,
},
{
    511.28,512.58
     and I'll get grief for this,
},
{
    512.58,514.96
     but you can use a stack of hardcover books
},
{
    514.96,516.42
     or just a block of wood.
},
{
    516.42,518.58
     I call this the calf smashing circuit,
},
{
    518.58,521.3
     and if your calf had a butt, this would kick it.
},
{
    521.3,523.34
     So I'm going to step up onto that stair
},
{
    523.34,530.0
     or that yoga block to the point where my heels are going to be off, my toes are going to be on. If you are in a staircase,
},
{
    530.0,533.76
     just take your hands, grab off to the side right here on those walls for support. If
},
{
    533.76,537.88
     you are doing an X to a wall, just grab onto it like this. What I'm going to do first is
},
{
    537.88,542.56
     a simple calf raise. That is just lifting up with my feet, trying to take my heels up
},
{
    542.56,547.76
     towards the ceiling. Try to focus on feeling and activating those calf muscles.
},
{
    547.76,551.8
     Through all of these exercises, you should really feel it into the calves.
},
{
    551.8,555.84
     So what you want to do is go to a comfortable point of activation of those muscles, hold
},
{
    555.84,557.44
     this for five seconds.
},
{
    557.44,563.2
     From there, come back down, relax, take a breather, and then repeat this up to 10 times.
},
{
    563.2,566.24
     With each repetition, really focus on driving up even more
},
{
    566.24,569.28
     to challenge yourself to help strengthen those muscles.
},
{
    569.28,570.84
     From there, we want to do the opposite.
},
{
    570.84,573.6
     So let's go all the way up and then do a heel drop.
},
{
    573.6,576.08
     That is just slowly coming down to the point
},
{
    576.08,578.1
     where my heels are going down towards the floor.
},
{
    578.1,581.64
     Do let them touch the floor though, just let them hover.
},
{
    581.64,583.4
     This should take you about five seconds
},
{
    583.4,589.76
     from going to the top all the way down to the bottom and really fight gravity and your body weight. What you want
},
{
    589.76,594.48
     to do for this one is 10 complete repetitions. If this becomes too easy, what you can do
},
{
    594.48,599.32
     from there is just take one leg off and then repeat those exercises. It will definitely
},
{
    599.32,603.9
     become more challenging because you have more body weight to deal with. Once you're done
},
{
    603.9,607.38
     with that, what we want is to focus on more dynamic movements,
},
{
    607.38,610.84
     challenge those muscles through different motions.
},
{
    610.84,613.64
     What I'm going to do is what is called an eccentric calf raise.
},
{
    613.64,616.08
     So I'm going to tilt my body just a little bit
},
{
    616.08,618.48
     towards one direction, in this case my right,
},
{
    618.48,620.38
     and then I'm going to repeat that calf raise.
},
{
    620.38,622.28
     When you do this, you'll notice that the muscles
},
{
    622.28,624.58
     get hit just a little bit differently.
},
{
    624.58,629.3
     And you want to repeat this one again for five second holds for ten repetitions.
},
{
    629.3,634.76
     From there, go all the way towards the left and repeat. Experiment with different angles.
},
{
    634.76,638.64
     If one feels very weak, like let's say when I go to my right, it just feels very weak
},
{
    638.64,646.56
     compared to the left. I make note of that and I throw more repetitions in to help strengthen those muscles to hopefully, again,
},
{
    646.56,649.82
     future proof them from pain and tightness.
},
{
    649.82,652.58
     You can also do circular motions like this,
},
{
    652.58,654.94
     but you just want to do that and then from there,
},
{
    654.94,658.22
     switch to doing the heel drops and do that same motion.
},
{
    658.22,660.9
     Go all the way towards the left, go down a little bit,
},
{
    660.9,662.32
     and then go all the way towards the right
},
{
    662.32,669.06
     and focus on any motions with that heel drop that feel a little bit more weak. And if it does feel like it's too
},
{
    669.06,673.18
     easy just take one leg off and repeat this. But whatever you do on one side
},
{
    673.18,677.94
     always switch to the other to keep them both in balance. So if you stuck around
},
{
    677.94,681.9
     to the end of the video you're going to be rewarded with a great exercise that's
},
{
    681.9,685.44
     not only going to target the calves, but pretty much the whole legs,
},
{
    685.44,691.44
     glutes, buttocks, core muscles, and lower back. This one is known as the calf bridge. It's best done
},
{
    691.44,695.84
     on the floor. Let's lay it flat on her back, put her head down like this. What I'm going to do from
},
{
    695.84,702.4
     here is raise my heels up towards the ceiling as much as I can and drive my leg weight into my
},
{
    702.4,705.0
     toes into the floor for a stable anchor point.
},
{
    705.0,706.48
     From there, hands go on the hip,
},
{
    706.48,709.32
     and I'm going to lift my butt up towards the ceiling
},
{
    709.32,710.32
     as much as I can.
},
{
    710.32,713.24
     You want to pretty much have your knees to the hips,
},
{
    713.24,715.52
     to the shoulders, in a nice straight line.
},
{
    715.52,718.96
     Really focus on feeling this into the calf muscles.
},
{
    718.96,721.12
     If it doesn't feel like it's really activating them,
},
{
    721.12,724.04
     what you need to do is lift the heels up even more
},
{
    724.04,727.88
     until you feel it. Once we hit that very comfortable activation of the muscles,
},
{
    727.88,732.2
     and I'm telling you what, it activates a lot of muscles in this exercise. Let's
},
{
    732.2,736.5
     hold this for five seconds. From there, relax, take a breather, and then repeat
},
{
    736.5,741.1
     this one up to ten times. With each repetition, drive the heels up towards
},
{
    741.1,746.4
     the ceiling, lift the butt up even more to challenge those muscles to hopefully strengthen everything,
},
{
    746.4,750.62
     and again, future-proof things from pain and tightness.
},
{
    750.62,751.96
     If this becomes too easy,
},
{
    751.96,755.4
     you can take one leg off like this and repeat,
},
{
    755.4,757.44
     and it becomes extremely challenging.
},
{
    757.44,759.56
     So try that one, and remember,
},
{
    759.56,761.2
     whatever you do on one side,
},
{
    761.2,764.8
     always switch to the other to keep them both in balance.
