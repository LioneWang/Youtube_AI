     Aloha everyone. Today we're talking about blocked tear ducts and blocked tear ducts happen and adults and kids
},
{
    7.72,13.0
     are gonna talk about babies today because I'm a pediatric ophthalmologist and that's what I do.
},
{
    13.64,15.72
     So a blocked tear duct, what is it?
},
{
    16.04,21.66
     That is when you bring your newborn baby home and you notice that their eyes are tearing,
},
{
    21.66,29.92
     they are swollen shut, there's so much gunk in the eyes and it's constantly running tears down their face. That is a blocked tear
},
{
    29.92,34.32
     duct and all it is is an extra little piece of membrane, a little tissue that
},
{
    34.32,39.48
     just didn't open up when the babies were born. Happens in about 5% of newborns so
},
{
    39.48,44.84
     it's super common. Actually all three of my kids had it and in itself it is not
},
{
    44.84,45.56
     worrisome.
},
{
    45.56,47.56
     It doesn't cause any vision damage.
},
{
    47.56,50.72
     But the thing is you want to make sure that that's actually what it is.
},
{
    50.72,56.6
     There are a lot of things that can cause tearing, redness, discharge, which are serious.
},
{
    56.6,61.2
     So you always want to get your baby checked out by a pediatric ophthalmologist or your
},
{
    61.2,64.88
     pediatrician to make sure that there's not anything more serious going on.
},
{
    64.88,68.02
     But let's say your pediatrician or your pediatric ophthalmologist did diagnose
},
{
    68.02,74.32
     your baby with a blocked tear duct. Now what? First, how do you clean it? Eyes are
},
{
    74.32,78.0
     swollen shut. You want to just be as gentle as possible of course with newborn
},
{
    78.0,82.48
     skin. So just some cotton tips, you know, some little, you can use little q-tips,
},
{
    82.48,86.6
     little cotton balls, wet it with warm water,
},
{
    86.6,89.56
     and just really gently clean the eyelets open,
},
{
    89.56,92.42
     little washcloth is fine too.
},
{
    92.42,94.48
     Then the most important thing that you can do
},
{
    94.48,96.52
     is something called craigler massage.
},
{
    96.52,98.16
     And what craigler massage is,
},
{
    98.16,101.62
     is it's a way of increasing the pressure
},
{
    101.62,103.6
     in the nasal lacrimal system.
},
{
    103.6,106.46
     You know, where your tears drain in this inner corner,
},
{
    106.46,109.54
     there's a little hole in the top and bottom called the puncta.
},
{
    109.54,111.18
     And they go down into your nose
},
{
    111.18,112.38
     and that's where your tears drain.
},
{
    112.38,114.84
     So that's why you get a runny nose when you cry.
},
{
    114.84,117.1
     So in these babies, they've got that little,
},
{
    117.1,120.18
     like a blocked tear duct is all it is, is like a clogged drain.
},
{
    120.18,122.3
     So the tears are overflowing,
},
{
    122.3,123.78
     like a clogged drain through the front.
},
{
    123.78,128.72
     So we wanna open up that passageway and the massage by actually doing it properly
},
{
    128.72,132.52
     creates this pressure that kind of sucks everything in and helps open the
},
{
    132.52,137.24
     passageway up. So you want to do it three types a day, five times each time. So what
},
{
    137.24,140.84
     you're doing is you're going to push right in the inner corner of the nose
},
{
    140.84,149.24
     that bony prominence and then you're going to roll your finger down all the way towards your nose. Now unfortunately I've seen a lot of videos
},
{
    149.24,154.0
     and a lot of blog posts demonstrating the technique of massage for black tear
},
{
    154.0,158.4
     ducts and and it's incorrect. You're not like rolling your finger all around here
},
{
    158.4,161.92
     that's not what we're doing. We are actually just really simply applying
},
{
    161.92,168.88
     pressure and then rolling your finger down. It's not like a massaging motion of the actual hole right there. That's not
},
{
    168.88,174.28
     it. So you want to do that five times three times a day. The other thing you
},
{
    174.28,177.12
     know your pediatrician or your pediatric ophthalmologist might recommend
},
{
    177.12,180.76
     antibiotic ointment. If there's a lot of gunk and there's a lot of crusting and
},
{
    180.76,186.0
     the baby just can't even open their eyes. Breast milk has also been shown to be effective.
},
{
    186.0,187.92
     There's a lot of great immunoglobulins.
},
{
    187.92,193.32
     I actually did that for my kids and I found it even more effective than using the antibiotic
},
{
    193.32,195.0
     ointment truth be told.
},
{
    195.0,199.72
     So these are the techniques you want to do for how to actually perform blocked tear duct
},
{
    199.72,200.72
     effectively.
},
{
    200.72,207.08
     I'm sorry, cryglar massage, how to perform craigler massage effectively to improve
},
{
    207.08,208.52
     your baby's symptoms.
},
{
    208.52,214.84
     95% of the time these blocked tear ducts resolve spontaneously, find themselves with this massage.
},
{
    214.84,216.88
     If you do the massage, it really will help.
},
{
    216.88,222.96
     5% of the time we actually have to take a baby to surgery and insert these tiny little
},
{
    222.96,227.24
     metal tubes through the hole all the way down into the nose to
},
{
    227.24,230.0
     puncture the membrane open.
},
{
    230.0,234.16
     But if you do the massage most of the time it is going to help so it's really important
},
{
    234.16,235.16
     you know the proper technique.

{
    235.16,237.08
