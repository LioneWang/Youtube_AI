     Hi, I'm Zach.
},
{
    9.3,14.0
     If you've been suffering from heel pain or Achilles tendonitis for years, this episode's
},
{
    14.0,15.0
     for you.
},
{
    15.0,18.92
     We're going to show you today how to fix Achilles heel pain, not by fixing the calf or the
},
{
    18.92,21.36
     Achilles, but by fixing the hips.
},
{
    21.36,24.24
     But before we do that, we're going to show you an athlete that suffered from Achilles
},
{
    24.24,29.28
     heel pain and did our testing and protocol and was able to get back into running and jumping again.
},
{
    35.28,38.72
     Achilles tendonitis for how long? About a month and a half now.
},
{
    40.8,46.0
     About a month and a half. And now so his goal is to get to 10 pounds.
},
{
    46.0,48.0
     And once he gets to 10 pounds,
},
{
    48.0,53.0
     that's where we're going to see the Achilles tendonitis go away.
},
{
    53.0,55.0
     Still in any sorts of inversion, it was extremely weak.
},
{
    55.0,60.0
     But what he went this way, and this is the side where the Achilles tendonitis is,
},
{
    60.0,62.0
     when he went this way, he's really strong here.
},
{
    62.0,65.32
     And most athletes, they get injured at the strength not the weakness
},
{
    76.52,78.52
     So the reason why this athlete
},
{
    78.8,84.68
     Developed Achilles pain or heel pain is because of a weakness in the groin and a weakness in the post to be Alice and the reason
},
{
    84.68,88.92
     Why a weakness in the groin and a weakness in the post tibialis. And the reason why a weakness in the groin would cause heel pain or Achilles tendonitis
},
{
    88.92,89.92
     is very simple.
},
{
    89.92,92.52
     The body goes, you know what, I don't have the strength through the groin.
},
{
    92.52,96.24
     So I'm going to put a little bit more pressure down in the soleus and down in the Achilles
},
{
    96.24,99.8
     that's ultimately what leads to Achilles tendonitis or heel pain.
},
{
    99.8,102.84
     So what I'm going to do today is I'm going to show you how to test the groin and then
},
{
    102.84,107.44
     I'm also going to show you a little bit different variation on how to test the post tibialis.
},
{
    107.44,112.72
     So in episode three we went extensively over how to test both the post tibialis and the
},
{
    112.72,114.2
     perineus.
},
{
    114.2,119.32
     So you can go back and review that episode for more information on how to test those.
},
{
    119.32,122.92
     But I'm just going to show you a little bit different variation today on the post tibialis
},
{
    122.92,125.06
     when you're dealing with Achilles tendonitis.
},
{
    125.06,127.94
     So in the other episode,
},
{
    127.94,132.1
     I showed you when you're coming up to pull the toes back.
},
{
    132.1,133.58
     Don't pull the toes back on this
},
{
    133.58,135.02
     because it's gonna put more pressure on the heels.
},
{
    135.02,137.28
     There's a muscle that runs right up into the heel here.
},
{
    137.28,138.82
     So when you do that,
},
{
    138.82,141.54
     that's gonna put a lot of torque back on the heel.
},
{
    141.54,144.94
     So you wanna just keep the toes neutral
},
{
    144.94,145.04
     when you lift up and down. And another thing you can do is, besides using, I showed dumbbells, to put a lot of torque back on the heel. So you want to just keep the toes neutral when
},
{
    145.04,149.52
     you lift up and down. Another thing you can do is besides using, I showed dumbbells, you
},
{
    149.52,153.28
     can also just take an ankle weight, roll it over and you can just come up and down like
},
{
    153.28,159.76
     that. So just go and review episode three for that testing and you can apply that to
},
{
    159.76,166.52
     someone that has an Achilles injury. But today what we're going to do is we're going to
},
{
    166.52,176.16
     address how to test the groin. Alright so very simple. I'm showing you here two
},
{
    176.16,182.84
     and a half pounds okay five this is two and a half and five is going to be more
},
{
    182.84,185.0
     on the on the weaker range here. Seven and a half to 5 is going to be more on the weaker range here.
},
{
    185.0,190.0
     7.5 to 10 is going to be on the stronger range.
},
{
    190.0,193.0
     This is what we want to work the athletes up to. This is how you know they don't have a weakness.
},
{
    193.0,198.0
     So here's how the exercises work for testing the Magnus.
},
{
    198.0,201.0
     All we're going to do is we're going to lay on our side just like this.
},
{
    201.0,204.0
     This should be light. You don't want to pose over here.
},
{
    204.0,209.52
     You want to stay a little bit open chain here. You want to stay open chain here. You're going to notice too that my
},
{
    209.52,214.48
     foot is turned down. You don't want to be doing this because this is going to get more into the
},
{
    214.48,219.2
     top of the adductor's into the hip flexor. What we're trying to do is we're trying to
},
{
    219.2,225.36
     concentrate here on testing the magnet. The athlete should only feel it in the Magnus area here. So when
},
{
    225.36,232.24
     you lift up, just like this, we're going to do 15 reps to test. And what I'm looking
},
{
    232.24,235.88
     for here is you're going to see athletes are going to want to do this. That's how you
},
{
    235.88,241.66
     know they're weak. And also, if they do this and they feel it more up into the hip flexor
},
{
    241.66,249.08
     chain here and not into the Magnus, then know there's a weakness and also if they feel it into their
},
{
    249.48,253.46
     Glute medius back here. They'll do this exercise and what they're doing it
},
{
    253.46,257.68
     They'll feel it in their glute medius. That's how you know immediately look the growing Magnus is weak
},
{
    257.68,264.32
     So what it's doing is it's recruiting more of the the medius because both the both the adductors and
},
{
    264.7,269.0
     or the medius because both the adductors and the medius work together to medially rotate the leg
},
{
    269.0,271.0
     so they're interconnected and that's why
},
{
    271.0,272.56
     if there's a weakness in the magnets,
},
{
    272.56,274.0
     what it's gonna do is it's gonna go,
},
{
    274.0,276.2
     you know what, I'm gonna recruit more of the glute medius
},
{
    276.2,277.84
     in order to do this exercise.
},
{
    277.84,282.16
     So again, I'm just lying here and I'm coming up and down.
},
{
    282.16,287.16
     And over time, if you see that there's a weakness,
},
{
    289.46,290.76
     even with two and a half pounds,
},
{
    290.76,292.2
     I'm gonna show you a different variation
},
{
    292.2,296.9
     that you can use in order to recruit the groin magnets
},
{
    296.9,299.54
     and then go back to these weights here
},
{
    299.54,301.6
     in order to effectively activate it.
},
{
    303.48,306.68
     So if the athlete fails that test and he doesn't feel it in
},
{
    306.68,310.8
     his growing magnets, he feels it more into the hip flexor or also into the
},
{
    310.8,315.24
     glute minimus medius area, then there's two things that you have to consider.
},
{
    315.24,320.16
     First is, and a lot in the prior episodes we talked a lot about how to test the
},
{
    320.16,323.8
     glute minimus and the importance of it. Well if the glute minimus isn't working
},
{
    323.8,328.8
     efficiently, the adductor chain doesn't work as efficiently. So by strengthening up the minimus,
},
{
    328.8,335.84
     we'll also help to activate and get the groin functioning correctly with the rest of the hip
},
{
    335.84,343.76
     muscles. Secondly is this is what we do. If the athlete does not feel in the madness from that test,
},
{
    343.76,345.56
     this is the best way to do it.
},
{
    345.56,349.0
     You can get towels or these are just some pads here
},
{
    349.0,350.32
     for some cushion.
},
{
    350.32,352.08
     What we're gonna do is we're gonna put our legs
},
{
    352.08,354.96
     very low here and we're just gonna squeeze.
},
{
    354.96,357.32
     And the athlete's gonna feel it right into the groin area.
},
{
    357.32,359.36
     There's no way out of that.
},
{
    359.36,361.96
     If you put the legs up too far into hip flexion,
},
{
    361.96,364.44
     when you do this, if the athlete has a weakness
},
{
    364.44,365.04
     in the groin
},
{
    365.04,370.16
     or in the minimus, it's going to go, even though they're in adduction here, it's going to go right
},
{
    370.16,375.36
     into the TFL. So you've got to make sure that you keep the legs low and then you just squeeze.
},
{
    375.36,381.2
     So then what I do is I get the glute minimus strong using the testing method in some of the prior
},
{
    381.2,386.2
     episodes. And then I also do this exercise here for two weeks
},
{
    386.2,392.64
     and get this functioning properly and then I go back in and I start strengthening up
},
{
    392.64,396.12
     just like the test exercise that I demonstrated initially.
