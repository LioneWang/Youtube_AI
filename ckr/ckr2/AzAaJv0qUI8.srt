     Brad Heineck, physical therapist.
},

    14.24,16.16
     We are the most famous physical therapists on the internet.
},
{
    16.16,17.56
     In our opinion, of course, Bob.
},
{
    17.56,19.66
     Today we're gonna show you how to get rid of neck pain
},
{
    19.66,21.32
     from sleeping wrong.
},
{
    21.32,23.6
     This is something that just happened to somebody
},
{
    23.6,24.56
     I live with.
},
{
    24.56,25.94
     Oh, wonderful.
},
{
    25.94,28.14
     She doesn't like when I mention her name, so.
},

    28.14,29.66

     We're giving a sleep-ovation table
},
{
    48.46,52.64
     that has a UV light on it that can help clean things.
},
{
    52.64,54.1
     What, it's not a table?
},
{
    54.1,55.04
     Sleep-ovation?
},
{
    55.04,57.62
     Oh, not sleep-ovation, flex-a-spot.
},
{
    57.62,58.46
     Flex-a-spot.
},
{
    58.46,60.34
     Sorry about flex-a-spot.
},
{
    60.34,62.56
     I have sleep-ovation on the mind.
},
{
    62.56,65.28
     All right, you can also go to Instagram and Twitter
},
{
    65.28,68.2
     for a one minute version of our program,
},
{
    68.2,69.8
     or you go to Facebook and it'll be pinned
},
{
    69.8,73.04
     at the top of the page as far as the contest is concerned.
},
{
    73.04,74.12
     Excellent job.
},
{
    74.12,77.76
     So yes, approximately a week ago,
},
{
    77.76,81.2
     this person I live with woke up with a very stiff neck.
},
{
    81.2,83.34
     And I don't want to tell her how it happened,
},
{
    83.34,86.64
     but she was sleeping on the couch with her head forward
},
{
    86.64,89.48
     and bad posture for a long period of time.
},
{
    89.48,93.68
     So immediately what we had her do is we just had to take
},
{
    93.68,97.36
     a rolled towel and Brad's going to demonstrate here
},
{
    97.36,100.76
     and what he did or what she did is actually worked on
},
{
    100.76,106.12
     trying to gently start doing some cervical or neck extensions.
},
{
    106.12,109.04
     Brad, do you wanna use a chair or what do you wanna do?
},
{
    109.04,112.0
     Yeah, let's use a chair so I can go.
},
{
    112.0,113.72
     I'm gonna go ahead and handle the camera here.
},
{
    113.72,116.88
     Again, we don't have a camera person right now.
},
{
    116.88,117.98
     We're on our own.
},
{
    118.96,119.8
     We can do it, Bob.
},
{
    119.8,120.84
     This is the way we used to do it.
},
{
    120.84,121.68
     That's right.
},
{
    121.68,123.08
     Just how we did it from the beginning.
},
{
    123.08,124.64
     The old days coming back.
},
{
    124.64,125.48
     Yeah.
},
{
    125.48,127.2
     So I'm gonna take the towel roll wrapped up.
},
{
    127.2,130.16
     We have some tape around here, that's the red stripes.
},
{
    130.16,132.8
     And that's to keep it so it doesn't fall apart.
},
{
    132.8,134.56
     Yeah, you don't necessarily need that, but.
},
{
    134.56,136.64
     No, there you go.
},
{
    136.64,139.52
     All right, so what did you ever do first, Bob?
},
{
    139.52,142.48
     Well, first, you know, if she tried it without the towel,
},
{
    142.48,143.36
     it just didn't work.
},
{
    143.36,144.28
     It was too painful.
},
{
    144.28,145.16
     Yeah, so you're going?
},
{
    145.16,148.0
     Yeah, it was, it was very stiff.
},
{
    148.0,150.52
     So we just started having her take the towel
},
{
    150.52,155.44
     and I had her put some counter pressure against the neck.
},
{
    155.44,156.44
     So she would pull those things.
},
{
    156.44,157.4
     Pull that way, yeah.
},
{
    157.4,158.24
     Gently.
},
{
    158.24,160.4
     And just started working on extensions.
},
{
    160.4,163.04
     Now you can have your back up against the chair too,
},
{
    163.04,165.52
     if you, yeah, especially if you have a decent chair
},
{
    165.52,167.28
     with a decent back.
},
{
    167.28,169.64
     Now did you have her hold here or a little bit of?
},
{
    169.64,170.48
     A little bit of both.
},
{
    170.48,172.8
     A little bit of, you know, whatever felt comfortable,
},
{
    172.8,175.04
     that whatever was letting her extend back,
},
{
    175.04,176.32
     that's what we're doing.
},
{
    176.32,178.76
     So typically you'll go back a little farther,
},
{
    178.76,181.44
     it feels better with the support.
},
{
    181.44,185.94
     And it may take a few repetitions or even more, you know, throughout the day
},
{
    185.94,188.12
     before it starts to really go back.
},
{
    188.12,190.12
     And the pain goes down with the range of motion
},
{
    190.12,192.04
     as it increases, typically.
},
{
    192.04,195.2
     It immediately helps some.
},
{
    195.2,197.8
     And then over the course of the next day or two,
},
{
    197.8,199.26
     it went away.
},
{
    199.26,202.4
     But in addition to that, what you can also try
},
{
    202.4,204.28
     is you can try some rotations, Brad.
},
{
    204.28,205.4
     Do you want to go ahead and try those?
},
{
    205.4,206.8
     Sure.
},
{
    206.8,208.56
     You're gonna go back up to the bed, okay?
},
{
    208.56,211.04
     All right, so we're just gonna keep good posture,
},
{
    211.04,214.76
     not slouched, bring the shoulders back here,
},
{
    214.76,216.32
     and we're gonna use this, right, Brad?
},
{
    216.32,220.56
     So let's say Brad has trouble turning to the left, his left.
},
{
    220.56,221.4
     Oh.
},
{
    221.4,223.12
     Yep, it just doesn't wanna go.
},
{
    223.12,225.08
     You can, this Brad's gonna show you now,
},
{
    225.08,228.16
     you can pull down on the towel on the left,
},
{
    228.16,229.56
     that gets pulled down, yep.
},
{
    229.56,231.76
     And we usually cross hands over.
},
{
    231.76,235.32
     So he puts the right hand on the left towel
},
{
    235.32,237.64
     and the left hand on the right towel.
},
{
    237.64,238.48
     So then he pulls you,
},
{
    238.48,240.32
     kinda pull on your mic a little bit there, Brad.
},
{
    240.32,241.16
     But-
},
{
    241.16,242.52
     Sorry, what am I gonna do, Bob?
},
{
    242.52,243.84
     Take the rest off?
},
{
    243.84,244.68
     Go the other way.
},
{
    244.68,245.56
     Okay. So we'll Go the other way. Okay.
},
{
    245.56,247.44
     So we'll show the opposite way now.
},
{
    248.56,250.6
     These ones gonna go, turn to the right now.
},
{
    250.6,252.08
     So you're gonna pull down on the right one
},
{
    252.08,254.04
     and there he goes to the left.
},
{
    254.04,255.0
     All right, to the right.
},
{
    255.0,256.94
     Notice I keep the towel up here
},
{
    256.94,260.08
     so it goes across my jawbone and not your neck.
},
{
    260.08,261.76
     Yeah, exactly.
},
{
    261.76,262.6
     Really critical thing there.
},
{
    262.6,264.72
     It just gives nice support for the neck
},
{
    264.72,268.44
     when trying to do this and it works real well.
},
{
    268.44,271.84
     If it hurts to rotate that way,
},
{
    271.84,274.48
     you might actually work on rotating the other way
},
{
    274.48,278.28
     in order to, and then go back to the other one eventually.
},
{
    278.28,279.12
     Right.
},
{
    279.12,279.96
     It seems like that really helps.
},
{
    279.96,280.8
     Yep.
},
{
    280.8,281.76
     All right, I'm gonna come back, Brad.
},
{
    281.76,283.16
     Oh, sure, come on.
},
{
    283.16,286.04
     I'm gonna try to flip this around so I can see. All right, so the last come back Brad. Oh, sure, come on. I'm gonna try to flip this around so I can see.
},
{
    286.04,289.32
     All right, so the last thing you can try is,
},
{
    289.32,293.68
     if you're still stiff and you're lacking some side bending,
},
{
    293.68,295.16
     what we want you to do with that one
},
{
    295.16,299.12
     is actually do a chin tuck and then go to that side.
},
{
    299.12,303.04
     Don't just go to that side, chin tuck and go to that side.
},
{
    303.04,305.24
     Yeah, I can see Brad showing it from behind there.
},
{
    305.24,306.8
     Chin tuck, that side.
},
{
    306.8,308.2
     If you're gonna go the other direction,
},
{
    308.2,310.52
     chin tuck, and this direction.
},
{
    310.52,312.52
     So just so you guys could tell,
},
{
    312.52,316.04
     I'm back behind the table, maintaining my six feet distance.
},
{
    316.04,317.88
     That's right, I can't reach him.
},
{
    317.88,320.88
     He's back there, but I don't know.
},
{
    320.88,324.32
     I guess we both were not really exposed
},
{
    325.36,327.88
     as far as breath wise, but we were exposed
},
{
    327.88,330.64
     as far as touching surfaces possibly, right?
},
{
    330.64,332.08
     Yeah, that potential exists.
},
{
    332.08,335.84
     Yeah, so we've been trying to use disinfectant
},
{
    335.84,338.0
     and wash our hands and use gloves and all that,
},
{
    338.0,339.92
     and we're out of there now, so hopefully.
},
{
    339.92,341.44
     Right, yep.
},
{
    341.44,343.92
     So everybody, please stay safe out there.
},
{
    343.92,346.56
     We'll all get through this together.
},
{
    346.56,350.94
     We just gotta use some ingenuity and have some faith.
},
{
    350.94,353.68
     Yep, and just relax, do what you're supposed to do
},
{
    353.68,354.8
     and read a book.
},
{
    354.8,None
     All right, thanks for watching. you
},
