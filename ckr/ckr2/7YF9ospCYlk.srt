     Hi, I'm Zach and today's episode we're going to show you how to get to a 400 pound bench
},
{
    13.6,16.72
     by properly training the lats and also the tries.
},
{
    16.72,20.76
     But in today's episode we're just going to focus on the lats and then in next week's
},
{
    20.76,29.0
     episode we're going to focus on the tries.
},
{
    29.0,30.0
     So this is Nick.
},
{
    30.0,37.32
     He's been training with me for a decade and he started his bench out here at about 165.
},
{
    37.32,39.08
     What's your bench max now?
},
{
    39.08,40.22
     375.
},
{
    40.22,43.44
     So pretty good improvement.
},
{
    43.44,47.92
     And so what we're going to do today is we're going to talk about the lats here of how I train them to get up to that.
},
{
    48.16,50.96
     And we're going to show you is today is the difference between
},
{
    51.84,55.36
     Doing a wide grip and really focus on focusing on scapular retraction
},
{
    55.68,61.68
     And then doing a close grip and focusing and doing more of a low row and focusing more on just the lats
},
{
    61.76,67.56
     You want to train both you want to train the scapular retractors are going to be more of your your rhomboids and your
},
{
    67.56,70.62
     posterior delt and then we're going to show you just how to isolate the lats.
},
{
    70.62,75.3
     You want to be doing both exercises in order to drive up your bench and make
},
{
    75.3,79.18
     your lats extremely strong. The scapular retraction we always just go straight
},
{
    79.18,84.46
     bar pronated with the with the palms facing down and we go a little wider
},
{
    84.46,89.48
     around here. You can also go out here and he's focusing on retracting his shoulder
},
{
    89.48,95.6
     blades and he's keeping it almost a fist length in front of him go ahead and
},
{
    95.6,98.8
     this way he can really go ahead up back and forward this way you can really
},
{
    98.8,103.76
     focus on scapular retraction and if you're doing it right you're stopping
},
{
    103.76,109.36
     right where your scaps stop okay so right where you can pinch your shoulder blades back, that's
},
{
    109.36,113.6
     where he stopped. And the reason is, is because if he goes, go ahead and just try
},
{
    113.6,116.92
     to pull and let your shoulders around, pull all the way back. That's what a lot
},
{
    116.92,120.52
     of people end up doing. Go ahead and do it again. They try to pull all the way
},
{
    120.52,125.04
     back and then they end up using their internal rotators here and also
},
{
    125.04,131.24
     their upper trapezius to create the action rather than focusing on the retractors and
},
{
    131.24,135.92
     really developing the hell out of your rhomboids and your rear delts.
},
{
    135.92,140.46
     That's the objective of this exercise and if you notice here, go ahead, he's just a
},
{
    140.46,144.28
     couple three inches above his belly button, okay?
},
{
    144.28,145.44
     And now we're going to show you the next one.
},
{
    147.12,152.48
     Keep in mind too, when you're trying to work on the scapular retraction exercise with a wide grip,
},
{
    152.48,158.4
     we are breaking that bar in half. We're trying to have that feeling so the elbows stay in.
},
{
    158.4,162.24
     The reason we're doing that is because we're externally rotating. We're trying to engage
},
{
    162.24,165.04
     the external rotators in for spinatus, posterior delt, so that we don to engage the external rotators and for spinatus post
},
{
    165.04,169.56
     your adult so that we don't engage the internal rotators and do this. As soon as you break
},
{
    169.56,174.0
     that bar those scaps are going to be forced to stop and that's how we get the athlete
},
{
    174.0,178.82
     to really lock in place and keep it a fist length away.
},
{
    178.82,187.96
     So the next grip what he's doing is, so hold on take a break, don't only do what I say now it's good so the next
},
{
    187.96,192.32
     grip he's taking is going to be actually a closer grip and the reason is is
},
{
    192.32,196.56
     because we're going to focus on the lats the wider you go it's more like doing
},
{
    196.56,200.76
     like a rear like a rear delt exercise here when you're going like this okay
},
{
    200.76,204.56
     that's why the water you go the more posterior delt that you're going to focus
},
{
    204.56,205.82
     on the closer grip that you go the more more posterior delt that you're going to focus on, the closer
},
{
    205.82,210.56
     grip that you go, the more narrow you go, the more it's going to hit up the lats.
},
{
    210.56,212.9
     He's actually on this, he's going to go really low, go ahead.
},
{
    212.9,216.18
     And he's going to let his shoulders round forward slightly as he leans back.
},
{
    216.18,217.18
     Go ahead.
},
{
    217.18,221.3
     And now he's getting completely into the lats.
},
{
    221.3,222.78
     Go ahead, come forward a little bit more.
},
{
    222.78,223.78
     And now lat, yep.
},
{
    223.78,228.78
     And notice how he's rolling just a little bit forward to touch and look at so he was
},
{
    228.78,232.0
     three inches above with it when he was doing the retraction.
},
{
    232.0,233.0
     Now he's doing low row.
},
{
    233.0,235.08
     Look at how low he is right down to his navel.
},
{
    235.08,250.16
     And that's what gets right into the side of the lat right there. And also with the narrow grip low row, the reason that you are going low is because we
},
{
    250.16,253.32
     want to take the upper trapezius out of the equation.
},
{
    253.32,256.36
     If you try to pull higher, now you're involving this.
},
{
    256.36,261.28
     If we go low, even though the shoulders row forward slightly, it's still targeting the
},
{
    261.28,265.04
     lats and taking everything away from the upper trapezius.
},
{
    265.04,273.32
     And now do the other one so go wide grip. Okay and now see now that's all
},
{
    273.32,275.4
     post-serial delts so that's the difference between the two and look at how
},
{
    275.4,280.2
     much higher that is. So you want to do both you want to do a low row and then
},
{
    280.2,283.32
     you want to do a scapular attraction exercise the low row is going to really
},
{
    283.32,289.2
     tie into lats and the scapular attraction exercise is going to tie into the rhomboids and the rear delts.
},
{
    289.2,293.92
     But now we can do a high, we can do a lat pull the exact same way. So what he's going to do is
},
{
    293.92,298.56
     he's going to take a wider grip and he's going to go down, go ahead and he's going to pinch the
},
{
    298.56,304.88
     scaps and notice how he's staying almost a fist length away. Go ahead. Now watch, go ahead and
},
{
    304.88,306.24
     try to touch your chest. Watch what happens
},
{
    306.24,310.08
     to a shoulder blade. Go ahead. See how they're going to rotate and roll. That's what we don't want
},
{
    310.08,316.72
     to do. Okay, go ahead and rest. So do it again right. So this is all rhomboid now and rear delt.
},
{
    316.72,321.6
     Okay, like you're doing a reverse fly. Okay, now we're going to do narrow grip. What I like doing
},
{
    321.6,328.44
     when I'm up above here is I like doing a chin, a more like a chin up grip okay so what and you can do this way but we're
},
{
    328.44,332.96
     gonna now make it narrow so we're gonna take that reverse fly action out of it
},
{
    332.96,335.96
     and we're gonna focus just on the line he's gonna touch way down low and lean
},
{
    335.96,340.24
     way back go ahead yep and he's gonna let the shoulders round forward just a
},
{
    340.24,345.08
     hair and it's gonna be all black. Go a little lower.
},
{
    346.12,346.96
     Yep, that's good.
},
{
    348.04,350.0
     So see how he's like right at sternum level.
},
{
    350.0,351.36
     Now turn the hands over.
},
{
    353.52,354.44
     Good.
},
{
    354.44,355.52
     And now go ahead.
},
{
    356.56,359.72
     See, he's right down here, right below the sternum.
},
{
    359.72,361.72
     He can go a little lower if he wants to.
},
{
    361.72,363.0
     Like that, there it is.
