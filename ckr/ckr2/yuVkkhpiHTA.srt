     Hi, I'm Kendra. I'm a physical therapist at the University of Michigan Milestones specializing in pediatric rehabilitation.
},
{
    6.56,14.56
     I'm here to share with you today some ideas to improve your child's fine motor and gross motor skills all with things that you can find lying around your house.
},
{
    14.56,19.68
     So let's get started. One of the skills we work on most frequently in physical therapy is balance.
},
{
    19.68,24.68
     And I've really found that a basic 2x4 is a great way to improve balance with a kid.
},
{
    24.68,25.2
     So you can ask your child to improve balance with a kid.
},
{
    25.2,27.92
     So you can ask your child to walk across the balance beam.
},
{
    27.92,30.32
     So go ahead, Greg, walk across the balance beam.
},
{
    30.32,34.48
     And now if you're out in the community, you could use a curb or even cracks in a sidewalk
},
{
    34.48,35.48
     to improve balance.
},
{
    35.48,36.48
     Good.
},
{
    36.48,39.12
     And if that's too easy, have your child start again at the beginning.
},
{
    39.12,40.28
     Come on over here.
},
{
    40.28,44.56
     And you can increase the challenge by having them walk across the balance beam and pick
},
{
    44.56,47.04
     up objects from the ground or step over things.
},
{
    47.04,52.24
     So go ahead, Greg, go ahead and step over there and pick those objects up.
},
{
    52.24,55.78
     You can also do things like even playing a game on a balance beam to increase the challenge
},
{
    55.78,57.56
     of this activity.
},
{
    57.56,60.84
     Another skill that we work on frequently in therapy is dynamic balance, which refers
},
{
    60.84,64.4
     to a child's ability to stand on an uneven or wobbly surface.
},
{
    64.4,70.0
     So we've got Anna here on a kind of a squishy foam, but you could easily use like a couch cushion or a pillow.
},
{
    70.0,73.0
     We've upped the challenge with Emmy, she's standing on a pool noodle.
},
{
    73.0,79.0
     And this would be great to work on maybe while you're watching TV, during commercials, or while you're playing a board game.
},
{
    79.0,84.0
     Another great way to work on finger and hand strengthening is Play-Doh, and you can buy it commercially,
},
{
    84.0,86.6
     or even find lots of recipes online to make your own.
},
{
    86.6,89.78
     You know the great thing about Play-Doh is almost all activities require use of two
},
{
    89.78,92.92
     hands which is an important skill for younger kids.
},
{
    92.92,96.8
     So first let's take our Play-Doh and roll it into a snake.
},
{
    96.8,100.44
     So we're going to keep our fingers straight and roll it back and forth.
},
{
    100.44,102.52
     Good, nice and long.
},
{
    102.52,107.28
     And now we'll take our snake and stack it up and smash it into a pancake as hard as
},
{
    107.28,112.0
     you can, push it together as hard as you can, squish, squish, squish, squish.
},
{
    112.0,113.0
     Good.
},
{
    113.0,116.96
     To further work on these fine motor skills, you can hide small things like beads into
},
{
    116.96,121.88
     the Play-Doh, roll it up, and then have your child try to pick out the treasures.
},
{
    121.88,127.96
     Another great skill to work on over the summer is hand-eye coordination. Hand-eye coordination is good not only for sports and play
},
{
    127.96,131.52
     activities but also for fine motor skills like copying words down from the
},
{
    131.52,135.92
     board. So a great rainy day activity is balloon tennis and you can make your
},
{
    135.92,142.08
     racket out of a spatula or a paper plate taped to a paint stirrer. Now see how
},
{
    142.08,157.4
     many times your kids can hit the balloon back and forth without letting it hit the floor. Go ahead guys. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
},
{
    157.4,164.88
     eight, nine, we'll go to ten. Oh, nice job. Very good. For fine motor skills, one of the
},
{
    164.88,167.5
     biggest goals is to work on finger and hand strengthening.
},
{
    167.5,171.0
     And we like to do that with a game called Feed the Monster.
},
{
    171.0,174.0
     And so what you're going to do is you're going to take a tennis ball.
},
{
    174.0,175.5
     Can I see your ball for a minute, Anna?
},
{
    175.5,179.0
     And use a utility knife to cut about a 2-inch opening.
},
{
    179.0,183.0
     And then have your child decorate the face around the lips.
},
{
    183.0,190.18
     You're going to have your child hold the ball right on either side of the lips, give it a big squeeze, and then put
},
{
    190.18,194.82
     something into his mouth. Our monsters at Malisone like to eat pennies, but you
},
{
    194.82,199.24
     can feed your monster whatever you like at home. As you can see, it doesn't take
},
{
    199.24,202.92
     expensive toys or equipment to work on your child's fine and gross motor skills
},
{
    202.92,207.96
     at home. A little creativity can go a long way. If you have concerns regarding your child's
},
{
    207.96,212.04
     fine or gross motor skills, be sure to contact your pediatrician. For other
