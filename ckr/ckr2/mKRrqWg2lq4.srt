     Hi everyone, Ben Chateau here with the physical therapy advisor.
},
{
    14.64,18.68
     I wanted to talk to everyone today about neck pain.
},
{
    18.68,24.16
     I don't know about you, but occasionally I might do something a little crazy, do a workout
},
{
    24.16,30.34
     that kind of gets my neck a little sore, or even go to bed and wake up the next morning randomly with a
},
{
    30.34,35.54
     kink in my neck, right? That old like, oh, can't, can't turn my head. It kind of,
},
{
    35.54,41.46
     kind of feels stuck, right? You just can't get it to go and it's usually quite
},
{
    41.46,45.6
     painful when that happens. One of the easiest things you can do
},
{
    45.6,50.64
     is a simple McKenzie Chen Retraction. So from the side it kind of looks like this
},
{
    51.28,58.88
     and you're just going straight back. But oftentimes that's just not enough of a motion to get that
},
{
    58.88,67.36
     full turn, right? So there's another simple easy technique that works. And it's a, it's a, from a
},
{
    67.36,71.84
     Brian Mulligan is the name of the person that I got the technique from, not him directly, but from
},
{
    71.84,78.72
     his course. And I wanted to share with you because I find it so effective as a home treatment. And I
},
{
    78.72,84.0
     use it personally, you know, multiple times a year when I do something to my neck, and it just wants
},
{
    84.0,85.36
     to get all sore and locked up.
},
{
    85.36,90.8
     So it's pretty easy. What you want to do is you want to identify the direction that you can't turn
},
{
    90.8,95.2
     and maybe it's a turn, maybe it's a side bend. It actually doesn't matter.
},
{
    95.2,98.4
     Any one of those directions is what we want to work on.
},
{
    98.4,103.84
     And you'll take your middle finger primarily, though you might use these two fingers
},
{
    103.84,108.0
     and you're going to use the, put them on the back of neck. And I'll show you what we're going to do.
},
{
    108.0,113.32
     So you find the spinous process at the back of the neck here, right? And then
},
{
    113.32,117.36
     you're going to take those two fingers, right, these two fingers, and find that
},
{
    117.36,125.88
     spinous process. And then it's a rotation motion, right? You're trying to pull it and wrap it around so you grip
},
{
    125.88,134.28
     from behind and as you attempt to turn your head you're going to pull your head
},
{
    134.28,140.88
     around using your fingers on those tips of the vertebrae and you'll notice each
},
{
    140.88,145.1
     time you pull and you're trying to help the vertebrae
},
{
    145.1,148.3
     rotate the direction it wants to go anyways,
},
{
    148.3,150.06
     you'll be able to go further and further.
},
{
    150.06,153.7
     You might do five, six, seven times in a row,
},
{
    153.7,156.1
     kind of shrug around, maybe do a few of those
},
{
    156.1,161.1
     chin retractions again, and then retest yourself, right?
},
{
    161.1,163.54
     See, like, oh, it's still there,
},
{
    163.54,166.28
     but boy, I'm going 50% further.
},
{
    166.28,167.52
     That's fantastic, right?
},
{
    167.52,169.62
     You wanna do it again.
},
{
    169.62,172.88
     So you'll take those two fingers, wrap it,
},
{
    172.88,175.88
     or find the tip of the bone, come just to the side of it,
},
{
    175.88,178.4
     gather up some of that tissue that's right there,
},
{
    178.4,181.8
     turn your head and rotate as you go, right?
},
{
    181.8,185.0
     Pull down and over.
},
{
    185.0,188.32
     It's not hard, but it's enough force
},
{
    188.32,191.52
     that you can feel your head want to move.
},
{
    191.52,194.82
     So not too hard, but enough to make your head move.
},
{
    194.82,198.2
     If it increases your pain in any way,
},
{
    198.2,199.88
     stop doing it, right?
},
{
    199.88,202.24
     Or back down the pressure you're doing,
},
{
    202.24,203.32
     and then you retest.
},
{
    203.32,205.04
     What you'll find is that you'll
},
{
    205.04,210.84
     have significantly more head motion. Now most of the time if you've done something to your
},
{
    210.84,215.4
     neck it's going to get restiff. This is a technique that you'll probably have to do
},
{
    215.4,221.56
     four, five, six, maybe even ten times a day. That's okay. That's no big deal, right? As
},
{
    221.56,226.16
     long as it's staying and you know improving and it doesn't worsen your symptoms
},
{
    226.4,230.76
     Especially like down the arm or anything like that as long as it's just local neck pain
},
{
    230.84,237.0
     This technique works fantastic and don't be afraid to do it multiple times during the day as it gets stiff
},
{
    237.32,242.06
     Your body will want to stiffen back up and you just need to keep it moving, okay?
},

    242.06,246.4
