},
{
    22.28,24.36
     Boy, that's asking a lot, Brad.

     Right, that's a mouthful and we're gonna get into it
},
{
    27.36,31.5
     and that's a relatively simple treatment, if you will.
},
{
    31.5,32.76

     pinned to the top of the page on Facebook.

    54.28,55.76
     It's also in our description below.
},
{
    55.76,58.08
     Right today, what we're giving away
},
{
    58.08,60.6
     is the Renfold foot massager.
},
{
    60.6,63.44
     So this thing is really, this device is really cool.
},
{
    63.44,65.28
     So you can stick your feet in these.
},
{
    65.28,67.32
     Brad's gonna demonstrate here.
},
{
    67.32,69.48
     I'm not gonna hand them, I'm not gonna put my feet in there.
},
{
    69.48,71.84
     Yeah, and it's got different settings.
},
{
    71.84,75.16
     They'll give compression and it'll also kind of roll
},
{
    75.16,76.32
     on the bottom of your foot.
},
{
    76.32,78.24
     Right, it's got little massage balls in there.
},
{
    78.24,83.24
     And to me, like the highest setting is just barely tolerable.
},
{
    83.64,84.88
     Some younger people probably think,
},
{
    84.88,86.6
     well, I think, oh, that's perfect.
},
{
    86.6,88.48
     But so it's got something for everybody.
},
{
    88.48,91.28
     So our patients love it.
},
{
    91.28,92.32
     What about the hip, Bob?
},
{
    92.32,94.0
     Oh, let's get to the hip now.
},
{
    94.0,94.96
     I'm hip, I'm hip.
},
{
    94.96,97.28
     So extreme hip pain, you know,
},
{
    97.28,100.24
     we've dealt, Bob, and I've dealt with hip pain,
},
{
    100.24,102.48
     well, personally myself, but with patients all the time.
},
{
    102.48,103.68
     I've had it myself too.
},
{
    103.68,104.68
     Sure.
},
{
    104.68,106.28
     And I did some of these, Brad, by the way.
},
{
    106.28,108.32
     Yeah, this is something we do in the clinic
},
{
    108.32,111.32
     on a regular basis for some of the hip pain.
},
{
    111.32,112.76
     Now we're gonna look at the hip first.
},
{
    112.76,114.92
     Here we got Sam.
},
{
    114.92,117.16
     And if we look at the hip joint,
},
{
    117.16,120.48
     here we have the ball and the socket.
},
{
    120.48,121.92
     We don't have metal pieces in there,
},
{
    121.92,123.76
     at least most of us don't, hopefully.
},
{
    123.76,126.4
     But there is some connective tissue in the capsule
},
{
    126.4,128.8
     and a number of other soft tissues.
},
{
    128.8,130.24
     That's what the brown represents.
},
{
    130.24,131.56
     What we call the capsule.
},
{
    131.56,133.12
     It's this tough ligamentous stuff
},
{
    133.12,135.08
     that helps hold the hip in place.
},
{
    135.08,136.08
     Exactly.
},
{
    136.08,138.44
     So there's potential there for that to get pinched.
},
{
    138.44,139.28
     Yes.
},
{
    139.28,140.48
     There's other tissues in there.
},
{
    140.48,141.52
     I'm not gonna go too long.
},
{
    141.52,143.12
     They could get pinched in the hip.
},
{
    143.12,144.68
     That can cause severe pain.
},
{
    144.68,147.34
     Also, and most commonly, it's arthritis.
},
{
    147.34,149.66
     Right, or the labrum part of it can break off.
},
{
    149.66,150.5
     There you go.
},
{
    150.5,153.34
     Yeah, that's another part of the cartilage in there.
},
{
    153.34,155.22
     But what we're going to do now,
},
{
    155.22,158.3
     if the hip pain is consistently with weight bearing,
},
{
    158.3,160.7
     when you walk, when you put weight through the joint,
},
{
    160.7,164.54
     which is very common, if we, oh, can you see that?
},
{
    164.54,166.36
     Liz, can we zoom in? Excellent work. So, we got, we have the joint, which is very common. If we, oh, can you see that? Liz, can we zoom in?
},
{
    166.36,167.76
     Excellent work.
},
{
    167.76,171.28
     So, we got the ball and then we have it in the socket.
},
{
    171.28,173.32
     So what I'm gonna do, if it's with weight bearing,
},
{
    173.32,175.0
     that means weight's going through the femur,
},
{
    175.0,177.92
     pushing the ball into the socket, which is normal.
},
{
    177.92,180.44
     But if there's pain associated with that,
},
{
    180.44,182.88
     oftentimes if we go the opposite direction
},
{
    182.88,185.4
     and pull and separate it, that can relieve the pain instantly. And that's where we go the opposite direction and pull and separate it,
},
{
    185.4,187.76
     that can relieve the pain instantly.
},
{
    187.76,189.08
     And that's where we got the title from
},
{
    189.08,190.64
     because you do that and the person says,
},
{
    190.64,192.6
     oh my goodness, that feels better.
},
{
    192.6,194.6
     You're on to something and you're gonna work with that.
},
{
    194.6,196.52
     It's a sign of what's going on a little bit too.
},
{
    196.52,197.36
     Right.
},
{
    197.36,198.44
     There's something in the joint itself
},
{
    198.44,200.16
     that's giving you trouble.
},
{
    200.16,202.56
     So, and I mentioned this is relatively easy
},
{
    202.56,203.76
     and to do this, we're gonna,
},
{
    203.76,205.72
     Liz volunteered to be our,
},
{
    205.72,206.56
     our,
},
{
    206.56,208.44
     I would say two of them are easy.
},
{
    208.44,210.8
     One of them is, you'd probably need a therapist.
},
{
    210.8,212.4
     Yeah, probably for the clinic.
},
{
    212.4,213.74
     But we'll show you a little bit of that.
},
{
    213.74,214.72
     Yeah, we'll show it to you anyway.
},
{
    214.72,215.56
     You bet.
},
{
    215.56,217.6
     We'll give you the whole smear.
},
{
    219.0,220.88
     All right, we're gonna switch places.
},
{
    221.96,225.0
     Okay, now I would expect you'll see the camera shaking
},
{
    225.8,227.6
     and everything else going on with Bob Bacter,
},
{
    227.6,228.64
     but just be patient.
},
{
    228.64,230.6
     Everything will work out.
},
{
    230.6,232.54
     A rookie, I already shook it.
},
{
    232.54,235.72
     Okay, now Liz isn't mic'd up, so she may talk,
},
{
    235.72,236.64
     but you may not hear it.
},
{
    236.64,238.0
     It's not that we don't want to hear it,
},
{
    238.0,240.8
     but for this purpose, this is okay.
},
{
    242.0,242.84
     Are you ready, Bob?
},
{
    242.84,244.0
     I'm ready, let's roll it.
},
{
    244.0,246.2
     Okay, so, you know, with the person laying down,
},
{
    246.2,247.96
     you could do it on the floor, it's kind of hard.
},
{
    247.96,250.92
     On a bed, it works as a best place, just like this.
},
{
    250.92,252.68
     Liz will be completely relaxed.
},
{
    252.68,254.64
     Her right hip is the one with pain.
},
{
    254.64,256.64
     When she walks on it, it goes up and down steps
},
{
    256.64,258.28
     usually because that's sharp pain.
},
{
    258.28,261.8
     Simply what you're gonna do is have the person relax
},
{
    261.8,264.6
     and grab the ankle and I'll just kind of wiggle the leg
},
{
    264.6,265.04
     a little bit
},
{
    265.04,267.32
     to make sure they're relaxed and not tense.
},
{
    267.32,271.0
     And then gently pull this direction
},
{
    271.0,272.8
     so we're putting traction on it.
},
{
    272.8,274.0
     So, and I'll do this and say,
},
{
    274.0,275.84
     how does that feel with a little pressure?
},
{
    275.84,277.12
     I mean, just a little bit.
},
{
    277.12,279.84
     And if the person says, oh, that feels kind of good,
},
{
    279.84,282.08
     then I'll pull a little bit more.
},
{
    282.08,283.78
     And if that feels better,
},
{
    283.78,286.86
     I'm never gonna get to the point where I'm pulling aggressively.
},
{
    287.98,288.82
     And I-
},
{
    288.82,290.52
     I wanna make sure that people know too,
},
{
    290.52,292.82
     you would never do this with a total hip replacement.
},
{
    292.82,293.66
     Right, right.
},
{
    293.66,296.56
     This is someone, you wouldn't have arthritis
},
{
    296.56,297.78
     on a total hip, so I, yeah,
},
{
    297.78,299.78
     if it was a total hip, it's time to go to the doctor.
},
{
    299.78,300.62
     Right, right.
},
{
    300.62,302.18
     And they get the orthopedic surgeon to look at it,
},
{
    302.18,303.98
     they'll probably take X-rays and whatnot.
},
{
    303.98,305.24
     So I'll do that.
},
{
    305.24,308.4
     Sometimes I'll pull on it, but it really won't respond well.
},
{
    308.4,311.92
     So then I'll take the toes or the leg
},
{
    311.92,314.72
     and internally rotate it slightly, just a little bit,
},
{
    314.72,317.96
     not gonna twist hard, just a little bit till it stops.
},
{
    317.96,321.02
     And then I'll pull again and see how it responds there.
},
{
    321.02,322.6
     And then I may go the other direction,
},
{
    322.6,325.44
     because sometimes one direction,
},
{
    325.44,328.08
     either inward or outward, can make a big difference
},
{
    328.08,329.56
     on the reduction in pain.
},
{
    329.56,334.2
     Yes, it can reproduce, oh no, take away the pain
},
{
    334.2,335.2
     is what I'm trying to say.
},
{
    335.2,336.36
     Abolish it, Bob.
},
{
    336.36,337.68
     Abolish it, how's that work?
},
{
    337.68,339.92
     And if none of those work, then I'll do this
},
{
    339.92,343.88
     and I'll abduct or go out to the side a little bit
},
{
    343.88,346.56
     and then I'll put a little traction on it
},
{
    346.56,350.68
     and also I can rotate outward or inward gently.
},
{
    350.68,352.44
     And oh, this is gentle.
},
{
    352.44,353.8
     You do not need to pull hard.
},
{
    353.8,356.0
     If it's gonna work, it's gonna work really well
},
{
    356.0,358.2
     and the person will say, oh, that feels good.
},
{
    358.2,360.52
     And then I've done it where I've just held people there
},
{
    360.52,363.0
     for 30 seconds until I get too tired
},
{
    363.0,365.88
     and then I'll relax and it can be real beneficial.
},
{
    365.88,368.64
     If that works and the person's time to go home
},
{
    368.64,370.64
     and they don't have anybody at home
},
{
    370.64,374.08
     that can reproduce the treatment,
},
{
    374.08,376.46
     I'll have the person, why don't you get up Liz.
},
{
    377.82,380.92
     If they have a stairway or a stool at home.
},
{
    382.6,385.8
     Now Liz, we're gonna say it's her left hip fur,
},
{
    385.8,387.08
     so you can see it, yep.
},
{
    387.08,390.04
     Liz, I want you to stand here with your sore leg.
},
{
    390.04,392.68
     You're gonna stand up on your step
},
{
    392.68,394.0
     and hold onto the braille,
},
{
    394.0,395.32
     or here we got the bouillou stick
},
{
    395.32,397.64
     just because it's here and it works well.
},
{
    397.64,400.36
     And really relax this leg, okay?
},
{
    400.36,402.44
     And once you get it to relax, that's the traction,
},
{
    402.44,404.56
     the weight of your leg is the traction, like me pulling.
},
{
    404.56,407.58
     And then you're gonna swing it forward and backwards gently.
},
{
    407.58,409.96
     This is like the pendulum exercise for the shoulders,
},
{
    409.96,411.34
     almost identical.
},
{
    411.34,415.62
     Now you can put an ankle weight on if it feels better.
},
{
    415.62,417.26
     And that's what Liz has in place right there.
},
{
    417.26,418.1
     That's what this orange is.
},
{
    418.1,420.18
     Now a lot of people don't have an ankle weight,
},
{
    420.18,422.64
     but if you happen to live in a northern climate like we do,
},
{
    422.64,425.36
     you can just put a pair of winter boots on.
},
{
    425.36,426.76
     They weigh about a pound or two.
},
{
    426.76,430.16
     Or steel toe boots if someone has some steel toe boots.
},
{
    430.16,431.52
     Anything gets away.
},
{
    431.52,433.56
     And the idea is to relax that leg
},
{
    433.56,435.64
     and just swing it forward and backwards.
},
{
    435.64,436.64
     There you go.
},
{
    436.64,437.88
     How does that feel Liz?
},
{
    437.88,439.16
     She says it's incredible.
},
{
    439.16,442.6
     So Liz could have Wesley hang on to the leg there.
},
{
    442.6,445.12
     So she's got a little three year old.
},
{
    445.12,446.92
     Oh yeah, yeah, that would be good.
},
{
    446.92,448.88
     You know how they hold onto your legs
},
{
    448.88,449.92
     when you try to walk?
},
{
    449.92,453.48
     Now, we did mention there was gonna be a third way,
},
{
    453.48,455.82
     but probably for the therapist to do.
},
{
    456.72,461.4
     And it works best on a plant that's the right height.
},
{
    461.4,463.68
     And if you have an adjustable one, it works better.
},
{
    463.68,465.4
     But we'll show you one of our tricks.
},
{
    465.4,467.24
     So why don't you bring that knee up.
},
{
    467.24,469.4
     And actually when I was in PT school,
},
{
    469.4,471.76
     this is one of the first treatments I did on a real patient.
},
{
    471.76,473.6
     She had severe arthritis in her hip.
},
{
    473.6,475.84
     She was young, she was like 40 years old.
},
{
    475.84,477.4
     Brad, you probably want to use a towel too.
},
{
    477.4,478.44
     Yeah, we've got it right here.
},
{
    478.44,479.28
     Don't worry, Bob.
},
{
    479.28,481.68
     All right, you had me worried there.
},
{
    481.68,485.92
     So he's putting the towel around his waist
},
{
    485.92,487.92
     and around Liz's thigh.
},
{
    487.92,491.72
     Okay, so Liz is gonna put the towel where it belongs.
},
{
    491.72,494.04
     So we got around her femur, okay?
},
{
    494.04,496.0
     And what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna hold her knee
},
{
    496.0,498.88
     and bring this up to 90 degrees and she's relaxed.
},
{
    498.88,500.64
     You feel comfortable?
},
{
    500.64,503.52
     This is kind of hard to see, but it's around my waist
},
{
    503.52,506.3
     and I'm gonna push outwards with my waist
},
{
    506.3,508.34
     while I stabilize her knee.
},
{
    508.34,510.9
     And that's gonna put traction instead of
},
{
    510.9,512.42
     in the sagittal plane,
},
{
    512.42,515.5
     it's gonna go in a lateral plane or abduct it.
},
{
    515.5,516.78
     And can you feel that lose?
},
{
    516.78,518.04
     Does that feel good?
},
{
    518.04,519.82
     Yeah, she thumbs up.
},
{
    519.82,521.98
     This does typically feel good,
},
{
    521.98,523.94
     whether you got a good hip or a bad hip,
},
{
    523.94,526.0
     because we're just gently stretching it.
},
{
    526.0,528.64
     And I'll stretch this way, and I'll may hold it
},
{
    528.64,530.12
     as long as it feels good.
},
{
    530.12,533.0
     If the person says, oh, that feels good, I'll hold it.
},
{
    533.0,535.96
     Usually as long as I can, which is 30 seconds a minute,
},
{
    535.96,538.08
     and I'll need a little break and move.
},
{
    538.08,540.8
     Sometimes I may go to this angle or straight,
},
{
    540.8,542.2
     and I'll work whichever works good.
},
{
    542.2,545.68
     Sometimes I'll move it gently if it feels good
},
{
    545.68,547.0
     so we get some motion.
},
{
    547.0,549.68
     Now we mentioned if there's a pinched tissue
},
{
    549.68,551.7
     or the capsule might be pinched in there,
},
{
    551.7,554.04
     if we can get it out of there and unpinched
},
{
    554.04,556.48
     and we can move it so it stays out,
},
{
    556.48,559.4
     then you're successful and you'll be able to walk around
},
{
    559.4,561.8
     and you'll, you know, as a therapist you feel like,
},
{
    561.8,562.92
     and the patient loves you
},
{
    562.92,565.92
     because he just cured their extremely sore hip.
},
{
    565.92,568.52
     So this doesn't work in all the hips, of course,
},
{
    568.52,570.68
     but it's easy to do, especially the traction
},
{
    570.68,574.72
     and the standing, and there's no negative effects to it.
},
{
    574.72,575.56
     So.
},
{
    575.56,577.36
     Yeah, I was actually able to do this to myself.
},
{
    577.36,580.04
     I took a belt and I put it around a stable object.
},
{
    580.04,581.68
     It was actually a weight bench.
},
{
    581.68,582.52
     Oh, really?
},
{
    582.52,585.6
     And then I just, I scooted myself away from it.
},
{
    585.6,586.44
     Oh okay.
},
{
    586.44,588.2
     And then, yeah, and it actually took away my hip pain.
},
{
    588.2,589.56
     I was having troubles in that.
},
{
    589.56,590.4
     Excellent.
},
{
    590.4,591.22
     Yeah, so.
},
{
    591.22,592.06
     I'd like to see a video of that.
},
{
    592.06,593.82
     Yeah, yeah, yeah.
},
{
    593.82,595.4
     Again, that's a lot more technical.
},
{
    595.4,598.56
     I wouldn't expect people to try that one.
},
{
    598.56,602.16
     I mean, you could mention it to a trainer or a therapist
},
{
    602.16,603.0
     and see if they could.
},
{
    603.0,603.84
     Right, so it's a little experience.
},
{
    603.84,604.68
     Right, right.
},
{
    604.68,608.92
     And then the enemy and working with people. So, I don't know Bob, if this has anything to do with,
},
{
    609.44,610.28
     you know.
},
{
    610.28,611.12
     We can fix just about anything.
},
{
    611.12,611.96
     Except for.
},
{
    611.96,612.8
     A broken heart.
},
{
    612.8,614.24
     What do you say Liz?
},
{
    614.24,616.0
     Yeah, she's showing the heart.
},
{
    616.0,None
     All right. you
},
