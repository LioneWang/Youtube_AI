     How to monitor oxygen levels and deliver oxygen therapy.
},
{
    10.92,15.54
     We're going to demonstrate how to check a patient's oxygen level using a pulse oximeter
},
{
    15.54,20.2
     and deliver oxygen therapy using an oxygen cylinder tank in nasal cannula.
},
{
    20.2,22.44
     Hi, what brings you in today?
},
{
    22.44,27.88
     So I've had a cough and my friend recently got tested positive for COVID-19.
},
{
    27.88,29.88
     Are you having any trouble breathing?
},
{
    29.88,30.88
     No.
},
{
    30.88,36.12
     I'm going to check your oxygen levels because some people that have COVID-19, even if they're
},
{
    36.12,39.64
     not having any trouble breathing, they can have low oxygen levels.
},
{
    39.64,40.84
     Okay.
},
{
    40.84,47.82
     Make sure to keep your pulse oximeter charged so it's ready to go. Turn on the pulse oximeter by pressing the power button.
},
{
    47.82,51.9
     Place the pulse oximeter so there's a snug fit on the finger.
},
{
    51.9,56.4
     The probe shouldn't be too tight, which may constrict the blood vessels,
},
{
    56.4,59.62
     or too loose, which may cause it to fall off or light in.
},
{
    59.62,63.08
     If the patient has henna, tattoos, nail polish,
},
{
    63.08,65.28
     or other dye on their finger, it may lead to
},
{
    65.28,70.96
     inaccurate results. You might have to switch the probe to a different finger, toe, or earlobe.
},
{
    71.76,77.84
     Many probes will beep when the reading is complete. The pulse oximeter shows that our patient has an
},
{
    77.84,87.0
     oxygen saturation of 85%. An oxygen saturation below 90%, even in a patient without symptoms, requires oxygen therapy.
},
{
    87.0,90.0
     Your oxygen levels are low.
},
{
    90.0,92.0
     So what does that mean?
},
{
    92.0,97.0
     Some people with COVID-19, even if they don't have trouble breathing, can have low oxygen levels.
},
{
    97.0,102.0
     I recommend we start oxygen therapy, so that way your brain and your heart can get the oxygen that you need.
},
{
    102.0,105.28
     Okay, if you think it'll help, but does it hurt?
},
{
    105.28,107.12
     Oh no, it's not going to hurt at all.
},
{
    107.12,108.12
     Okay.
},
{
    108.12,109.88
     You can just rest your hand right there.
},
{
    109.88,112.92
     First attach the regulator to the tank.
},
{
    112.92,119.64
     You don't have to screw it in too tightly, just enough so it's secure.
},
{
    119.64,124.04
     Slowly turn the valve counterclockwise to allow oxygen to flow.
},
{
    124.04,129.44
     Next, check the pressure gauge to make sure the needle is not in the red zone.
},
{
    129.44,133.98
     If it is in the red zone, that means there's not enough oxygen in the tank.
},
{
    133.98,140.28
     The flow meter can be started at a flow rate of 0.5 to 1 liter per minute for neonates,
},
{
    140.28,146.28
     1 to 2 liters per minute for infants and older children, up to a maximum of 4 liters per minute
},
{
    146.28,151.68
     for preschool and school-aged children, and up to a maximum of 5 liters per minute for adults.
},
{
    151.68,159.28
     Make sure that all the tubing is properly connected. If it's loose, tighten the connection. If you
},
{
    159.28,163.6
     aren't sure whether the equipment is working, place your hand in front of the nasal cannula to
},
{
    163.6,166.36
     feel if the oxygen is coming out.
},
{
    166.36,171.52
     Since the patient is an adult, you can start the oxygen at 5 liters per minute.
},
{
    171.52,176.08
     Oxygen should not be started in close proximity to flames or fire.
},
{
    176.08,180.26
     The nasal cannula prongs should be facing down as you place them.
},
{
    180.26,184.24
     For optimal results, make sure the person's nose is not blocked.
},
{
    184.24,187.04
     The tubing will go over the patient's ears to keep it in place.
},
{
    187.84,193.36
     After the oxygen has been flowing for 15 minutes, check the patient's oxygen levels again using
},
{
    193.36,199.2
     the pulse oximeter. Please note that with children, sometimes taping the tubing to the face with
},
{
    199.2,206.0
     medical tape can help to secure the nasal cannula. I'm going to check your oxygen levels again now that you have the oxygen flowing.
},
{
    206.0,207.0
     Okay.
},
{
    208.0,213.0
     In this case, the patient's oxygen levels have come up to 96%.
},
{
    213.0,216.0
     The goal saturation is above 90%.
},
{
    216.0,217.0
     The target has been reached.
},
{
    217.0,219.0
     Your oxygen is improving.
},
{
    219.0,220.0
     That's great.
},
{
    221.0,225.0
     The patient may need continued oxygen therapy for multiple days or weeks.
},
{
    225.0,229.0
     Options may include having them stay at the clinic if there is capacity
},
{
    229.0,233.0
     or transferring them to another facility or hospital for continued oxygen therapy.
},
{
    233.0,238.0
     There, providers can continue to monitor the patient's oxygen levels
},
{
    238.0,242.0
     and wean the patient off of the oxygen therapy once they no longer require it.
},
{
    242.0,245.24
     Now that the patient's oxygen saturation
},
{
    245.24,247.32
     is remaining above 90%,
},
{
    247.32,250.76
     the patient can be reassessed every four to six hours,
},
{
    250.76,254.36
     or at least once a day, to try decreasing the oxygen.
},
{
    254.36,256.04
     If the patient's oxygen levels
},
{
    256.04,259.3
     do not remain above 90% with the oxygen therapy,
},
{
    259.3,262.12
     do not go above two liters per minute for children
},
{
    262.12,264.16
     or above five liters per minute for adults
},
{
    264.16,266.04
     using the nasal cannula.
},
{
    266.04,268.22
     More intensive care is needed.
},
{
    268.22,272.58
     When you are finished using the pulse oximeter, clean it gently with a disinfectant cloth
},
{
    272.58,274.22
     or alcohol swab.
},
{
    274.22,276.34
     Dispose of the nasal cannula.
},
{
    276.34,280.78
     The equipment is safe to use in children, adults, and pregnant women and can deliver
},
{
    280.78,283.62
     life-saving therapy to people who need it.
