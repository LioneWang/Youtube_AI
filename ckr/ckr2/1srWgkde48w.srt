     Hi, today I'm going to talk about numb and tingling feet that occur during exercise.
},
{
    5.6,9.72
     So what we're talking about is often numbness that occurs under the ball of the foot and
},
{
    9.72,14.8
     up into the toes, while bicycling often happens on an elliptical machine, less commonly it
},
{
    14.8,18.0
     happens during running and walking type of activities.
},
{
    18.0,22.04
     So what is happening here is conditioned called compressive neuropathy.
},
{
    22.04,27.48
     This is actually, if you look at this foot, we're looking at the nerves on top of the foot here.
},
{
    27.48,29.12
     There's actually a similar set of nerves
},
{
    29.12,30.4
     right on the bottom of the foot.
},
{
    30.4,32.92
     And if there's excessive pressure on these nerves,
},
{
    32.92,35.6
     that can cause numbness and cause pressure
},
{
    35.6,37.28
     to those nerves, damage to the nerves,
},
{
    37.28,41.08
     and the numbness from that point of irritation forward.
},
{
    41.08,44.48
     So the nice thing is this is usually pretty easy to treat.
},
{
    44.48,48.44
     The first thing we wanna do is take the pressure off of this area. I think the first
},
{
    48.44,51.8
     critical thing to say about this is make sure your shoes fit and make sure
},
{
    51.8,55.32
     there's plenty of room for you, especially on bike shoes which tend to run
},
{
    55.32,60.04
     kind of narrow. You want to make sure there's no compression this way. So always
},
{
    60.04,64.04
     buy your bike shoes at the end of the day. It's actually best to go for a long
},
{
    64.04,65.12
     bike ride and then go bike shoes. The kind of the day. It's actually best to go for a long bike ride and then
},
{
    65.12,69.52
     go bike shoes. The guy in the shoe store may not like you so much, but you'll get a better fitting
},
{
    69.52,75.04
     shoe. The other option is to try on the shoes with two pair of socks. That way if you start,
},
{
    75.04,79.36
     you can actually start your ride wearing two pairs of socks and then halfway through the ride,
},
{
    79.36,83.84
     if your feet start to get numb, you can take off one pair as your feet start to swell. So it takes
},
{
    83.84,89.52
     care of the swelling issue. Second thing we want to do is transfer pressure off of this area. Some simple
},
{
    89.52,94.96
     ways to do that, both that you can try yourself and that's not enough. You can come in and see us
},
{
    94.96,99.68
     and we can do a better job at it usually. First thing is to use an arch support in your athletic
},
{
    99.68,104.0
     shoes, whether they be bicycle shoes again or your running shoes you might use on an elliptical
},
{
    104.0,108.4
     machine. The idea is that you want an orthotic that grabs the arch
},
{
    108.4,112.08
     extremely tight because we're trying to transfer pressure off of this area and
},
{
    112.08,115.36
     get it onto the ball of the foot. That's what takes pressure off of these
},
{
    115.36,120.0
     nerves. So this is one of my favorite arch supports you can buy over the counter.

     can find a list of everything we recommend for this problem.
},
{
    132.12,137.4
     You can even get some sandals, the Vionic sandals that I often recommend that have some
},
{
    137.4,139.08
     good arch support in them.
},
{
    139.08,141.52
     You can wear those around the house, take pressure off the area.
},
{
    141.52,145.76
     But again, the key is to have that arch support in your athletic shoes.
},
{
    145.76,149.76
     If the over the counter supports are not enough then you can use a custom orthotic.
},
{
    149.76,154.32
     The advantage of the custom orthotics is they will conform much, much tighter to the arch of the
},
{
    154.32,159.84
     foot. In fact they should be airtight to the arch of the foot in order to transfer pressure from
},
{
    159.84,164.96
     here back to here. Now this is one we might use an athletic shoe or a running shoe. The ones for
},
{
    164.96,167.96
     bicycle shoes tend to be somewhat smaller since there's not as
},
{
    167.96,172.32
     much volume in those shoes. The key here is do not live with this problem. It's an
},
{
    172.32,176.88
     easy one to treat in most cases. If you're in our area make an appointment.
},
{
    176.88,180.64
     Make sure that when you come in to bring your cycling shoes or bring whatever
},
{
    180.64,184.48
     shoes that you're having trouble with, bring any arch supports or orthotics you
},
{
    184.48,185.64
     currently are using.
},
{
    185.64,189.08
     We'll take a look at everything, give you ideas on what you can do to get rid of this
},
{
    189.08,190.08
     problem.
