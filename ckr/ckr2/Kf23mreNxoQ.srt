     changes as you recover.
},
{
    29.0,35.0
     A stroke can affect the muscles in the lips, tongue, and throat that we use to eat and swallow.
},
{
    35.0,43.0
     When these muscles are weak or uncoordinated, changes can occur in your ability to safely eat and drink.
},
{
    44.8,48.28
     occur in your ability to safely eat and drink. Swallowing difficulty is called dysphagia.
},
{
    48.28,50.88
     Dysphagia may cause food or drink
},
{
    50.88,54.12
     to go down your airway instead of the tube to the stomach
},
{
    54.12,56.08
     and may cause problems like pneumonia.
},
{
    59.24,62.6
     With dysphagia, you may also have difficulties chewing
},
{
    62.6,66.4
     or clearing food from the throat or mouth, especially on the weaker side.
},
{
    69.4,76.4
     Coughing, choking, throat clearing, or a sensation of food sticking in your throat may occur.
},
{
    77.36,84.16
     If it is not safe to eat or drink by mouth, you may be fed through a tube until it is safe again to swallow.
},
{
    86.72,90.88
     So what can be done to make swallowing safer?
},
{
    90.88,94.96
     Food can be chopped or pureed.
},
{
    94.96,100.16
     Liquids can be thickened to allow more time to swallow.
},
{
    100.16,105.68
     You and those helping you can learn how to prepare foods and drinks into safer textures.
},
{
    107.68,113.68
     Swallowing exercises may also be recommended to help strengthen your ability to swallow.
},
{
    114.96,119.92
     At Mealtimes, shut off the TV or radio to focus on your meal.
},
{
    121.6,129.92
     Sit upright when eating and drinking and for at least 20 to 30 minutes afterwards.
},
{
    129.92,135.16
     Eat and drink slowly and take small bites and sips.
},
{
    135.16,140.12
     Swallow all the food in your mouth before taking another bite.
},
{
    140.12,145.04
     Use your tongue to clear out food on the weaker side of your mouth.
},
{
    145.04,149.24
     If you are helping at meals, sit at eye level.
},
{
    149.24,155.06
     Place the food close by to encourage the person to feed themselves if possible.
},
{
    155.06,161.44
     If someone is too tired or not alert, it is better to wait and eat later.
},
{
    161.44,166.0
     Medications can make you less alert or lead to a dry mouth, making swallowing more difficult.
},
{
    166.0,171.0
     Talk to your doctor if you think medications may be affecting your swallowing.
},
{
    171.0,176.0
     Be sure to brush your teeth, gums, and tongue, especially after meals.
},
{
    176.0,181.0
     A clean mouth can help prevent lung infections if you have swallowing problems.
},
{
    190.92,196.68
     Changes to communication can also happen after a stroke. You may have difficulties speaking clearly, saying what you want to say, or understanding
},
{
    196.68,202.08
     what others are saying. You may also have challenges with reading and writing.
},
{
    202.08,205.74
     A stroke can change the strength and coordination of
},
{
    205.74,213.02
     our face, lips and tongue. This can make your speech sound slurred, weak or too
},
{
    213.02,221.74
     slow. This is called dysarthria. You may have difficulties planning the movements
},
{
    221.74,225.32
     needed for speech. Talking may have many
},
{
    225.32,232.04
     stops and starts and in some cases no sounds come out. This is called a praxea
},
{
    232.04,238.56
     of speech. A stroke can also affect the areas of the brain that control language.
},
{
    238.56,251.0
     This is called a phasia. With a phasia you may have difficulty finding words or making sentences, reading and writing,
},
{
    251.0,254.4
     or understanding what you hear.
},
{
    254.4,261.48
     Aphasia means that you have difficulty with language, not with thinking or decision making.
},
{
    261.48,267.0
     Changes to communication can be frustrating, as day-to-day conversation may now be difficult.
},
{
    267.0,274.0
     Often, you know what you want to say. You're just having difficulty getting the message out.
},
{
    274.0,281.0
     There are many things that you, your caregiver, and friends can do to make communication easier.
},
{
    281.0,288.8
     Give yourself time to communicate. Try other ways of getting your message out, such as writing,
},
{
    288.8,296.16
     drawing, pointing, gesturing, or using a communication board. Use another word to
},
{
    296.16,311.6
     say it in a different way. If you are a friend, family, or caregiver, and want to help someone to understand what is being said. Use simple language and speak slowly. Repeat what you are saying. Use
},
{
    311.6,319.5
     gestures, objects, draw pictures, or write out keywords. Clarify when you're
},
{
    319.5,326.66
     starting a new topic and be sure to check back that the person has understood. If you are not
},
{
    326.66,333.06
     sure what the person is trying to say, ask simple questions that involve a yes or no
},
{
    333.06,347.92
     answer or give a few choices. Tell them what you did understand. It's okay to try again later, they will appreciate the effort.
},
{
    347.92,351.76
     A stroke can also affect your ability to focus.
},
{
    351.76,357.72
     Think clearly, learn tasks, and remember new information.
},
{
    357.72,370.4
     These changes to thinking skills can affect your ability to have a conversation. Therapy can help you find ways to manage these changes and stay engaged.
},
{
    370.4,375.4
     Some find it helpful to join community groups or programs to practice
},
{
    375.4,379.4
     communication with other stroke survivors.
},
{
    379.4,384.4
     Understanding how a stroke can affect communication is important in helping to
},
{
    384.4,385.12
     reconnect with
},
{
    385.12,388.32
     loved ones and friends.
