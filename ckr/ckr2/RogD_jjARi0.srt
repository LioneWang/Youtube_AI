     Arash from the Prehab Guys here, Doctor of Physical Therapy.
},
{
    5.68,9.04
     We're going to be talking about shoulder pain and the bench press.
},
{
    9.04,13.0
     This is a common question that we get and we're going to take you guys through a three-step
},
{
    13.0,17.0
     procedure to make sure that you can bench press pain-free again.
},
{
    17.0,19.84
     So step number one, Craig, let's have you.
},
{
    19.84,24.28
     Craig, by the way, here is the number one bench presser here in California.
},
{
    24.28,29.66
     So we're going to have Craig do is have you bench press. Let's go. Let's go down. So Craig's
},
{
    29.66,32.92
     laying down. First thing he's gonna do is tuck his feet in. Make sure that his
},
{
    32.92,37.16
     pelvis stays stable. And then from here his the bar should be at about eye height.
},
{
    37.16,41.68
     So Craig should scoot down a tiny bit so you can see here that the bar is about
},
{
    41.68,45.16
     at eye height for him. Now, in terms of the hand placement,
},
{
    45.16,47.6
     let's have Craig bring his arms out to his side
},
{
    47.6,49.12
     where his fingertips are,
},
{
    49.12,51.16
     should be about the width of his hand here.
},
{
    51.16,55.0
     So let's go straight up and now grab onto the barbell.
},
{
    55.0,57.08
     Now this is Craig's starting position.
},
{
    57.08,59.84
     Craig, let's have you lift the weight up.
},
{
    59.84,60.84
     There you go.
},
{
    60.84,63.2
     And so now what Craig's gonna focus on
},
{
    63.2,65.68
     is bringing the fingertips in together.
},
{
    65.68,67.14
     This is called bending the bar.
},
{
    67.14,70.0
     This is going to make sure his scapula stays strong.
},
{
    70.0,74.28
     Also think about retracting the shoulder blades, pulling back the shoulder blades.
},
{
    74.28,78.48
     Now off a strong staple of scapula, that shoulder blade in the back there, Craig is
},
{
    78.48,82.98
     going to go down and bench press, go down nice and controlled and then push up.
},
{
    82.98,85.04
     So what Craig's going to focus on at the bottom
},
{
    85.04,91.52
     position here is that the bar should be just below nipple height. So we can see here that when the
},
{
    91.52,96.8
     bar comes down, Craig is going just below nipple height for females out there. It's about your
},
{
    96.8,101.84
     bra line. And then Craig's pushing back up. This is going to make sure that he gets good activation
},
{
    101.84,105.1
     from his pec and triceps and then push up.
},
{
    105.1,108.78
     So the next step that we're going to go to is modifying the movement.
},
{
    108.78,111.7
     So there's a couple of different things that we can do to modify the movement.
},
{
    111.7,116.1
     We know that we can either stress the shoulder by using the pec or we can stress the elbow
},
{
    116.1,117.72
     by using the triceps.
},
{
    117.72,121.06
     So we want Craig to take some stress off of the shoulder.
},
{
    121.06,123.54
     We're going to bias the triceps a little bit more.
},
{
    123.54,125.88
     How we're going to do that, narrow the grip.
},
{
    125.88,131.68
     So we can see here, Craig now is narrowing his hand placement to about shoulder width.
},
{
    131.68,134.42
     Now Craig, let's lift the weight up.
},
{
    134.42,135.92
     Light weight for Craig here.
},
{
    135.92,137.48
     And then let's go down.
},
{
    137.48,141.12
     And you can see here that the moment arm to his shoulder is less.
},
{
    141.12,143.7
     His elbow is coming closer to his torso.
},
{
    143.7,149.68
     So his body, his elbow itself is closer to his body. It's not flared out. The elbows are tight and
},
{
    149.68,153.1
     Craig does that pretty well. You're gonna feel more of the triceps with this
},
{
    153.1,157.26
     than the pec. That's because we're loading those muscles more, taking some
},
{
    157.26,161.74
     stress off of the shoulder. What we can also do if the regular bench press
},
{
    161.74,166.96
     bothers you Craig, is just modify the movement by going through a little bit less range of motion.
},
{
    166.96,169.12
     So we can put something on Craig's chest here.
},
{
    169.12,172.36
     This is going to make sure Craig doesn't go all the way down.
},
{
    172.36,173.72
     We'll go through the regular bench press.
},
{
    173.72,175.84
     So shoulders out, hands straight.
},
{
    175.84,176.84
     Yep.
},
{
    176.84,177.84
     Find that width.
},
{
    177.84,182.0
     And now when Craig does the bench press, he's going to go through the exact same motion
},
{
    182.0,187.28
     that he normally would shooting for just below nipple line, but now he's going through less range of motion.
},
{
    187.28,191.26
     What happens at the bottom position of the bench press is that people get this anterior
},
{
    191.26,194.0
     translation and stress the front of the shoulder.
},
{
    194.0,196.8
     And that's what creates a lot of people's discomfort when they bench press.
},
{
    196.8,200.24
     So what we do here, modify the range of motion that someone goes through.
},
{
    200.24,205.04
     And then if these two things help, what I would challenge you to do is slowly actually
},
{
    205.04,209.78
     dose back in the range of motion and bringing the elbows out to your side or out a little
},
{
    209.78,212.84
     bit more as you feel more and more comfortable.
},
{
    212.84,214.8
     Step three is making sure you warm up.
},
{
    214.8,218.68
     A lot of people warm up by just going light, but we're actually going to go through our
},
{
    218.68,223.1
     two very easy exercises that you can perform anywhere.
},
{
    223.1,225.52
     Let's do a banded pull apart here. So number
},
{
    225.52,229.8
     one is a banded pull apart where Craig has a light band making sure that he can pull the
},
{
    229.8,234.08
     band apart by squeezing the shoulder blades. So let's go for 10 reps and we can see that
},
{
    234.08,238.4
     Craig gets great activation in the shoulder blades. Remember how when we bench press we're
},
{
    238.4,243.16
     staying strong back there because the shoulders move on the shoulder blade. We want to make
},
{
    243.16,245.6
     sure the shoulder blades stays strong and active.
},
{
    245.6,248.32
     So we're going to go 10 reps here.
},
{
    248.32,251.68
     Again, lightweight. You don't have to go too crazy with this.
},
{
    251.68,254.32
     Exercise two will be shoulder taps.
},
{
    254.32,257.28
     Let's get on the floor, Craig.
},
{
    257.28,258.96
     Making you work.
},
{
    258.96,259.84
     I got a little pump.
},
{
    259.84,260.88
     A little pump.
},
{
    260.88,263.6
     All right, so scapula engaged.
},
{
    263.6,265.28
     His shoulder blades are pushed out.
},
{
    265.4,269.52
     And now he's slowly tapping one shoulder and then tapping the opposite.
},
{
    269.8,272.52
     You can see how he's not rotating a lot with this exercise.
},
{
    272.76,275.84
     He's keeping the body straight. If I had a glass of water right here,
},
{
    275.96,278.88
     it's not spilling because Craig's moving with control. If you're
},
{
    280.28,283.44
     debatable, if, if Craig was moving all over the place,
},
{
    283.44,285.98
     this is not controlled and we want to actually modify
},
{
    285.98,289.04
     that making sure that he can control this a little bit better.
},
{
    289.04,290.04
     This is looking perfect.
},
{
    290.04,292.08
     We're shooting for 10 reps here.
},
{
    292.08,297.6
     He would go back and forth with each exercise for three sets, 10 reps of each.
},
{
    297.6,302.22
     And that itself would be a great warm up just to go into a prior to going into a bench
},
{
    302.22,303.22
     press.
},
{
    303.22,305.2
     So Craig's doing an awesome job here
},
{
    306.6,308.44
     and he can stop at 10,
},
{
    308.44,311.4
     but again, just recapping for all you guys out there,
},
{
    311.4,312.24
     that's good Craig.
},
{
    313.2,315.24
     Recapping for all you guys out there,
},
{
    315.24,317.2
     three easy steps that you can do
},
{
    317.2,319.24
     for bench pressing pain free again.
},
{
    319.24,322.12
     Step number one is making sure that you have good form.
},
{
    322.12,323.68
     Pull the shoulder blades back,
},
{
    323.68,328.92
     make sure that you tighten the grip by pulling the fingertips together.
},
{
    328.92,331.76
     Step number two is modifying the movement itself.
},
{
    331.76,335.4
     This is by decreasing the range of motion or by going a little more narrow to making
},
{
    335.4,338.4
     sure that you get more triceps and less pattern.
},
{
    338.4,342.8
     Step three is just making sure that you get a good warm-up going.
},
{
    342.8,346.76
     Not just going lighter on the bench press but actually warming up the muscles that we want
},
{
    346.76,349.44
     to appropriately perform the bench press pain-free.
},
{
    349.44,352.96
