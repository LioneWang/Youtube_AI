     Hi, I'm Martha Murray and I'm one of the orthopedic surgeons here at Children's Hospital Boston.
},
{
    4.52,7.36
     This is Elizabeth Beck, one of our physician's assistants, and we're going to go through
},
{
    7.36,11.02
     with you today how to adjust your post-operative brace.
},
{
    11.02,13.36
     The brace we're going to show you today is made by Bragg.
},
{
    13.36,15.08
     It's called the T-scope brace.
},
{
    15.08,19.08
     It has two hinges, one on either side, and it's held together with four straps.
},
{
    19.08,22.36
     And we're going to show you a little bit about how to put it together.
},
{
    22.36,27.32
     Most of this work we will have done for you in the operating room so you'll wake up with the brace adjusted but sometimes when
},
{
    27.32,31.24
     you get home you'll need to do some of these adjustments as well. We'll show you those specific
},
{
    31.24,34.8
     adjustments you'll likely need to do at home. But what we do in the operating room while
},
{
    34.8,38.84
     you're still asleep is we're going to adjust first the hinges to the right length. For
},
{
    38.84,43.32
     most people it means setting the bar at about the number one and then we can clip down these
},
{
    43.32,47.16
     clips to make sure that it's secure in place.
},
{
    47.16,51.12
     If you find that your brace is sliding like this, up and down, check to see if the clip
},
{
    51.12,53.4
     has come unhooked.
},
{
    53.4,56.6
     So you can just click it down like that and secure it again in place.
},
{
    56.6,59.72
     And again, we are going to do all four of these at the number one position.
},
{
    59.72,63.96
     So let's do the other side too.
},
{
    63.96,67.2
     This makes sure that the two hinges are the same length and the length that you need for
},
{
    67.2,69.36
     your surgery protection.
},
{
    69.36,72.4
     The next thing we're going to do is we're going to set the range of motion of the brace.
},
{
    72.4,76.96
     So the brace as it comes can have a very wide range of motion.
},
{
    76.96,81.16
     For most of our patients, initially we're going to limit your motion to about 90 degrees
},
{
    81.16,82.92
     of bending or flexion.
},
{
    82.92,85.9
     So in order to do that, we're going to take these little triangular tabs
},
{
    85.9,87.64
     and pull it out to release it.
},
{
    87.64,90.52
     And then we can slide it over to the number 90 and stick it right back in at
},
{
    90.52,91.72
     the number 90.
},
{
    91.72,95.66
     And that lets us then adjust the brace so now it can only go from 0
},
{
    95.66,99.56
     to 90 degrees. Can't go all the way so that helps to protect your knee.
},
{
    99.56,103.68
     The other thing you're going to be asked to do is to lock your brace at times.
},
{
    103.68,107.0
     So this device here is what locks the brace.
},
{
    107.0,111.0
     Right now the brace is unlocked, but if I slide that down, now the brace is locked, it
},
{
    111.0,112.0
     can't move.
},
{
    112.0,116.48
     We'll often ask you to lock it at zero degrees for sleeping at night for the first several
},
{
    116.48,117.92
     weeks after surgery.
},
{
    117.92,121.56
     You can see here how the number zero is lined up with the line on the brace.
},
{
    121.56,123.88
     That means it's locked at zero degrees.
},
{
    123.88,128.14
     If you're locking the brace, you want to lock it on both hinges.
},
{
    128.14,129.52
     So we're going to lock this one as well.
},
{
    129.52,130.88
     So now it's locked.
},
{
    130.88,133.2
     Now I'm going to fit the brace on Elizabeth's leg.
},
{
    133.2,136.4
     So we're going to unlock it to do that.
},
{
    136.4,139.76
     So we've got to unlock both hinges so that now the brace can move.
},
{
    139.76,142.04
     Did we set this one at 90 degrees?
},
{
    142.04,145.68
     Let's set this one at 90 degrees as well so the two hinges match.
},
{
    145.68,146.68
     So we're just pulling that out.
},
{
    146.68,149.84
     We're going to put that in there so we've got that hinged.
},
{
    149.84,151.76
     Now we've got 90 degrees on both hinges.
},
{
    151.76,153.4
     So can you lift your leg up for me?
},
{
    153.4,155.08
     So we're going to put the brace on.
},
{
    155.08,159.88
     We're going to slide it so the four straps are under Elizabeth's leg there.
},
{
    159.88,163.24
     And then we're going to ask her to Elizabeth, can you bend your knee up a little bit so
},
{
    163.24,167.24
     that we can make sure the hinges are matching where her knee motion is?
},
{
    167.24,170.88
     Typically that means that the top of the hinge is about at the top of your knee cap, but
},
{
    170.88,174.16
     sometimes it's easiest just to put the brace on with the pillow under your knee so you
},
{
    174.16,176.08
     make sure you get the bend in the right place.
},
{
    176.08,179.04
     Okay, you put your leg down, straight, good.
},
{
    179.04,182.24
     So now you can see that the brace is clearly too big for Elizabeth's leg, so we're going
},
{
    182.24,185.44
     to adjust it to her leg by adjusting the straps.
},
{
    185.44,187.5
     And typically what I'll do is I'll just hook
},
{
    187.5,190.04
     one of these front straps just to kind of hold it in place,
},
{
    190.04,191.34
     maybe two of them.
},
{
    191.34,194.38
     But you can, and what I wanna do is adjust the hinges
},
{
    194.38,197.78
     so that the hinges are perpendicular to the table
},
{
    197.78,199.18
     but parallel to each other.
},
{
    199.18,201.38
     So you don't want the hinges coming in like this
},
{
    201.38,203.56
     towards each other around the back of the leg.
},
{
    203.56,207.08
     You want them on the side of the leg and parallel to each other.
},
{
    207.08,211.0
     The other thing that when you fit the brace is that you'll notice that sometimes there'll
},
{
    211.0,215.84
     be space between the hinge and your knee on one side or the other that's totally normal
},
{
    215.84,218.96
     and fine and not a problem with the brace.
},
{
    218.96,222.4
     The key thing is to make the hinges parallel to each other.
},
{
    222.4,225.44
     So now we've got the brace just kind of provisionally on.
},
{
    225.44,227.24
     We've got the hinges where we want them.
},
{
    227.24,230.08
     But if Elizabeth lifts up her leg, do you mind lifting it up?
},
{
    230.08,231.84
     You can see how there's a lot of slack here
},
{
    231.84,233.12
     in the straps underneath.
},
{
    233.12,234.36
     So the first thing we're going to do,
},
{
    234.36,236.0
     you can put it down, thank you, is we're
},
{
    236.0,237.92
     going to tighten up those straps underneath.
},
{
    237.92,242.0
     And in order to do that, there are these holders on the side,
},
{
    242.0,244.88
     velcro holders, and we can flip out these tabs.
},
{
    244.88,248.44
     And the tabs will let us then pull the back through.
},
{
    248.44,250.0
     So why don't you lift up again just for a minute.
},
{
    250.0,253.28
     So now I've released the tab here, and I can pull this through.
},
{
    253.28,254.88
     Do you see how it's tightening up back there?
},
{
    254.88,256.72
     But I want to make sure I don't tighten it up too much.
},
{
    256.72,259.4
     I don't want to bring this hinge around the back.
},
{
    259.4,262.76
     So I just tighten it up, and I'm going to tighten up the other straps just to get the
},
{
    262.76,263.76
     slack out of them.
},
{
    263.76,267.0
     We'll do the final adjustments later, and so we're going to do that on all four of these
},
{
    267.0,271.88
     here.
},
{
    271.88,275.24
     And then I put the tab back to kind of anchor that strap in the back, okay, and come on
},
{
    275.24,276.96
     back down.
},
{
    276.96,280.32
     And now what we're going to do is we're going to tighten up in the front.
},
{
    280.32,284.36
     You can do that simply by releasing the Velcro tab here on the front and then pulling through
},
{
    284.36,286.78
     the hinge like this.
},
{
    286.78,290.32
     And then you can fasten that back on.
},
{
    290.32,293.98
     So we're going to hook this on, take this and now we can just pull this through the
},
{
    293.98,299.74
     hinge like that and back around on the back.
},
{
    299.74,303.1
     Is this bothering you anywhere?
},
{
    303.1,307.0
     Is it okay?
},
{
    307.6,311.04
     Now one thing, sometimes on these upper straps or even on the lower straps,
},
{
    311.04,315.28
     you'll find that the Velcro tab is going to hit plastic
},
{
    315.28,318.8
     and so you can't make it hook or it's hooking way around the back of your leg
},
{
    318.8,320.24
     and it's inconvenient.
},
{
    320.24,325.0
     These tabs actually can come off the end of the strap.
},
{
    325.0,328.0
     And then you can fold the strap, or if you need to, you can trim it.
},
{
    328.0,332.0
     And then you can put this tab right back on the end of the strap that you folded over.
},
{
    332.0,336.0
     And so it now attaches to something that's sticky for the Velcro.
},
{
    336.0,339.0
     So that's another trick that you can use to adjust it.
},
{
    339.0,345.52
     So most of this will have been done for you in the operating room at the time of your surgery.
},
{
    345.52,348.32
     The other thing that will happen in the operating room though is oftentimes you'll have an ice
},
{
    348.32,351.04
     pack placed underneath your brace.
},
{
    351.04,354.14
     In that case, after a day or two of using that ice pack, you may want to take the ice
},
{
    354.14,356.4
     pack out and get around.
},
{
    356.4,359.6
     When that happens, these straps will often be a little bit loose because they will have
},
{
    359.6,362.16
     been sized to have the ice pack under there.
},
{
    362.16,365.72
     If that's the case, then you're going to want to tighten up particularly these two straps
},
{
    365.72,367.68
     once you take the ice pack out.
},
{
    367.68,373.32
     So in order to do that, the first thing you're going to do is release the two straps, and
},
{
    373.32,374.64
     then you're going to check the back.
},
{
    374.64,378.56
     So if Elizabeth has, you can see how she has some slack still here in the back, because
},
{
    378.56,380.16
     we've taken the ice pack out.
},
{
    380.16,384.36
     So again, same thing that we did earlier, you're going to release this tab right here,
},
{
    384.36,386.44
     and then gently pull the strap through in the back
},
{
    386.44,389.16
     so that you get a nice fit there on the back of your calf.
},
{
    389.16,391.28
     And then you can tighten the front down.
},
{
    391.28,391.88
     Same thing here.
},
{
    391.88,394.2
     We're going to release the back tab first
},
{
    394.2,396.6
     so we can pull that through, anchor that,
},
{
    396.6,399.08
     then we can pull the front tab through.
},
{
    399.08,401.0
     Do you want to just try bending your knee up
},
{
    401.0,402.2
     and making sure it feels like it's
},
{
    402.2,406.88
     hinging in the right place so that feel pretty comfortable? And that's how you put on the brace and adjust it.
},
