     Hey everyone, it's Sarah the Register Nurse, arian.com.
},
{
    2.4,7.04
     And in this video, I'm going to give you some tips on how to count a respiratory rate.
},
{
    7.04,11.56
     So counting a respiratory rate seems like a pretty simple skill, but it can be tricky,
},
{
    11.56,14.68
     especially if you're first starting out and you're trying to collect all those other
},
{
    14.68,17.32
     vital signs on top of your respiratory rate.
},
{
    17.32,22.52
     Plus, some patients, it's easy to count the respiratory rate, while in others, it's not.
},
{
    22.52,25.76
     First let's quickly review how to count a respiratory rate.
},
{
    25.76,32.16
     So a normal respiratory rate in an adult is about 12 to 20 breaths per minute. But not only are we
},
{
    32.16,37.2
     counting that rate, we're looking to see if the breathing is labored or unlabored. An example of
},
{
    37.2,45.4
     labored breathing would be like this. And notice how the patient's chest, we can really see it moving up and down.
},
{
    45.4,48.8
     They're using their mouth to breathe in and breathe out.
},
{
    48.8,53.88
     Also we're looking at if the breathing is irregular or regular.
},
{
    53.88,58.08
     So irregular breathing would be patients taking a breath here and there.
},
{
    58.08,60.4
     It's not on this consistent rate.
},
{
    60.4,64.24
     They may like take a breath in and out, in and out, and then there's a pause and then
},
{
    64.24,66.32
     they'll breathe again here and there a
},
{
    66.84,73.46
     Regular rate would be there's a consistent rhythm to that breathing now if the rate is regular
},
{
    73.46,77.08
     You'll want to count for 30 seconds and multiply by two
},
{
    77.36,82.4
     However, if the rate is irregular you'll want to count for one complete minute
},
{
    82.44,85.04
     So when you go to count the respiratory rate, you want to
},
{
    85.04,91.04
     make sure that you are doing it manually rather than going by the number that's on the monitor.
},
{
    91.04,96.16
     Because as a nurse, I have found that that number that that monitor gives you is usually not the
},
{
    96.16,101.36
     rate that your patient is breathing. So always double check that. Now, whenever you do go to
},
{
    101.36,108.6
     count the respiratory rate, you want to make sure that the patient isn't really aware at that time that you're counting the respiratory rate because they
},
{
    108.6,111.2
     will alter the way that they're breathing.
},
{
    111.2,114.56
     It's just like if I told you I'm going to count how many times you blink.
},
{
    114.56,117.4
     You are going to alter how much you are blinking.
},
{
    117.4,119.0
     You will change it.
},
{
    119.0,124.04
     So whenever you do this skill, you want to combine it with checking the pulse rate.
},
{
    124.04,125.36
     So you'll fill on the side, the radial side checking the pulse rate. So you'll fill on
},
{
    125.36,129.76
     the side, the radial side, the pulse rate, count that like you normally would. But then
},
{
    129.76,133.6
     you're going to keep your finger on that side and count the respiratory rate. But the patient
},
{
    133.6,139.04
     thinks that you're counting their pulse rate still. And what you're looking for is the rise
},
{
    139.04,147.12
     and the fall of the chest. One rise and one fall of the chest equals one breath. But this is where the tricky
},
{
    147.12,152.72
     part comes into play because it's like how do I determine what's a rise and what's a fall of the
},
{
    152.72,158.24
     chest so I can count one breath. And here are some tips to help you do that. Now with these tips,
},
{
    158.24,162.8
     you're going to find in practice that some of these tips work great on some patients while
},
{
    162.8,167.76
     others you may have to change it up a bit because every patient is built differently.
},
{
    167.76,171.4
     They're going to be wearing different clothes like some patients are going to wear gowns.
},
{
    171.4,175.4
     Some may not even have a gown on and some may be wearing their regular street clothes.
},
{
    175.4,179.64
     And a lot of patients they have different disease processes going on.
},
{
    179.64,183.88
     So one thing I like to do if I know this patient it's going to be hard to count their
},
{
    183.88,184.88
     respiratory rate.
},
{
    184.88,185.64
     I'm going to get down at the to be hard to count their respiratory rate.
},
{
    185.64,189.52
     I'm going to get down at the level of their chest, like their shoulder and chest area,
},
{
    189.52,191.44
     and their abdominal level.
},
{
    191.44,195.12
     Because I'm looking at that rise and that fall of that chest.
},
{
    195.12,198.92
     I'm getting down here looking at that while I'm checking that pulse rate.
},
{
    198.92,201.8
     So I start out in that position.
},
{
    201.8,205.92
     And some patients, it's really easy to tell depending on how they breathe. Like the
},
{
    205.92,213.04
     shoulder area will move up and down, the chest area will move back and forth, or the abdominal area
},
{
    213.04,217.92
     will go up and down. Now if your patient has like a severe disease process where the respiratory
},
{
    217.92,223.44
     system's being affected, like with congestive heart failure, a lot of fluid volume overload,
},
{
    223.44,230.08
     they have trouble breathing. So they're going to use these abdominal muscles to help pull in and out that air. You can actually
},
{
    230.08,235.36
     just see the abdomen going in and out. So that's really helpful whenever you're trying to figure
},
{
    235.36,240.88
     out the rate. Another tip you could do, but I would use this with discretion, depending on your
},
{
    240.88,246.16
     patient and how they are, would be whenever you go to feel that pulse rate,
},
{
    246.16,248.66
     you can lightly put your hand on their back,
},
{
    248.66,250.44
     on their chest or whatever,
},
{
    250.44,254.32
     so you can feel the rise and the fall of the chest.
},
{
    254.32,255.76
     But with some patients,
},
{
    255.76,257.4
     like if they're agitated, confused,
},
{
    257.4,259.64
     or there's just someone who really doesn't want you
},
{
    259.64,260.84
     in their personal space,
},
{
    260.84,261.7
     you wouldn't want to use this,
},
{
    261.7,263.36
     but with some patients, you can.
},
{
    263.36,268.08
     And my last tip would be to group it with your physical assessment.
},
{
    268.08,271.84
     Whenever you're going to assess the chest, you're going to listen to heart sounds and
},
{
    271.84,272.84
     lung sounds.
},
{
    272.84,276.12
     What you want to do is tell the patient, I'm going to listen to your heart sounds for
},
{
    276.12,279.04
     one full minute.
},
{
    279.04,282.6
     While you're there listening to both heart sounds and lung sounds, they're not going
},
{
    282.6,289.94
     to think that something's wrong. You're going to take your stethoscope and first you can listen to their breath sounds
},
{
    289.94,292.28
     and count that rate.
},
{
    292.28,295.72
     It's best to try to pick an area that you want to count that rate where there's not
},
{
    295.72,300.16
     a lot of adipose tissue because that can really muffle those breath sounds.
},
{
    300.16,307.44
     So generally at that second to fourth intercostal space anteriorly about mid-covicular, that could
},
{
    307.44,313.28
     be a great place to count those breath sounds. But again, it really depends on how your patient is
},
{
    313.28,318.48
     built. Then after you count that rate, then you can proceed and listen to their heart sounds.
},
{
    318.48,323.2
     Okay, so that wraps up this video on some tips for counting the respiratory rate. And be sure to
},
{
    323.2,328.8
     check out my other videos such as a head toto-toe assessment, how to assess heart and lung sounds along
},
{
    328.8,334.12
     with audio clips of abnormal lung sounds.
