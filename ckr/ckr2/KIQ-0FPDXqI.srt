{
    0.0,8.68
     So in this particular video, you're
},
{
    8.68,12.56
     going to see this patient and how they've progressed
},
{
    12.56,16.36
     as we've been teaching them a hip exercise that
},
{
    16.36,18.56
     has made a tremendous difference for them.
},
{
    18.56,22.24
     The patient, again, came in with severe back pain, hip pain,
},
{
    22.24,23.88
     pain going down the leg.
},
{
    23.88,26.44
     We found that they had a dysfunctional hip.
},
{
    26.44,29.44
     They weren't able to rotate their hip in a way.
},
{
    29.44,30.84
     So we've been doing adjustments.
},
{
    30.84,35.64
     And here is the video of us live showing them the exercise
},
{
    35.64,36.96
     and how much they've progressed.
},
{
    36.96,39.52
     Hopefully you enjoy it.
},
{
    39.52,42.8
     We've been working on his hip.
},
{
    42.8,47.0
     And I'm going to show you the exercise we've been doing. So you want to
},
{
    47.0,52.36
     hold on to the wall. Yep, actually go over here. We'll switch. So let's see. Do this
},
{
    52.36,56.36
     side and let's see how you're doing.
},
{
    63.36,67.0
     Okay, that's perfect.
},
{
    67.0,73.88
     Okay, so that is so much better than what we started before.
},
{
    73.88,75.88
     Now come up this way.
},
{
    75.88,77.36
     Try to cramp.
},
{
    77.36,81.6
     Okay, so you're going to cramp it first when you learn to do this.
},
{
    81.6,90.64
     So I'm going to do it with you because I need to work out, right? So we come up first and this is full flexion. Flexion is a fancy word for saying bring your knee
},
{
    90.64,96.72
     up to your chest. Then keeping your legs straight you go out like this without turning your belly
},
{
    96.72,101.36
     button. Now just like you're going over hurdles in high school you're going to bring your body
},
{
    101.36,109.48
     like this. Now some people will cramp there. Now you bring it back as far as you can to try to go to an extension as much kind of
},
{
    109.48,111.48
     back this way.
},
{
    111.48,115.0
     And then you drop the knee behind the other knee.
},
{
    115.0,118.36
     As if I always tell people if you're bowling, but most people don't bowl anymore.
},
{
    118.36,119.88
     It's not a popular thing.
},
{
    119.88,120.88
     You all right?
},
{
    120.88,121.88
     Yeah, I'm good.
},
{
    121.88,122.88
     Sorry.
},
{
    122.88,127.56
     I cramp too sometimes. It's a great, yeah, it's okay.
},
{
    127.56,129.64
     So if you cramp, the best thing to do
},
{
    129.64,132.74
     is to just kind of shake it out and weight a little bit.
},
{
    132.74,134.84
     And so what we've been doing with Freddie
},
{
    134.84,139.28
     is having him do three on one side, right?
},
{
    139.28,141.24
     And then three on the other.
},
{
    141.24,146.48
     And it's amazing how much better your hips feel. You know what I mean?
},
{
    146.48,149.88
     Yeah. Now the thing is the reason this is important is because if your hips
},
{
    149.88,154.52
     don't move good and there's muscular restriction and joint restriction what
},
{
    154.52,158.52
     ends up happening is you're gonna place more strain on your back and you add
},
{
    158.52,163.6
     back pain. So that's why we're doing this. So turn around face that way. Just
},
{
    163.6,166.24
     give back a little right here and hold
},
{
    166.24,174.08
     onto the wall. So you hold onto the wall so you don't fall. Because falling sucks. But the thing is
},
{
    174.08,178.8
     is that eventually if you get good at it you can do it like this without holding the wall.
},
{
    180.24,186.0
     Some people have better balance than others, it's no big deal. But you can definitely hold on to a wall like this.
},
{
    186.0,187.4
     Then the knee, this knee more.
},
{
    187.4,188.24
     There you go.
},
{
    188.24,190.36
     See, now it looks, now you got it behind there.
},
{
    190.36,194.32
     Now bring it up and out as if you're going over a hurdle.
},
{
    194.32,195.92
     Just like that.
},
{
    195.92,197.96
     And then you bring it back to here.
},
{
    197.96,199.56
     And then we just do another one.
},
{
    199.56,200.56
     Did you cramp on that one?
},
{
    200.56,202.72
     No, it's on the left one.
},
{
    202.72,203.52
     Yeah.
},
{
    203.52,208.4
     Okay, so go out like that. And this is just a range
},
{
    208.4,212.96
     of motion exercise, but you're actually using your muscles to take it through the range
},
{
    212.96,218.04
     of motion. So rather than just passive stretching, because some people will just pull their,
},
{
    218.04,221.56
     they'll lie on their back and they'll pull their knees to their chest, and they don't
},
{
    221.56,225.2
     actually work out the muscles and get as much joint
},
{
    225.2,231.4
     sensory information as if you do it this way and so it's a lot more
},
{
    231.4,237.92
     functional. So yeah you're doing so much better. That's awesome. Alright.
},
