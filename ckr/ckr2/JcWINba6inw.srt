     Hi guys, in this video we're going to show you how to find the trigger points that are
},
{
    6.24,10.88
     related to what we call the temporalis muscle, the muscle in the scalp area.
},
{
    10.88,13.98
     Dr. Jasper here from MuscleWizard.net.
},
{
    13.98,18.36
     There's four different areas that usually give people tension headaches, headaches coming
},
{
    18.36,19.36
     from trigger points.
},
{
    19.36,24.6
     There are muscles in the front of the neck, the back of the neck, the upper shoulders,
},
{
    24.6,27.76
     in the jaw, and actually in the scalp also.
},
{
    27.76,29.84
     So what it is is there's a muscle called the temporalis.
},
{
    29.84,33.98
     I'm just going to show you guys how to find that muscle right now.
},
{
    33.98,38.56
     And the way to do that is it's a muscle that goes from back here and it comes in a straight
},
{
    38.56,41.74
     line all the way just below the eye.
},
{
    41.74,49.6
     One of the ways to find this out is you got your cheekbone right here. You just go one finger breath up and extend that finger all the way back
},
{
    49.6,56.56
     to just on top of the ear and that's the line. So right from about here you can
},
{
    56.56,63.4
     press into that muscle right into there, there, there and there. That's that whole
},
{
    63.4,66.02
     area that can give you the headaches. Now if
},
{
    66.02,69.24
     you press a little bit more into the front of the near to the back of the eye
},
{
    69.24,73.62
     you're going to get headaches into this area. The more you go back you're going to
},
{
    73.62,77.4
     get headaches about there and the more you go back you're going to get them going
},
{
    77.4,80.84
     back to about there. Now another interesting thing about this muscle is
},
{
    80.84,88.84
     this muscle can also give you teeth pain. So somebody who has a toothache that go to their dentist and the dentist says everything's fine they
},
{
    88.84,92.88
     can't figure out where that toothache is coming from. Surprisingly this muscle can
},
{
    92.88,96.08
     also give you that but at the end of the day if you've got a lot of tension
},
{
    96.08,100.04
     headaches in the in the head area you want to start hitting that muscle also.
},
{
    100.04,104.04
     A lot of people forget about this guy they also forget about some of the
},
{
    104.04,105.36
     muscles in the jaw.
},
{
    105.36,106.96
     We're always focused on the neck,
},
{
    106.96,108.24
     but really at the end of the day,
},
{
    108.24,110.52
     you wanna hit that temporalis muscle.
},
{
    110.52,114.0
     Hold the spot, find the spot, hold it for a few seconds,
},
{
    114.0,116.04
     see if it recreates the headache.
},
{
    116.04,117.44
     And then if it does recreate the headache,
},
{
    117.44,118.72
     see if it starts going down,
},
{
    118.72,120.44
     and then you can press a little bit harder.
},
{
    120.44,124.36
     Also, what you can do, just kinda massage into that area.
},
{
    124.36,127.0
     You can do both ways, just pressing or massaging into it.
},
{
    127.0,128.4
     That's it.
},
{
    128.4,131.2
     That's the Temporalis and it's a very easy muscle to get.
},
{
    131.2,134.0
     Try that out and see if that decreases your headaches.
},
{
    134.0,136.0
     Also, remember, there's a lot of different muscles
},
{
    136.0,137.2
     that can give the headaches.
},
{
    137.2,138.6
     If you go to MuscleWizard.net,
},
{
    138.6,141.6
     we got a lot of different articles on all the other muscles also
},
{
    141.6,143.2
     and a lot of other videos.
},
{
    143.2,145.5
     We'll see you guys probably in the next video.
},
{
    145.5,146.5
     Thanks.
