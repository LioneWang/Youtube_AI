     Hi, my name is Sherri Garvin. I'm one of the pharmacists here at the Compounding Center
},
{
    10.84,15.84
     and today I'm going to talk to you about applying your hormone cream. First, I want to congratulate
},
{
    15.84,21.08
     you on taking a big step towards relieving your symptoms. My job is easy. I'm just going
},
{
    21.08,28.36
     to show you how to apply it so that you can start to feel better, feel more like yourself again. So at the compounding center we dispense
},
{
    28.36,35.08
     our hormone, hormone creams in an airless pump and each pump delivers point
},
{
    35.08,41.76
     two five grams. It's a very small amount. Now we make your cream based on your
},
{
    41.76,45.16
     physician's order and then we will put on the label your
},
{
    45.16,46.52
     directions for use.
},
{
    46.52,51.4
     So your physician may want you to use one pump twice a day or four pumps once a day.
},
{
    51.4,54.56
     It'll vary, so just follow the directions on your labeling.
},
{
    54.56,58.0
     Now, ladies, where we can put this.
},
{
    58.0,62.24
     Usually the inner forearm is a great place to put it, and you can just rub your two forearms
},
{
    62.24,67.0
     together, and it just takes a very few seconds
},
{
    67.0,69.44
     for it to rub into the skin.
},
{
    69.44,71.84
     You can also use your inner thigh.
},
{
    71.84,75.4
     Some physicians recommend the neck or the inner bicep.
},
{
    75.4,80.12
     I would suggest talking to your physician if they have specific instructions for you.
},
{
    80.12,86.24
     And gentlemen, your cream will look very much like this, and you can apply yours on the upper torso
},
{
    86.24,88.06
     anywhere in this area,
},
{
    88.06,91.38
     just trying to avoid the more hairy areas.
},
{
    91.38,93.64
     Now a few tips and pointers.
},
{
    93.64,97.4
     If you are using your hands to apply the cream,
},
{
    97.4,100.3
     say on your neck, then you wanna make sure right afterwards
},
{
    100.3,103.44
     to wash your hands so that you don't transfer the cream
},
{
    103.44,110.0
     to a loved one or someone else that you may come in contact with. Also, sometimes you might hit an
},
{
    110.0,115.12
     air bubble. So if you dispense a pump and it spurts or it doesn't look like the
},
{
    115.12,119.88
     correct amount, then you just want to go ahead and discard that and start all
},
{
    119.88,124.32
     over again. We do overfill our pumps a little bit so that you have plenty in
},
{
    124.32,129.64
     case you hit an air bubble. And one last thing, we do usually recommend that you
},
{
    129.64,134.12
     rotate application sites. It helps so that the cream doesn't cause any
},
{
    134.12,138.92
     irritation and also encourages absorption of the active ingredient. We hope this has
},
{
    138.92,142.24
     helped today but if you do have any further questions, feel free to call our
},
{
    142.24,146.4
     pharmacist here at the Compounding Center. Thank you!
