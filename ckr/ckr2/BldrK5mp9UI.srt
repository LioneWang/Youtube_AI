     Hey everybody it's Doctor Jo and today I'm going to show you seven ways to prevent varicose veins
},
{
    4.48,8.96
     and spider veins. So let's get started. Disclamer alert, disclaimer alert!
},
{
    11.84,16.64
     So with varicose veins and spider veins they happen because we're not getting enough circulation
},
{
    16.64,23.92
     to our legs. The varicose veins are those very thick cord-like veins that pop out of the skin.
},
{
    23.92,26.3
     They're really sometimes tender to the touch,
},
{
    26.3,29.2
     and they're at risk of actually bursting
},
{
    29.2,31.0
     and causing severe bleeding.
},
{
    31.0,32.08
     So those are really scary.
},
{
    32.08,35.16
     Spider veins are the ones that you can see
},
{
    35.16,36.92
     that are the kind of purpley veins
},
{
    36.92,38.64
     that come to the surface.
},
{
    38.64,40.12
     Sometimes it's caused by injury,
},
{
    40.12,42.12
     sometimes it's caused by poor circulation.
},
{
    42.12,45.28
     I do have some at my ankles, so I work on those a lot.
},
{
    45.28,49.76
     So that's kind of the difference. The spider ones aren't quite as scary but the varicose veins are
},
{
    49.76,55.04
     the ones that kind of pop out and are very cord-like. So the best way to help prevent those
},
{
    55.04,59.44
     is to get the circulation in your legs and so especially if you have a desk job or you're
},
{
    59.44,63.68
     sitting a lot all day you really want to keep them moving and one of the easiest things to do
},
{
    63.68,69.84
     is a simple ankle pump. So with an ankle pump, all you're doing is just like it sounds, you're pumping it down
},
{
    69.84,76.72
     and pulling it back up. And so that's working that calf muscle to just almost act like a natural pump
},
{
    76.72,83.2
     to get that blood flowing through your legs back into your system, getting the oxygen back in your
},
{
    83.2,85.6
     blood and circulating it through your body.
},
{
    85.6,90.24
     So with ankle pumps, you really can't do too many. You can do them all throughout the day. You can
},
{
    90.24,95.6
     do them sitting like I'm doing. You can do them lying down in bed. You can, you know, even stand up
},
{
    95.6,101.6
     and pump if you want to. So they're super easy to do, and I really like them. You know, so 10 to 15
},
{
    102.32,107.12
     several times throughout the day. So then the next thing is a seated heel
},
{
    107.12,111.84
     toe raise. So this time it's almost like an ankle pump, but now you're using the floor to give you
},
{
    111.84,116.56
     a little bit of resistance. So you're working those muscles a little bit more. And all it is
},
{
    116.56,120.64
     is you're coming up with the the heels and then you're coming back down and then you're coming
},
{
    120.64,128.76
     up with your toes. So you're just alternating back and forth just kind of raising those heels, raising those toes. That's why they're
},
{
    128.76,132.4
     called heel-toe raises. But you're getting a little bit of push off from the
},
{
    132.4,136.08
     floor, a little bit of feedback, so it's working those muscles a little bit more.
},
{
    136.08,139.68
     So another great way to prevent fair-coast veins and spider veins is
},
{
    139.68,144.76
     using compression stockings, hose, or socks. And so the folks at Jomi Compression
},
{
    144.76,145.4
     sent me their Jomi Compression thigh-high socks. And so the folks at Jomi Compression sent
},
{
    145.4,150.04
     me their Jomi Compression thigh high socks. And as you can see, an array of
},
{
    150.04,155.96
     other things. So what's really great about compression hose is it helps get
},
{
    155.96,160.16
     that circulation moving a little bit better with that compression. So if my
},
{
    160.16,163.88
     blood likes to pull down at my legs and I'm not getting a lot of movement, this
},
{
    163.88,166.32
     helps work it back into my system.
},
{
    166.32,169.76
     And so the thigh highs are really nice because they cross over the knees.
},
{
    169.76,173.28
     So sometimes people have swelling and their knees all the way down into their legs and
},
{
    173.28,175.56
     that's when you can use the thigh highs.
},
{
    175.56,179.16
     Sometimes you just have it down in the lower part of your legs and then you can use the
},
{
    179.16,187.04
     knee highs or they even have things like a men's leotard or the women's for maternity as well. So they've got
},
{
    187.04,191.76
     a lot of different varieties and you can see a lot of different colors. They also have some products
},
{
    191.76,196.64
     that help you get them on because sometimes with compression stockings and hose they're a little bit
},
{
    196.64,201.44
     difficult for some people. I don't find it too hard but I help people put them on all the time.
},
{
    201.44,210.08
     So I'm going to put these on and just kind of show you what they look like real quick. Boink! And they're on. So you can see these thigh highs have an open toe and a
},
{
    210.08,214.56
     lot of times that just helps for a little bit more breathability. So if you have feet, they get a
},
{
    214.56,220.16
     little more sweaty. Sometimes the open toes work really well for you. There's also some silicone
},
{
    220.16,224.48
     on the top here and that helps prevent it from sliding back down, which is really nice because
},
{
    224.48,227.54
     some brands don't have that and they do slide down pretty easily and
},
{
    227.54,232.62
     so I'll show you here on these as well that it has that silicone on there that
},
{
    232.62,237.02
     is really nice and so what's really again great is you can see it comes all the
},
{
    237.02,241.46
     way up to the thigh so it's crossing over the knees if you don't have any
},
{
    241.46,245.0
     problems with your knees those knee high ones work fine as well.
},
{
    245.0,249.0
     But again, you can go full body and give that great compression.
},
{
    249.0,255.0
     So not only are these great for varicose veins, spider veins, but it also helps with just general fatigue.
},
{
    255.0,262.0
     And then it can also help prevent DVTs, which are those deep vein thrombosis scary things.
},
{
    262.0,266.6
     And then also even just muscle soreness in general. So it's a
},
{
    266.6,270.52
     great product to use for a variety of different things but it really helps
},
{
    270.52,274.6
     increase that circulation and protect those veins for the varicose veins and
},
{
    274.6,277.84
     those spider veins. So if you're interested in purchasing any of the
},
{
    277.84,281.4
     joeming compression products make sure and click on the link up there. So now
},
{
    281.4,284.12
     we're going to do some standing stretches and exercise and it's always
},
{
    284.12,286.44
     good to do some stuff standing so you're getting that body weight there. So now we're going to do some standing stretches and exercise. And it's always good to do some stuff standing so you're getting that body
},
{
    286.44,289.84
     weight resistance. So the next one is going to be a runner stretch and that
},
{
    289.84,293.32
     stretches out your calf muscle and your Achilles. And so it's really good to
},
{
    293.32,296.84
     give that flexibility in there to help prevent those sphidrophanes and those
},
{
    296.84,301.4
     varicose veins. So if I'm stretching my left side, the pink side, I'm going to put
},
{
    301.4,305.48
     that foot back. I want to keep my heel down and I want to
},
{
    305.48,308.72
     keep my toes pointed forward. Sometimes people want to turn their foot out like
},
{
    308.72,311.58
     that, but then you're not going to get the right stretch. So keep those toes
},
{
    311.58,316.44
     pointed forward, bring the other one forward, and you can bend this knee, but
},
{
    316.44,321.6
     keep this knee locked out straight. So then you're just going to hold on to
},
{
    321.6,329.4
     something you can do it against a wall, you can hold on to a countertop or to a chair, and you're just going to lean in until you feel that stretch and you're just going to hold on to something you can do it against a wall, you can hold on to a counter top or to a chair and you're just going to lean in until you feel that
},
{
    329.4,331.04
     stretch in your calf muscle.
},
{
    331.04,332.96
     But keeping that heel down the whole time.
},
{
    332.96,336.32
     If I bring my heel up then I'm not stretching that calf anymore.
},
{
    336.32,342.28
     If you need to put the foot further back you can and then really get a stretch forward.
},
{
    342.28,345.56
     So since this is a full stretch, you want to hold it for
},
{
    345.56,350.56
     30 seconds. I like to alternate back and forth just to give each side a rest, so
},
{
    350.56,356.6
     you do 30 seconds on each side. So then the next one is going to be just a
},
{
    356.6,362.04
     single leg heel raise. So you might want to start off with two, but if you're
},
{
    362.04,368.08
     getting standing up and you're getting a little bit stronger, you can do a single leg heel raise. So two would
},
{
    368.08,373.26
     just be going up this way and slowly coming back down. But one, you're just
},
{
    373.26,377.08
     going to do one side at a time. Make sure you have something to hold on to,
},
{
    377.08,381.6
     sturdy. The first couple times you do it, once you get advanced you can do it
},
{
    381.6,384.68
     without holding on to anything, but just make sure you have your balance so you
},
{
    384.68,386.28
     can focus on the movement.
},
{
    386.28,388.0
     So you want to go slow and controlled.
},
{
    388.0,389.84
     You don't want to just do this.
},
{
    389.84,392.92
     That's not really beneficial and that's just using momentum.
},
{
    392.92,399.56
     So really come up, bring that heel as high as you can and then just nice and slow come
},
{
    399.56,400.56
     back down.
},
{
    400.56,406.76
     So again if this is too much for you make sure you're doing two, but one is really going to work that calf muscle and
},
{
    406.84,409.6
     help prevent those spider veins and maricose veins.
},
{
    409.6,413.36
     And then so the last one is just a simple squat,
},
{
    413.48,419.86
     but make sure again you're doing the squat correctly if you need the chair behind you so you can sit down if you
},
{
    419.86,422.02
     feel like you can't come all the way up, that's fine.
},
{
    422.02,428.88
     But with a squat, you really just want to keep your feet about shoulder width apart. You can go a little further out, that makes it a little
},
{
    428.88,435.2
     bit easier. Toes pointing forward and when you squat down you really want to bring your bottom back.
},
{
    435.2,440.08
     So your toes, you should always be able to see them. If I'm bringing my knees in front of my toes
},
{
    440.08,446.22
     and I can't see my toes, I'm not squatting right. You really wanna stick your bottom back behind you
},
{
    446.22,448.44
     so you can see your toes the whole time.
},
{
    448.44,450.76
     And keep the weight shifted equally
},
{
    450.76,451.88
     on your heels and your toes.
},
{
    451.88,454.36
     So I'm not coming up on my toes like this
},
{
    454.36,457.08
     and I'm not leaning back where I'm almost falling back.
},
{
    457.08,461.16
     So really shift your weight back into that booty,
},
{
    461.16,463.24
     bring your chest forward just a little bit
},
{
    463.24,469.78
     and that helps even everything out. So depending on how easy these are for you is how far you can go
},
{
    469.78,474.92
     down. So you might just want to do a little mini squat and that's fine or you
},
{
    474.92,478.86
     can go just a little bit deeper but make sure you're using correct form. So again
},
{
    478.86,484.42
     just starting off with 10 to 15 maybe two sets a couple times a day. So those
},
{
    484.42,485.6
     were seven ways to prevent
},
{
    485.6,488.72
     varicose veins and spider veins. If you're interested in purchasing the
},
{
    488.72,492.08
