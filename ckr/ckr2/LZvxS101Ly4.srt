     Did you just break your ankle?
},
{
    5.32,9.56
     Whether it's the inside of your ankle, outside of your ankle, don't live in that thing for
},
{
    9.56,12.12
     six plus months with complications.
},
{
    12.12,18.8
     These 25 tips are proven effective, practical, low-cost treatments to pretty much ensure that
},
{
    18.8,22.08
     you're not going to have any long-term problems and you're going to start feeling better as
},
{
    22.08,34.88
     soon as possible. So don't miss these tips and we're starting now. How did you get your broken ankle? Is it a sports injury? Did you fall down the
},
{
    34.88,43.28
     stairs? A car accident? Did you trip over a cute little dog or cat? Let us know. These are crazy
},
{
    43.28,46.2
     injuries. They take so much longer to get better
},
{
    46.2,47.8
     than we initially think.
},
{
    47.8,49.56
     The number one thing I hear is,
},
{
    49.56,52.64
     I did not think it would be this long
},
{
    52.64,55.16
     and I did not think it would be this hard.
},
{
    55.16,59.6
     So with that in mind, these are the 25 best tips.
},
{
    59.6,62.28
     It's so many tips I haven't written down here
},
{
    62.28,64.48
     but I won't even number them in this video.
},
{
    64.48,67.2
     So how long does it take to heal a broken ankle?
},
{
    67.2,71.04
     I always tell people for one to two weeks, you're going to be in a ton of pain, whether
},
{
    71.04,76.78
     you need surgery, whether it's really broken, but the inflammation takes one to two weeks.
},
{
    76.78,81.94
     The next thing is for about four to six weeks, you're in a cast protected during that whole
},
{
    81.94,82.94
     time.
},
{
    82.94,89.76
     And then for about another four to six weeks you're in a walking boot. And then for another four to six weeks you're in a good shoe with a lace-up ankle
},
{
    89.76,95.28
     brace. Number one, this is the single most important tip. Work with a doctor. This is not meant to be
},
{
    95.28,100.48
     a second opinion here. We're not going to be telling you somebody's right or wrong what you have to do.
},
{
    100.48,104.88
     You have to trust somebody because there's so many different factors in a broken ankle. Do you need
},
{
    104.88,108.48
     a surgery? Do you need a cast? Do you need a boot. That's something you should talk about
},
{
    108.48,114.08
     with your doctor. These are general tips that will work for every one of these.
},
{
    114.08,119.44
     So number one is in the first week or two, you're going to have a lot of pain. All broken
},
{
    119.44,126.8
     ankles hurt. You're going to have purple, bruisedised swelling. So what you want to do is the price
},
{
    126.8,132.72
     method. There's a lot of debate regarding this. Does it heal quicker or is it pain relief?
},
{
    132.72,137.88
     Realistically, the rice method is for pain relief. It's not for faster healing. So you
},
{
    137.88,143.24
     want to elevate. You want to ice. You want to add some compression to get that swelling
},
{
    143.24,148.34
     out of there. You want to elevate your foot so you want it high up when you're resting and watching
},
{
    148.34,149.34
     TV.
},
{
    149.34,152.88
     Your swelling will come down quicker, your pain will feel better.
},
{
    152.88,157.46
     You can put some ice behind your knee if you don't have any health conditions preventing
},
{
    157.46,161.8
     you from doing so, especially the first couple of nights because the nerves down to your
},
{
    161.8,166.1
     foot go behind your knee and that's gonna really reduce your pain.
},
{
    166.1,167.68
     So about 20 minutes at a time,
},
{
    167.68,169.32
     put some ice while you're watching TV,
},
{
    169.32,170.96
     your pain will feel better.
},
{
    170.96,173.2
     Anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen,
},
{
    173.2,175.84
     studies do show they can slow down bone healing,
},
{
    175.84,179.04
     but really you're not gonna be taking these all the time.
},
{
    179.04,181.36
     So what happens is if you're in a lot of pain,
},
{
    181.36,184.74
     pain medications and anti-inflammatories can help
},
{
    184.74,186.08
     if your doctor is okay with it and you're healthy enough to take pain, pain medications and anti-inflammatories can help if your doctor is okay
},
{
    186.08,188.16
     with it and you're healthy enough to take them.
},
{
    188.16,190.7
     So the thing is too, the first week or two,
},
{
    190.7,194.42
     you have the energy to really scooch around and walk around,
},
{
    194.42,197.9
     but what you wanna do is you wanna plan out
},
{
    197.9,200.6
     because this is gonna be three plus months.
},
{
    200.6,202.96
     You want to pick everything up off the floor
},
{
    202.96,208.46
     because when you have a broken ankle and you're by yourself you want to have stuff up on your bed or up on your
},
{
    208.46,213.98
     counter. This means things like food, your alarm clocks, your phone chargers, your
},
{
    213.98,218.32
     vitamins, your ice. You don't want stuff down low on the floor because you're
},
{
    218.32,222.34
     bending over, you're straining your back, you're gonna have a hard time doing that.
},
{
    222.34,230.08
     Make sure someone's available to help you for the first week or two, probably even longer so you don't want to be going upstairs, you don't
},
{
    230.08,235.84
     want to be doing your own groceries if you don't have to. So plan ahead, start thinking about this
},
{
    235.84,242.4
     kind of stuff because very quickly you're going to start getting pretty sore. Get a shower chair.
},
{
    242.4,245.64
     When you're showering, you're going to have a cast number one.
},
{
    245.64,247.52
     You're going to have to have it protected.
},
{
    247.52,253.56
     Buy a cheap chair for a couple dollars at a grocery store or Walmart or wherever and
},
{
    253.56,254.64
     sit on it.
},
{
    254.64,256.98
     That's an easy, easy tip.
},
{
    256.98,259.76
     Get Netflix, Disney Plus or Hulu.
},
{
    259.76,263.34
     On demand will save your life while you have a broken ankle.
},
{
    263.34,269.88
     You want to resist the urge to constantly keep doing stuff. You have to relax because not re-aggravating
},
{
    269.88,275.2
     it is what's going to help it heal the quickest. Get a bag online for your foot.
},
{
    275.2,280.4
     So it's a suction cup that comes around above your ankle so you can take a
},
{
    280.4,286.56
     shower. These work great. Personally I always wrap the cast then I put that suction cup
},
{
    286.56,290.32
     on it because if you get your cast wet you have to call your doctor and get it changed like an
},
{
    290.32,297.92
     emergency. Buy your durable medical equipment. So your knee scooter or your eye walk 2.0 or your
},
{
    297.92,307.28
     walker. If your insurance isn't great which most people's are not. You're going to pay really inflated prices for these things.
},
{
    307.28,310.08
     Look online for these knee scooters. They're $100.
},
{
    310.08,313.76
     That being said, if it's covered, get it. But if the price is outrageous,
},
{
    313.76,317.28
     buy it online for a more cost-effective price.
},
{
    317.28,320.48
     Use your butt. When going up the stairs,
},
{
    320.48,324.96
     scooch butt first up and down. Don't try and walk on your foot.
},
{
    324.96,325.1
     If you tip over, you're really going to hurt yourself and make sure someone's Scooch butt first up and down. Don't try and walk on your foot.
},
{
    325.1,327.86
     If you tip over, you're really going to hurt yourself
},
{
    327.86,330.62
     and make sure someone's always available to help you.
},
{
    330.62,332.26
     Take a daily multi-vitamin.
},
{
    332.26,335.34
     If your doctor is okay with it, especially vitamin D.
},
{
    335.34,337.34
     80 plus percent of people in America,
},
{
    337.34,340.34
     especially up here in Michigan or where I lived in Canada,
},
{
    340.34,342.42
     everybody's vitamin D deficient.
},
{
    342.42,344.9
     Make sure you get a few thousand units,
},
{
    344.9,346.54
     especially with a broken bone. If you live in a warm area, make sure you get a few thousand units, especially with a broken bone.
},
{
    346.54,347.92
     If you live in a warm area,
},
{
    347.92,349.56
     make sure you get outside and get some sun,
},
{
    349.56,350.88
     sit by a window.
},
{
    350.88,352.92
     Make sure you're getting enough protein.
},
{
    352.92,357.92
     A lot of studies show with 1.6 grams per kilogram per day,
},
{
    358.76,360.48
     your muscles recover quicker,
},
{
    360.48,363.56
     this can be extrapolated onto your bones as well,
},
{
    363.56,366.04
     and your immune system is stronger
},
{
    366.04,368.92
     too, especially in the coronavirus era.
},
{
    368.92,370.7
     You want to be as healthy as possible.
},
{
    370.7,373.5
     Make sure you're getting enough protein and healthy eating.
},
{
    373.5,376.04
     On that note, don't smoke.
},
{
    376.04,377.72
     Don't drink alcohol.
},
{
    377.72,379.8
     These will slow things down.
},
{
    379.8,382.64
     They will for sure slow down your healing.
},
{
    382.64,385.2
     Make sure you're sleeping at least eight hours a day.
},
{
    385.2,389.04
     Everyone's a little bit different but more sleep generally equals more healing.
},
{
    389.76,395.52
     Don't test the broken bone. Trust your doctor. This takes a very long time to get better.
},
{
    395.52,400.72
     And what happens is if you're not ready to walk on it, don't test it. This is where people really
},
{
    400.72,407.16
     slow down their healing process is by re-eggervating it. That's why most of these tips are preventative.
},
{
    407.16,409.16
     Start slow with everything.
},
{
    409.16,411.48
     Don't plan heavy duty activities,
},
{
    411.48,413.36
     especially after you break your foot.
},
{
    413.36,415.04
     Plan light activities.
},
{
    415.04,416.52
     As you're starting to get better,
},
{
    416.52,419.08
     maybe five minutes of scooching around on your boot
},
{
    419.08,420.08
     with a walker.
},
{
    420.08,422.8
     Don't plan for a full day getting back to work.
},
{
    422.8,428.52
     This is where things like work notes come in, disability, handicap parking passes.
},
{
    428.52,433.12
     So as a podiatrist or your orthopedic doctor who sees you for your foot or your broken
},
{
    433.12,435.96
     leg, you want to get a work note for sure.
},
{
    435.96,437.48
     Get something for disability.
},
{
    437.48,442.88
     Work will generally send back a more detailed letter to have filled out, but you want to
},
{
    442.88,445.76
     get a handicap parking pass at all.
},
{
    445.76,452.64
     If you work from home, get exemptions or if you work in a sit down job, get special seating,
},
{
    452.64,458.52
     get a rubber mat for your other foot, get time to rest if you're sore.
},
{
    458.52,460.28
     Don't plan on working a 12 hour day.
},
{
    460.28,465.9
     I know it's hard for a lot of people, but you're going to realize how tiring it is having a broken leg.
},
{
    466.0,472.4
     You're on medications, you're not feeling well, you're not sleeping as well. Start slow. Use a couple
},
{
    472.86,479.58
     vacation or disability days, even if you think you might be able to work. That is probably the single biggest tip
},
{
    479.58,489.0
     I would recommend right off the bat. As you move through the healing process, first you're generally going to start with a cast, especially if you had surgery. I always
},
{
    489.0,493.24
     start patients off with a cast to protect them, then gradually you move into a
},
{
    493.24,497.68
     walking boot, then gradually you move into a shoe with an ankle brace. So plan
},
{
    497.68,503.1
     for that. This is how you put on a walking boot. So I'm a big fan of the tall
},
{
    503.1,507.56
     air walker. The little one doesn't give you as much support. It's almost like what's the point. You might
},
{
    507.56,511.42
     as well not even use it at that point. I consider that cheating because it
},
{
    511.42,514.94
     doesn't support you as well. It doesn't take pressure off the ankle. You want to
},
{
    514.94,519.3
     make sure the liner is above the plastic rim that can really hurt your calf and
},
{
    519.3,523.78
     cause a lot of bruising. And you want to make sure your foot fits in pretty well.
},
{
    523.78,525.52
     Your toes should be around the
},
{
    525.52,529.84
     edge. It doesn't have to be exact because you're not supposed to walk on it in the first place.
},
{
    530.4,537.28
     But you have a compression sock and then a more full sock. And the beauty is that gives you a lot
},
{
    537.28,541.6
     of padding. So you have compression, which limits swelling. And then the thicker sock gives you
},
{
    541.6,545.76
     some cushion and then an insole on top of that. So some of them
},
{
    545.76,551.68
     in the recommended notes, that's a great combo. Thick sock, compression sock, and an insole that
},
{
    551.68,555.84
     lets you put some weight on it, get into the bathroom, that kind of thing without much pain.
},
{
    555.84,560.96
     And then pump it up, make sure that air bladders in there. It keeps you from moving around. It
},
{
    560.96,565.28
     keeps you much more stable. It keeps the axial load off your ankle.
},
{
    565.28,569.4
     I always recommend people buy an ankle brace for the future.
},
{
    569.4,572.88
     Check out different boots to see what works best for you.
},
{
    572.88,576.16
     Tall boots are the way to go because they protect you more.
},
{
    576.16,580.64
     But then some good ankle braces that go into a good shoe.
},
{
    580.64,585.56
     A good tennis shoe with a good ankle brace will work wonders for you, especially as you
},
{
    585.56,586.56
     get out of the boot.
},
{
    586.56,590.04
     You don't want to get out of your boot and go straight into a flip-flop or barefoot.
},
{
    590.04,591.74
     You're going to be in a ton of pain.
},
{
    591.74,593.0
     You're going to be stiff.
},
{
    593.0,594.0
     You're back.
},
{
    594.0,595.0
     You're hip.
},
{
    595.0,597.52
     Your other leg is going to be killing you.
},
{
    597.52,600.8
     So return gradually to work, to walking.
},
{
    600.8,605.64
     Use assistive devices, the braces, the great shoes, the orthotics inside the shoe.
},
{
    605.64,610.56
     Get protein powder. I'm a huge fan of supplementing with protein powder or at
},
{
    610.56,616.64
     least the lean protein rich foods. Buy your toiletries ahead of time or people
},
{
    616.64,622.56
     that can help you. So you're deodorant, you're soap, everything. Make sure it's
},
{
    622.56,625.96
     easier to access this stuff. Have it all laid out ahead of time
},
{
    625.96,627.96
     So you don't have to jump between different places
},
{
    628.36,632.54
     Maybe set up your own special bathroom with your stuff that nobody moves for you
},
{
    632.64,637.64
     Because it's tough if you have to run across the house to get different pants or different socks or different deodorant
},
{
    637.64,641.48
     You're going to get fatigued and you're going to be very bitter at your family
},
{
    641.8,645.16
     Use things to help you as you're recovering. So baby
},
{
    645.16,650.5
     strollers, shopping carts, at grocery stores, get those little old person
},
{
    650.5,654.6
     buggies with the little horn. Yeah, sometimes people are embarrassed to use
},
{
    654.6,659.28
     them, but use them. That's an investment in your quicker recovery. Don't leave
},
{
    659.28,662.56
     anything on the ground. If stuff's down on the ground, you're going to hurt your
},
{
    662.56,667.46
     back and hip. For maybe one week that's's okay, but it's going to take you at least three months to
},
{
    667.46,669.24
     heal this broken ankle.
},
{
    669.24,670.52
     Pretty much guaranteed.
},
{
    670.52,672.32
     So think about the future.
},
{
    672.32,675.24
     You're going to really suffer in a couple weeks.
},
{
    675.24,676.48
     Stretching and exercises.
},
{
    676.48,677.48
     Here's the deal.
},
{
    677.48,681.48
     Once you're out of the cast, then out of the boot, then still walking in the brace and
},
{
    681.48,685.36
     the shoe, you need to stretch your lower back, your hips,
},
{
    685.36,691.44
     your hamstring, the back of your knees, your calf muscles. What we usually see is people heal
},
{
    691.44,696.48
     their bone completely, but they're so tight and scarred up and stiff that they're having pain
},
{
    696.48,701.92
     six to 12 months later, maybe even more. Nobody really wants to go to physical therapy because
},
{
    701.92,707.24
     the co-pays can be so high these days, but highly highly recommended.
},
{
    707.24,709.0
     If not use stretching devices.
},
{
    709.0,713.08
     I love ankle stretch boards, but watch this stretching video right here.
},
{
    713.08,714.84
     This will help a ton.
},
{
    714.84,716.52
     Everyone always wants to know exercise.
},
{
    716.52,718.9
     So here it is, a massage roller stick.
},
{
    718.9,721.64
     This is $10 or less online.
},
{
    721.64,722.88
     Check the show notes.
},
{
    722.88,725.92
     But you have to massage out your calf muscle. Your
},
{
    725.92,731.96
     Achilles tendon, even your planar fascia. Studies show that doing this for 30 to 60
},
{
    731.96,738.66
     seconds per muscle group gives you a few hours of relaxed and flexible muscles. So even for
},
{
    738.66,747.16
     the planar fascia, I love to massage the planar fascia. The idea is you're squeezing the fluid out of the ligaments,
},
{
    747.16,750.72
     the tendons in your foot, in your calf muscle.
},
{
    750.72,752.52
     So the ball doesn't work great
},
{
    752.52,754.08
     anywhere except the bottom of your foot.
},
{
    754.08,756.0
     You wanna use the massage roller stick
},
{
    756.0,759.16
     I was using on your calf and your Achilles tendon.
},
{
    759.16,761.16
     And you can use it on your thigh too.
},
{
    761.16,764.92
     You want loose thigh muscles, loose hamstring muscles,
},
{
    764.92,766.32
     so there's less pressure
},
{
    766.32,772.4
     on your calf muscle, but you could really focus time on your Achilles tendon, but you
},
{
    772.4,777.12
     don't want to damage it. You don't want to hurt it and look it for a couple hours afterwards
},
{
    777.12,786.28
     or a work shift afterwards, you can then stretch. So now I'm gently stretching my Achilles tendonitis. You never and I repeat never
},
{
    786.28,792.46
     want to cause pain. If something is torn, if something is partially torn, or if you have
},
{
    792.46,798.12
     crippling pain while stretching, stop. That means you have to heal. You might have an
},
{
    798.12,806.62
     injury and you have to get that checked out with your pediatist or foot care specialist because you could be spreading
},
{
    806.62,808.28
     and tearing further.
},
{
    808.28,813.2
     But look at before that massage and gentle stretch, I couldn't even touch my toes.
},
{
    813.2,816.14
     But now look at way past my toes.
},
{
    816.14,820.82
     You know, if I really keep doing this, sometimes I can make it all the way up to my elbow.
},
{
    820.82,824.46
     Whereas in the morning when I get up, I can't even touch my toes.
},
{
    824.46,825.86
     That's insane.
},
{
    825.86,829.46
     So that's how much the massage and the stretching combo does.
},
{
    829.46,836.1
     The trifecta of great shoes, a great brace, and great orthotics will work wonders for
},
{
    836.1,840.02
     you. They will support your foot. They're going to help your knees, your feet, your
},
{
    840.02,845.3
     ankles. If you have other health conditions, if you smoke, if you have diabetes, if you're on
},
{
    845.3,850.44
     dialysis, if you have other hip replacements, talk with your doctor ahead about these things
},
{
    850.44,853.14
     because this is really where people have problems.
},
{
    853.14,857.4
     If you're just a teenager like 13 or 14 years old, you're pretty much guaranteed to heal
},
{
    857.4,861.22
     up quickly if the initial bone is set back in that place.
},
{
    861.22,866.24
     But as you get 40, 50, 60, 70, you're going to have a ton of other
},
{
    866.24,872.88
     joint pains and problems. Can you drive with a boot or a cast? The answer is no. It's illegal.
},
{
    872.88,878.4
     There's no rule about how injured your foot or leg can be. But with a cast, if it's on
},
{
    878.4,884.08
     your right foot, then you can't drive realistically until you're able to use your foot and you're
},
{
    884.08,885.12
     not in a boot. You should not drive. You should have somebody help you. Realistically, until you're able to use your foot and you're not in a boot, you
},
{
    885.12,888.88
     should not drive. You should have somebody help you. And realistically, you should either
},
{
    888.88,894.16
     be working from home if you can or you should be on disability until you get better because
},
{
    894.16,898.84
     that's where people put themselves at risk. Also, get yourself a handicap pass. So if your
},
{
    898.84,905.48
     husband or wife drives you around, get a handicap pass so you can get in or out easier if it makes your life easier.
},
{
    905.48,910.2
     Talk to work, talk to school, see how they can help you.
},
{
    910.2,913.6
     Usually HR departments really try to help you.
},
{
    913.6,918.32
     The days of like the 1920s where they don't help you are over.
},
{
    918.32,920.88
     Companies generally really try to help you now.
},
{
    920.88,924.2
     Employers are really good about this stuff based on what I see.
},
{
    924.2,926.08
     So that brings me to the shoe.
},
{
    926.08,928.4
     You want to get a good supportive shoe.
},
{
    928.4,930.64
     See how I can't bend that?
},
{
    930.64,931.64
     Only in the toes.
},
{
    931.64,933.4
     And see how you have a stiff back?
},
{
    933.4,937.0
     You want a lace up ankle brace, or at least some taping,
},
{
    937.0,939.8
     and you want a great orthotic.
},
{
    939.8,941.5
     Why a great orthotic?
},
{
    941.5,942.78
     Let me show you this.
},
{
    942.78,944.88
     When you land normally, see what happens?
},
{
    944.88,949.68
     You're twisting through the ankle. But watch this, with an orthotic. Let me show you this. When you land normally, see what happens? You're twisting through the ankle. But watch this. With an orthotic, look it.
},
{
    949.68,954.44
     I'm pushing down. Nothing's bending. But look it. Without the orthotic. It's a lot
},
{
    954.44,959.48
     more strain. Your ankle really has to flex its muscles to support you. So a good
},
{
    959.48,966.0
     shoe, a good brace, a good insole. I love that trifecta. It lets you get out of the boot earlier.
},
{
    966.0,969.4
     Always stretch, always make sure nothing's tight,
},
{
    969.4,972.32
     always make sure you're healed up and it's safe to go.
},
{
    972.32,974.56
     The real key is, it doesn't matter what you do
},
{
    974.56,976.76
     at the beginning, we all kind of heal at the same rate.
},
{
    976.76,978.8
     The key is what you do during the second,
},
{
    978.8,980.36
     third, fourth months.
},
{
    980.36,983.2
     You have to stretch, you have to keep up your muscle strength.
},
{
    983.2,985.52
     You have to do upper body exercises.
},
{
    985.52,986.64
     That can really help.
},
{
    986.64,987.76
     That's really the key.
},
{
    987.76,989.36
     You can still work out.
},
{
    989.36,993.4
     There's a million YouTube videos showing how to work out without putting weight on your
},
{
    993.4,994.4
     foot.
},
{
    994.4,996.4
     That means upper body exercises.
},
{
    996.4,1001.24
     You can do a million things, lifting a book in front of you, tricep extensions, shoulder
},
{
    1001.24,1002.24
     lifts.
},
{
    1002.24,1005.0
     You know, you can even get a great cardio working just upper body
},
{
    1008.72,1011.96
     Or there's even Pilates that help you keep weight off your foot. Just be safe If that helped check out some of these videos and subscribe
