    0.0,6.32
     Hey everybody, it's Doctor Jo and Wonder Woman Burrito Callie. And today I'm going to show you
},
{
    6.32,13.04
     upper body dynamics. This is the third video in my 10-day whole body wellness challenge,
},
{
    13.04,17.68
     the moderate version. If you'd like to find out more about it, stick around to the end. So let's
},
{
    17.68,28.6
     get started. Disclamer alert, disclaimer alert. For the upper body dynamics you don't need any extra
},
{
    28.6,31.84
     equipment. So I'm gonna go ahead and get started with the warm-up and it's gonna
},
{
    31.84,37.16
     be a two-minute warm-up. So let's just start with some shoulder circles going
},
{
    37.16,41.36
     forwards and backwards or clockwise and counterclockwise. So with dynamic
},
{
    41.36,45.28
     movements this is more of you're moving the whole time.
},
{
    45.28,50.16
     You're kind of going with controlled speed to get that movement.
},
{
    50.16,54.24
     So you're not just static staying in one spot, like doing a stretch, but
},
{
    54.24,59.8
     you're dynamically moving the body to get it nice and warmed up and get it moving.
},
{
    59.8,63.08
     So with these, again, go at your own pace.
},
{
    63.08,64.96
     Let's do some arm stuff now.
},
{
    64.96,65.04
     We're gonna do some arm stuff now.
},
{
    65.04,68.24
     We're gonna do 30 second little block.
},
{
    68.24,71.9
     So you go as fast or slow as you comfortably can with those.
},
{
    71.9,74.38
     We'll take a little short break in between those.
},
{
    74.38,76.8
     And then when we go to the next exercise,
},
{
    76.8,79.7
     we'll take a little longer break.
},
{
    79.7,82.38
     So we can get ready in the position
},
{
    82.38,84.86
     and just kind of reset our muscles.
},
{
    84.86,85.22
     So again
},
{
    85.22,89.56
     with dynamics you don't want them to be jerky movements, you want them to be
},
{
    89.56,94.78
     smooth movements but a little bit quicker so your heart's gonna get going a
},
{
    94.78,98.56
     little bit more. You're gonna be moving a little bit more with some of these so
},
{
    98.56,102.16
     again if you need to take a break or if you need to stop in between the
},
{
    102.16,109.28
     movement time feel free to do that. So now let's just do some shoulder squeezes, kind of to get the chest opened up a
},
{
    109.28,114.24
     little bit because we're going to do some trunk things as well. Just kind of, again
},
{
    114.24,118.72
     now this is just the warm-up so we're kind of not doing any holds and we're
},
{
    118.72,122.52
     going through and that's kind of how the dynamic is too. You're not really holding
},
{
    122.52,130.28
     the movement, you're moving the whole time dynamically. So that's kind of how that goes. And then for the rest of the
},
{
    130.28,135.88
     warm-up just doing a little kind of seated trunk rotation just to get again
},
{
    135.88,142.08
     all those movements in the upper body to get those muscles going as well. We'll
},
{
    142.08,145.22
     start off sitting down with the upper body movements and then
},
{
    145.22,155.06
     we'll stand up as we get going along. So the first one is just going to be seated
},
{
    155.06,159.34
     T's and so it's kind of like it sounds you're going to be making a T movement
},
{
    159.34,163.66
     with your arms out in front of you. So again if your shoulders get tired as you
},
{
    163.66,168.98
     go along take a little break in between you don't have to do it the whole time but if you want
},
{
    168.98,171.76
     to try and do it the whole time you can go maybe go a little bit slower if
},
{
    171.76,176.82
     you're getting tired. So a T just opening up you don't have to go too much
},
{
    176.82,181.58
     further back besides just the plane of your body but you're just going out and
},
{
    181.58,185.76
     just making those nice smooth movements. No real pause you know this is not a static stretch we're not holding it anywhere but we're just going out in it, just making those nice, smooth movements. No real pause. You know,
},
{
    185.76,190.4
     this is not a static stretch. We're not holding it anywhere, but we're just kind of getting these
},
{
    190.4,195.92
     movements here. If this is a little uncomfortable for your shoulders, if you want to bring the
},
{
    195.92,201.52
     T down just a little bit, that's okay. You can modify it some, but try and bring it back up
},
{
    202.08,207.04
     as you go. So if you've already watched this a couple times and you
},
{
    207.04,212.88
     know what to do and you just want to follow along, you can put the mute button on and put on some of
},
{
    212.88,216.16
     your own music because you know I'm going to be talking throughout the whole thing so I can show
},
{
    216.16,220.64
     you some modifications and everything. So if you want to listen to your own music because you feel
},
{
    220.64,225.04
     like you've got it down, that's fine. Just making sure that it's a controlled
},
{
    225.04,230.88
     movement so it's not so fast that it's jerky where I'm making the muscles uncomfortable.
},
{
    232.32,236.88
     And again, if I want to take it down just a little bit, I can do that as well.
},
{
    242.96,246.84
     So the next one is going to be with our arms up over our head.
},
{
    246.84,249.24
     And then we're just going to kind of do a side to side movement.
},
{
    249.24,255.0
     We're going to do some extra sets of these just because we're kind of going side to side,
},
{
    255.0,259.7
     but we'll go alternating back and forth instead of just going to one side and then changing.
},
{
    259.7,262.62
     So we'll get a couple extra in.
},
{
    262.62,267.84
     So just arms up over to one side, over to the other side.
},
{
    267.84,271.64
     You can see I kind of like to follow with my eyes and my head.
},
{
    271.64,276.0
     That just kind of helps with the whole upper body dynamic movement.
},
{
    276.0,279.04
     You can see I'm not going over super far.
},
{
    279.04,283.2
     If you want to get a little bit more of a stretch over there, you can.
},
{
    283.2,285.68
     But again, remember you're not really holding it
},
{
    285.68,291.68
     you're getting that movement side to side going back and forth and again if you feel like you have
},
{
    291.68,297.04
     to take a little break in between if holding your arms up for that long period is really tiring
},
{
    297.04,301.68
     make sure and stop in between you'll feel like you have to push all the way through or you can go
},
{
    301.68,311.64
     a little bit slower you know as long as you're keeping it that continuous motion you can slow it down just a little bit and then work
},
{
    311.64,319.68
     on picking up that speed a little bit later on. So just again kind of keeping
},
{
    319.68,326.64
     in that same plane of your body on the side. We'll go into a little more rotation next.
},
{
    334.72,338.96
     And again, we'll do a couple more sets of those just because it is an alternating back and forth
},
{
    338.96,346.96
     side. So back up. And then again, if you don't feel like you can go all the way over and you want to make
},
{
    346.96,351.16
     the movement shorter, you can definitely make it shorter.
},
{
    351.16,353.48
     Just still make that continuous motion.
},
{
    353.48,357.44
     So you're not going and holding this time because it's dynamic.
},
{
    357.44,360.44
     You're continuously going back and forth.
},
{
    360.44,365.08
     If this is still a lot on your shoulders and you feel like this is just really tiring,
},
{
    365.08,367.56
     then bring down your arms a little bit.
},
{
    367.56,368.68
     Bend the elbows.
},
{
    368.68,373.72
     It won't be quite the same movement, but it'll be just enough modification where it's something
},
{
    373.72,377.0
     that you can do because these, you want to be able to do them, you want to be able to
},
{
    377.0,380.24
     accomplish them even though this is the moderate level.
},
{
    380.24,382.96
     You still want to be able to accomplish the movements.
},
{
    382.96,391.04
     So again, if you need to kind of bend your elbows and still go side to side, that sometimes is a little bit better on the shoulders
},
{
    391.04,396.8
     if maybe you've got, you know, a little tendonitis issue or an impingement issue.
},
{
    396.8,412.72
     This might be a little bit more comfortable than the bringing it up and over.
},
{
    415.32,417.52
     So now we're going to go into that rotation a little bit. So we're just going to start up,
},
{
    417.52,419.92
     and then we're going to rotate our arms down.
},
{
    419.92,421.68
     So same thing, we're going to alternate
},
{
    421.68,423.44
     throughout the 30 seconds.
},
{
    423.44,425.32
     So we'll do a couple more sets of these
},
{
    425.32,427.64
     just because it is both sides,
},
{
    427.64,429.28
     even though we're doing both sides
},
{
    429.28,431.36
     throughout the whole movement.
},
{
    431.36,434.02
     So arms are gonna come up,
},
{
    434.02,436.42
     and then you're rotating down,
},
{
    436.42,437.38
     and then coming back up.
},
{
    437.38,441.08
     So again, you can see I'm following everything
},
{
    441.08,443.52
     with my eyes and my head,
},
{
    443.52,448.4
     just to get that whole movement in there. If your neck is
},
{
    448.4,454.32
     getting a little tired with it, you don't necessarily have to do it. You can just move more your eyes
},
{
    454.32,460.32
     in your head, but this is really to get that whole rotation. So you want to move your trunk and your
},
{
    460.32,465.84
     head at the same time as you go making that movement in there.
},
{
    468.4,473.8
     And then again, if you need to stop and take a breath, if you need to do the 30 seconds now, you're just taking a breath, that's okay.
},
{
    473.84,476.52
     You just again, go at your own pace.
},
{
    476.52,478.28
     Don't try and wear yourself out too much,
},
{
    478.28,481.4
     especially if you haven't been doing a whole lot,
},
{
    482.12,484.76
     maybe sitting at home a lot in front of the computer.
},
{
    485.44,489.16
     Same thing here. If you feel like this is whole lot, maybe sitting at home a lot in front of the computer. Same thing here, if you feel like this is a lot,
},
{
    489.16,492.36
     you can just kind of shorten the movement,
},
{
    492.36,494.28
     still get that rotation,
},
{
    494.28,496.96
     but you're not going all the way down.
},
{
    496.96,498.28
     So sometimes that's a little better.
},
{
    498.28,500.0
     Maybe if you have some back issues
},
{
    500.0,503.28
     and it's uncomfortable to twist that far,
},
{
    503.28,505.44
     you could also, again, with this one,
},
{
    505.44,506.96
     bend your elbows a little bit
},
{
    506.96,508.92
     to take some pressure off of the shoulders.
},
{
    508.92,510.32
     So I'll show you with this one
},
{
    510.32,512.42
     instead of bringing your arms all the way up.
},
{
    512.42,514.04
     Maybe have them here,
},
{
    514.04,518.8
     and I'm still rotating and bringing them down,
},
{
    518.8,520.52
     but I'm keeping my elbows bent
},
{
    520.52,523.36
     and not bringing my arms as high up,
},
{
    523.36,525.92
     because sometimes that's what causes that stress on the
},
{
    525.92,531.36
     shoulders. So again, if you feel anything that's starting to get into that pain range and not just
},
{
    531.36,538.16
     tired and fatigue, either modify it or just go ahead and take that extra break and skip those for a
},
{
    538.16,545.36
     little bit. And so again, I'll do the full ones this time.
},
{
    545.36,549.48
     And again, you can go slower and just do a couple at a time.
},
{
    549.48,552.48
     You don't have to go as fast as I'm going.
},
{
    552.48,559.58
     But eventually you want to be able to make it a pretty smooth motion coming up and down.
},
{
    559.58,569.6
     But if you need to kind of pause, reset, come up, pause again. You can definitely do that in pausing
},
{
    569.6,577.76
     and resetting each time, just getting that nice motion in there. Or pause a little bit
},
{
    577.76,589.04
     lower and then come back. So now we're going to go into some standing stuff. So just kind of getting in
},
{
    589.04,594.88
     a comfortable position. Now we're just going to do some trunk rotation. So with your arms, you can
},
{
    594.88,605.6
     kind of put them where you want to. Sometimes I'll just use them like to bring my body around to give it an extra, I'm just kind of twisting this way.
},
{
    606.36,610.8
     If you want to have your arms down and you're really just
},
{
    611.4,615.56
     using your trunk to do rotations, that's fine as well.
},
{
    616.48,623.64
     You might feel a little pop while you're doing this in your back, your upper back, or even in your shoulders or your neck area.
},
{
    623.72,625.04
     That's okay.
},
{
    625.04,626.72
     A lot of times that's just your body
},
{
    626.72,628.64
     either adjusting a little bit
},
{
    628.64,631.68
     or it's the fluids moving in your joints.
},
{
    631.68,634.76
     I know a lot of people like to argue which one it is,
},
{
    634.76,636.6
     but I think there's times where it actually
},
{
    636.6,640.76
     might be one versus the other, but I think both do happen.
},
{
    640.76,643.24
     So again, you can use your arms a little bit
},
{
    643.24,646.2
     with this one doing, you know, if I get my
},
{
    646.2,650.56
     arms into it, I'm getting a nice bigger rotation.
},
{
    650.56,651.92
     I feel that stretch in there.
},
{
    651.92,656.64
     But you can see if you look at my knees when I rotate over, I'm bending, I'm unlocking
},
{
    656.64,659.96
     them just a little bit to get that extra stretch in there.
},
{
    659.96,666.0
     And then especially if you have some knee issues, unlocking those knees really help as well,
},
{
    666.0,670.12
     just to kind of get that nice movement in there.
},
{
    670.12,676.2
     But you can see again, this is a continuous movement side to side.
},
{
    676.2,678.2
     I'm not stopping and holding that stretch.
},
{
    678.2,680.08
     That's more of a static stretch.
},
{
    680.08,682.16
     This is that dynamic movement.
},
{
    682.16,683.8
     Get your heart flowing.
},
{
    683.8,686.32
     You might hear me getting a little bit out of breath.
},
{
    686.32,689.12
     And it's not that these are big, crazy movements,
},
{
    689.12,690.96
     but I'm talking through the exercises.
},
{
    690.96,693.56
     So that does make it a little bit harder.
},
{
    693.56,697.92
     But again, you're just breathing through these exercises
},
{
    697.92,699.24
     and going at your own pace.
},
{
    699.24,703.2
     So even if you have to kind of, again, stop here,
},
{
    703.2,706.48
     and then go and maybe do a little pause. You know, ideally
},
{
    706.48,710.6
     you want to be moving the whole time with the dynamics, but go at your own pace and
},
{
    710.6,716.6
     make sure that you feel comfortable. And then for the next one, if you don't want to use
},
{
    716.6,720.52
     your arms at all, you know, maybe your your shoulders have gotten tired out a little bit.
},
{
    720.52,726.88
     So now I'm just going to move my body kind of just going like this, even though it might
},
{
    726.88,731.04
     look kind of kind of funny, but it's like, you know, you're just turning around looking behind you,
},
{
    731.04,737.2
     making sure nobody's sneaking up on you. So again, and you can see I'm still kind of unlocking those
},
{
    737.2,745.2
     knees just a little bit when I'm turning to make sure that I'm kind of protecting all those joints that are getting the movement in there.
},
{
    752.32,758.32
     So the next one is just going to be a modified jumping jack. If you've done this a couple times and you want to go into the full
},
{
    758.32,764.68
     jumping jack movement, that's great. Feel free to. But this is really just a modified jumping jacks are a lot harder than they seem.
},
{
    769.32,774.48
     So this is just a way to modify it where you're really still getting that upper body movement. But it's just kind of adding a leg kick out while you do it. So you know mainly just kind of stepping
},
{
    774.48,779.96
     out. Don't want to step on my phone. But just kind of reaching that foot out as you go. So for this
},
{
    779.96,788.0
     one it's still the upper body is what you're working on. So I would think more about your arms than your legs.
},
{
    788.0,791.04
     This is maybe challenging for your balance.
},
{
    791.04,795.96
     If you have some balance issues, you can just stand in one place and do it.
},
{
    795.96,798.28
     And you can see I'm keeping my elbows bent for this.
},
{
    798.28,803.12
     If you want to open your arms all the way up and do that, you certainly can.
},
{
    803.12,806.96
     But I find that keeping those elbows bent a little bit just makes it more comfortable
},
{
    806.96,811.56
     on the shoulders. But if you want to make big huge movements with your arms, if that's
},
{
    811.56,818.12
     comfortable for you, really swinging them up to get that dynamic movement, that's fine.
},
{
    818.12,821.4
     You can definitely do that. And you can see I'm kind of turning my head to the side. I'm
},
{
    821.4,825.84
     kicking the leg out. And again,'s getting you know helping with a dynamic
},
{
    825.84,831.44
     movement for the whole upper body so your neck is getting involved as well and again those neck
},
{
    831.44,837.6
     muscles and those shoulder muscles are usually the same muscles just connecting on different ends
},
{
    837.6,848.6
     so it's nice to kind of get that movement going at the same time again, go at your own pace. If this is a little tiring for you,
},
{
    848.6,856.2
     take a little break in between. Take one of the 30 seconds. How go a little bit slower,
},
{
    856.2,873.82
     still making those movements, but maybe not quite as fast. Even if you have to stop in between shake it out come up again take a little
},
{
    873.82,879.98
     break that's fine too if you want to even do the arms a little bit lower so
},
{
    879.98,885.2
     you're still just making the movement but not going into that bigger movement
},
{
    885.2,889.2
     again where it might really either tire out the shoulders, might be uncomfortable
},
{
    889.2,893.72
     for the shoulders, you can definitely modify it again by going just a little
},
{
    893.72,904.28
     bit, just kind of bringing you know them up into that stop sign position. And
},
{
    904.28,909.0
     again if you don't want to even do the legs, you can just kind of start off with
},
{
    909.0,922.88
     this motion, getting everything going, and then kind of working your way from there.
},
{
    922.88,925.2
     So the next one can be done standing or sitting.
},
{
    925.2,929.96
     I'm actually going to sit down to do it, but it's up to you if you wanted to just continue
},
{
    929.96,931.84
     to do it standing, you can.
},
{
    931.84,936.44
     So this one is going to be kind of like the T. This time you're actually crossing your
},
{
    936.44,937.54
     arms across your body.
},
{
    937.54,942.46
     So it's almost like you're giving yourself a hug, but in a dynamic way.
},
{
    942.46,949.6
     So you're coming in and all the way across. As you can see, I'm alternating
},
{
    949.6,955.92
     which arm goes on top. You don't necessarily have to, but definitely, you know, change it up some.
},
{
    955.92,960.64
     You don't have to do it every time, but it makes a difference of that stretch that you're getting in
},
{
    960.64,965.4
     the shoulder. So really kind of opening back up and closing in.
},
{
    965.4,968.14
     So almost giving yourself the hug,
},
{
    968.14,971.28
     but you're not staying long enough to really hug in there,
},
{
    971.28,972.62
     getting that movement.
},
{
    973.76,976.8
     And again, this is one where if having them all the way up
},
{
    976.8,981.2
     at that 90 degree level, you can go a little bit lower.
},
{
    981.2,988.56
     So this time I'll kind of almost going in a downwards position. Eventually you want to
},
{
    988.56,994.72
     bring it all the way up, but again this is a way to modify it so you're still doing some movements
},
{
    996.0,1001.6
     but not quite going high up where you might really get tired or fatigue your arms out.
},
{
    1001.6,1008.28
     So there's always a way to modify something so if you don't feel like you can do something always check in with your physical therapist because they can's always a way to modify something. So if you don't feel like you can do something, always check in with your physical therapist because they
},
{
    1008.28,1013.56
     can show you some ways to modify it, even if you just go see them for one session. And
},
{
    1013.56,1017.72
     again, you know, make sure you're nice and relaxed and doing it, taking a little break
},
{
    1017.72,1027.2
     in between letting those muscles reset a little bit. Even if you have to go not all the way back out so maybe I'm just
},
{
    1027.2,1032.12
     kind of crossing out in front of me so I'm doing this movement. Again this is
},
{
    1032.12,1037.94
     kind of a way to modify it. If opening up is either really tiring or maybe
},
{
    1037.94,1043.2
     uncomfortable right now you can really just kind of cross them in front of you
},
{
    1043.2,1046.08
     again. This is really just to get you moving,
},
{
    1046.96,1054.4
     get you not just sitting in one spot all day. So a modification is really just as good as
},
{
    1055.52,1059.44
     you know doing the full movement because we just want to get you moving. That's the main thing.
},
{
    1059.44,1064.32
     You might not be sweating by the end but you'll definitely go, yeah I'm glad that I
},
{
    1064.32,1065.04
     did some kind of
},
{
    1065.04,1069.08
     movements because I feel better and I feel a little bit looser and not so tight.
},
{
    1069.08,1075.64
     But eventually if you can, you really want to open your arms back up and really kind
},
{
    1075.64,1080.76
     of, even if you want to touch your shoulders when you come in each way if you've got that
},
{
    1080.76,1089.6
     much flexibility in your shoulders, really to kind of get that extra push at the end but again you're not really holding it there just
},
{
    1089.6,1096.36
     a really quick pause. So the next one is going to be a little bit of the jumping
},
{
    1096.36,1099.6
     jack movement again with our arms but this time I want you to really do some
},
{
    1099.6,1104.52
     deep breathing some chest breathing opening up the chest really coming up
},
{
    1104.52,1106.72
     and trying to lengthen that spine.
},
{
    1106.72,1110.18
     So this is going to be deep breathing with a movement.
},
{
    1110.18,1112.64
     So it might be a little bit slower.
},
{
    1112.64,1122.36
     So I'm breathing in and breathing out.
},
{
    1122.36,1126.96
     You can breathe out with your blowing out through your mouth or blowing out through
},
{
    1126.96,1129.56
     your nose, whichever one you like.
},
{
    1129.56,1132.24
     It depends on how tired I am at the end.
},
{
    1132.24,1135.8
     If I'm feeling a little tired, sometimes I like to breathe out through my mouth, kind
},
{
    1135.8,1139.08
     of with my lips pursed a little bit.
},
{
    1139.08,1142.68
     But if not, you can just comfortably breathe in.
},
{
    1142.68,1146.8
     But when you breathe in, really take in that air and just
},
{
    1146.8,1151.84
     try and lengthen that spine when you come up. So I won't talk as much with the next couple ones.
},
{
    1171.48,1179.08
     So, again, a way to modify this is if this is uncomfortable going all the way up, still breathe, but not bringing your arms all the way up and over.
},
{
    1179.08,1183.9
     Eventually, you want to get there.
},
{
    1183.9,1188.44
     You want to get all the way up and over, but if you feel like that's a little bit too much
},
{
    1188.44,1192.48
     for your shoulders, you've been doing a lot already, again there's ways to modify it.
},
{
    1192.48,1198.18
     So you can even bend your elbows and do it.
},
{
    1198.18,1223.96
     Still getting that breathing in there. Kind of almost bringing your head down with your arms too, but eventually.
},
{
    1223.96,1225.92
     And then relaxing and taking a breath.
},
{
    1225.92,1228.44
     So and you can go super slow.
},
{
    1228.44,1233.12
     I'm continuously going through it, but even if you want to slow it down a little bit.
},
{
    1233.12,1241.12
     So
},
{
    1241.12,1245.0
     so you can take that nice deep breath. I'm gonna breathe out through my mouth this time.
},
{
    1259.0,1264.0
     So very different ways to be able to modify that. So there you have it. Those were upper body dynamics.
