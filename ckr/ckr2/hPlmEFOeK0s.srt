     Bob and Brad, the two most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    8.64,12.08
     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist and I'm Brad Heineck physical therapist
},
{
    12.08,15.42
     Together we are the most famous physical therapists on the internet in our opinion of course Bob
},
{
    15.42,18.92
     Brad today we're gonna talk about what is causing your shoulder pain you're getting this shoulder pain
},
{
    18.92,23.08
     You're upset about it. We're gonna show you some tests you can try on your own right
},
{
    23.08,25.76
     This is to yourself little self-assessment here
},
{
    25.76,28.16
     You know eventually you're going to probably need to see the doctor
},
{
    28.16,33.36
     But this maybe gives you a little leadway into it so that you can say to your doctor
},
{
    34.16,36.64
     I wonder if it's this, right, they love that don't they Brad?
},
{
    38.24,42.16
     Another one of those basis. All right, we have 10 and most important is number seven
},
{
    42.16,46.26
     So you better stick around till number seven, right because it's in our opinion the most common
},
{
    46.26,51.52
     All right number one is a rediculopathy. What does that mean Brad? These big words. It's ridiculous
},
{
    52.8,57.48
     Beans that you're getting some pain down your arm from your neck probably a pinched nerve in your neck
},
{
    57.48,62.94
     Sure, and one of the easy tests you can do for that first off you may get numbness and tingling
},
{
    62.94,66.68
     These are some of the symptoms you're going to get. All the way down into the fingers especially if it goes all the way down into the fingers
},
{
    66.68,72.12
     That's when you're starting to think that it might be this sort of thing right so what you're gonna do is you're gonna turn your neck
},
{
    73.0,77.88
     To the side that you're having pain turn and extend and then you're gonna push down
},
{
    78.44,83.98
     It'd be better if somebody else would actually do it right so I turn extend and then push down gently
},
{
    84.36,87.76
     Now if that recreates your symptoms that means you're pinching that nerve
},
{
    87.76,92.24
     And that means you could possibly have a problem with your neck that's giving you a shoulder pain
},
{
    92.24,95.78
     Right, and then you better probably go in and have a look that for sure
},
{
    95.78,99.96
     Yeah, you can do the other side to rotate extend and then push down
},
{
    99.96,106.04
     And it doesn't take much pressure and if this is it it usually triggers it. It's pretty clear. It's like oh now
},
{
    106.04,110.56
     It's getting worse not good nerve pain hurts. Yeah, nerve pain is some of the worst pain you're gonna get
},
{
    111.12,114.5
     Second one is thoracic outlets syndrome and in this case
},
{
    114.5,121.44
     You're getting some pinching up here in the neck and the shoulder in here some of the muscles or maybe over the first rib
},
{
    121.6,125.0
     Somewhere in here simple tests called It's called roost test
},
{
    129.82,130.32
     R-O-O-S gonna bring your arms up 90 degrees here 90 at the elbow
},
{
    135.66,138.92
     Yep stop and usually bring it back a little bit too bad. That's right back and then you're gonna just
},
{
    143.8,148.88
     There's people that don't know what they're talking about chicken dance, you know this song right anyway I've seen different, you know, what you're looking to see if it starts recreating your symptoms
},
{
    148.88,152.62
     Right. They say to do it, some say to do it up for three minutes
},
{
    152.62,156.52
     You know some say a couple minutes. I'm thinking three minutes is gonna get anybody's answer
},
{
    156.52,160.96
     Yeah, I was gonna say, so you know if they start showing up after about 20 seconds to a minute
},
{
    160.96,165.68
     I think it is a good possibility that that's playing a role. Sure. All right number three
},
{
    166.24,173.68
     Rotator cuff tear, okay a rotator cuff. Could it even be a rotator cuff tendonitis or kind of a
},
{
    174.64,177.36
     injury of the muscles of the rotator cuff to them?
},
{
    177.6,180.56
     I just want to say one thing on this if you try to lift your shoulder
},
{
    181.28,183.76
     And you're going like this is all the higher you can get it
},
{
    185.32,190.32
     That's making me think maybe it's a tear you know by the way Brad if you haven't
},
{
    190.32,193.68
     already if you're new to our channel please take a second just to subscribe
},
{
    193.68,196.96
     we got a button right over here right there he's wondering I was pointing at him
},
{
    196.96,201.52
     and we provide videos on how to stay healthy fit pain-free and we upload
},
{
    201.52,205.4
     every day right so there's a lot of head to
},
{
    205.4,208.64
     toe we work. All right next one so we're talking about the rotator cuff tear
},
{
    208.64,213.16
     brad, there's a couple ways to test that because there's the rotator cuff is
},
{
    213.16,216.78
     for muscles so we want to make sure we're testing them to see what their
},
{
    216.78,220.24
     strength is like. You actually tore the tendon of the muscle not the muscle you
},
{
    220.24,223.68
     tore the tendon and one of the ways to test that is if you're facing there
},
{
    223.68,228.04
     brad you're gonna bring the arm out to the a little bit forward, right?
},
{
    228.04,232.72
     30 degrees up about 80 degrees and then you're gonna turn the thumb down, right?
},
{
    232.72,237.8
     And you're just gonna give a little push here. Now if it's if it's tore it's gonna just give way.
},
{
    237.8,240.92
     Yeah, it's probably gonna be you may not even be able to give it to you.
},
{
    240.92,243.84
     Yeah, you may not even be able to put it up in this position.
},
{
    243.84,248.0
     Right or it's painful there You can test yourself like that.
},
{
    248.0,254.0
     Now a lot of these rotator cuff muscles, they take some experience, but you can try them here and get a feel.
},
{
    254.0,261.0
     The other one is you could test the infraspinatus and the teres minor, and I'm just saying that to impress you.
},
{
    261.0,266.72
     You put your hands like this, and you can actually put both in like this Brad, so I can push them both in.
},
{
    266.72,270.04
     And if one gives way, that might be a sign
},
{
    270.04,271.96
     that you have a terror.
},
{
    271.96,273.72
     This one I see a lot in the clinic.
},
{
    273.72,275.28
     I'll do this, or you could do it on yourself.
},
{
    275.28,277.52
     If you could pull here, that one's strong,
},
{
    277.52,280.36
     and this one, oh it hurts and it goes right in.
},
{
    280.36,282.12
     It's a pretty good sign, something's going on
},
{
    282.12,283.08
     in that rotator cuff.
},
{
    283.08,285.92
     Hostu arthritis, or just plain old arthritis of the shoulder
},
{
    285.92,287.68
     Not generally this is gonna be people are older
},
{
    287.68,294.34
     I mean it tends to be and if it's catching or clicking you know grinding that's kind of a sign
},
{
    294.94,300.82
     Generally with osteoarthritis you start to lose motion in the shoulder too, especially external rotation Brad
},
{
    300.82,304.94
     So if you kind of put your arms like this and like this one can go way back here
},
{
    304.94,305.12
     And this one only can go way back here
},
{
    305.12,310.64
     and this one only can go this far, now I'm rotating I'm keeping the arm at a right angle the elbow
},
{
    310.64,316.48
     right there and all the you know it's rotating like this so if this one you know only goes this
},
{
    316.48,322.08
     far but this one goes all the way there could be a sign of a little bit arthritis in there
},
{
    322.08,325.08
     that's the nice thing with all these tests is you got two shoulders
},
{
    325.48,328.4
     If they were both reasonably healthy before the injury
},
{
    329.0,335.82
     You test from one to the other and say I'm not sure if that's a good sign or bad sign test the good shoulder and see what happens
},
{
    335.82,339.88
     I'm sure you could get arthritis in both shoulders though. Right. Yeah, that is one deal
},
{
    340.04,346.0
     Okay, acromioclavicular joint. That's the AC joint, that's this joint right here
},
{
    346.28,351.56
     If you look at the collar bone as it goes along and right as it attaches to this other bone
},
{
    352.16,354.16
     Should we go a little closer Brad? Sure
},
{
    355.8,357.8
     Lonnie says stay away from her
},
{
    357.88,362.68
     Okay, going along the bone right as it attaches to this other bone. That's the joint right here
},
{
    362.68,366.48
     Yep, very common injury there if you fall on it, fall on your elbow.
},
{
    366.48,369.52
     A lot of football players have injuries in here.
},
{
    369.52,372.24
     Well, or you fall on the point of your shoulder.
},
{
    372.24,373.76
     Yeah, exactly.
},
{
    373.76,377.36
     Weightlifters get this brat a lot. A lot of people do heavy bench press.
},
{
    377.36,381.52
     Okay. This is very common in those, they wear out the end of their clavicle.
},
{
    381.52,387.76
     Very easy tests you can do. One, let's do the most simple one, you just bring your arm across like this and pull it across like
},
{
    387.76,392.56
     this. I call it the crossover test. Yeah, point pain right here, that could be
},
{
    392.56,395.6
     the cromial colivicular, it could be other things too, but right, you know we're
},
{
    395.6,399.44
     just giving you a couple tests to do. Another one, put your hand here and now
},
{
    399.44,404.32
     you're gonna push up like this. Yep, that'd be another one that could bring it
},
{
    404.32,406.56
     on. The other last one is a pull apart
},
{
    406.56,412.08
     test, you're going to pull your arms apart and actually feel that a little bit on this one, so
},
{
    412.08,419.52
     you're going to one shoulder will be painful or the problem will be, yeah I'm a little bit positive
},
{
    419.52,426.44
     on here, just a slight ac, which is a good point Bob you may be positive on some of these tests and it may not be
},
{
    427.4,433.4
     Positive, positive means that it's you actually found a result. It's not positive. It's not good, right? So
},
{
    434.24,436.24
     Burst site is number six
},
{
    436.76,440.76
     Kind of a tough one to test for isn't it Brad? It tends to be very localized pain
},
{
    441.0,446.12
     You know, it's not spreading out going down. You you know It's the burst is a fluid filled sack here
},
{
    446.44,449.7
     So you might have a little inflammation here even it might feel warm
},
{
    449.7,452.68
     It might even be swollen and you can push on it
},
{
    452.68,457.64
     I used to test it Brad kind of bringing the arm back like that that exposes the burst a little bit and then I
},
{
    457.8,462.74
     You know I press on it and again you could have tendonitis, burstitis
},
{
    462.74,467.84
     They can they present similar you can have both, very very common to have both actually
},
{
    467.84,469.12
     So
},
{
    469.12,473.56
     Impingement now this is number seven. This is the one that's the most important because number one
},
{
    473.64,478.64
     We see this the most often by far and basically what's happening is your shoulders
},
{
    478.64,482.84
     You know forward a little bit and it's pinching on the tendons in there, right?
},
{
    482.84,485.66
     Which can lead to tendonitis which can lead to tendonitis, which can lead
},
{
    485.66,487.72
     to a rotator cuff tear.
},
{
    487.72,492.4
     So this is the one that, by the way, I'll have to link up maybe one of our videos on
},
{
    492.4,498.28
     how to treat impingement, because if I were to take a guess if you're having shoulder pain,
},
{
    498.28,501.32
     this probably is playing a role.
},
{
    501.32,505.84
     So one simple test that you can do on your own is you put the arm here again
},
{
    505.84,510.88
     But this time just bring the elbow up like this and if that hurts it gives you a little bit of pinching
},
{
    510.88,512.88
     So you're lifting with the other arm?
},
{
    512.88,515.0
     Yep, keep this one planted on there
},
{
    515.2,520.3
     So you're getting the acromium and the humerus to come in and pinch and that's where it gets the name impingement
},
{
    520.3,527.34
     Because you're internally rotating so it's pinching those tendons and so so that's the again the most important one number eight
},
{
    527.72,533.1
     Which leads to tendonitis which we talk you know this can lead to tendonitis the impingement
},
{
    533.1,539.34
     Yeah, so usually what we see with this Brad is like a painful arc we call right see this a lot
},
{
    539.34,542.42
     Yeah, so like here from here to here it doesn't hurt
},
{
    542.7,548.7
     But you know from here to here out because it's pinching and it's pinching on that tendon, right?
},
{
    548.7,553.44
     And sometimes it's kind of interesting where here to here it's fine and then
},
{
    553.44,557.16
     how it hurts and then they get through that and then up here it's fine again
},
{
    557.16,559.16
     Because the tendon clears, right?
},
{
    559.16,563.1
     That part of the tendon that has the tendonitis actually clears
},
{
    563.24,569.36
     That's a really good sign of tendonitis is if it hurts in a painful arc and then doesn't. Right. It's probably
},
{
    569.36,572.32
     one of the few things that does that, wouldn't you think, Brad? Yeah, it's kind
},
{
    572.32,575.88
     of interesting but we don't want to get in the mechanics of it now but you know
},
{
    575.88,579.88
     maybe we'll in another video. Number nine, if you have an unstable shoulder. Now if
},
{
    579.88,585.32
     you if you tend to have be double-j in other joints, like say you can take your thumb
},
{
    585.32,586.8
     and put it down to your forearm.
},
{
    586.8,588.04
     Yeah.
},
{
    588.04,588.88
     Elbows hyperextended.
},
{
    588.88,591.08
     Yeah, your elbows are hyperextended
},
{
    591.08,593.16
     or your knees are hyperextended.
},
{
    593.16,595.44
     There's a good chance that you might have
},
{
    595.44,597.24
     an unstable shoulder because that means
},
{
    597.24,599.0
     your shoulder's not stable either.
},
{
    599.0,600.8
     And we do the apprehensive test,
},
{
    600.8,603.32
     which not a really easy one to do on your own probably,
},
{
    603.32,606.48
     but we bring it like this and we go like this.
},
{
    606.48,610.24
     So if I do it on Brad and I would push it this way,
},
{
    610.24,612.9
     he gets apprehensive about it because he's worried
},
{
    612.9,614.92
     it's gonna even pop out of the joint.
},
{
    614.92,617.06
     Yeah, so in other words, there's no pain,
},
{
    617.06,620.28
     but it's like you're just really afraid it's gonna go.
},
{
    620.28,622.28
     You don't like it being up in this position.
},
{
    622.28,628.44
     So you can have an unstable shoulder without that being a problem, but it's moving around too much
},
{
    628.44,630.44
     It's sloshing around and giving you problems
},
{
    631.04,633.04
     Number 10 is fibromyalgia
},
{
    634.04,640.52
     Difficult one to diagnose even doctors have trouble diagnosing this. Really often go kind of go by symptoms
},
{
    640.52,644.32
     You know are you tired? Do you have a lot of trigger points? That's part of the main thing
},
{
    644.32,648.56
     They have specific ones mapped out for people that are consistent with fibromyalgia.
},
{
    649.52,653.52
     We're not going to get into that, it's something that you know, may be hard.
},
{
    653.52,656.96
     It could be a possibility, right, if you're having pain in other areas besides your shoulder,
},
{
    656.96,662.88
     that's something to think about. So we hope that was helpful and remember Brad and I can fix just
},
{
    662.88,665.7
     about anything except that broken heart
},
{
    665.7,670.08
     I like the way you make that come in Bob. Yeah, I think I'm gonna put it over your head this face
},
{
    670.08,673.98
     Right down open it up. All right. Thanks for watching
},
