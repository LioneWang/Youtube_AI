    0.0,3.6
     Today we're going over the pinky toe right here.
},
{
    3.6,9.0
     Is this toe broken? Is it sprained? We're going to go over how to take care of it,
},
{
    9.0,13.74
     how to diagnose it, and when to panic and see your doctor. And we're starting
},
{
    13.74,16.44
     right now.
},
{
    18.44,24.6
     So the real key is how do you tell if it's broken or sprained? So number one, if
},
{
    24.6,27.16
     it's black, blue, it's more
},
{
    27.16,32.72
     likely to be broken, although it's not 100%. If it's deformed, so if your toes like bent
},
{
    32.72,39.38
     like this right here, very likely there's a good chance that it's broken. Number two,
},
{
    39.38,45.56
     if it's open, that's an emergency. You have to see your podiatrist at that point.
},
{
    45.56,49.48
     As you can see right here, there's a lot of nerves on top of your foot.
},
{
    49.48,57.76
     If you're having severe numbness, burning, tingling, spasms at night, if they onset rapidly,
},
{
    57.76,61.08
     that might mean you might have some type of nerve injury.
},
{
    61.08,63.24
     You probably want to see your doctor.
},
{
    63.24,66.4
     It might be a blood flow injury at the same time.
},
{
    66.4,70.0
     Sometimes it's a blood clot, not a broken toe for some people, although young healthy
},
{
    70.0,72.08
     people that's very unlikely.
},
{
    72.08,78.08
     So if you break your fifth toe right here, it's going to be black and bruised and swollen.
},
{
    78.08,88.08
     The only 100% way to know for sure if it's broken or sprained is to get an X-ray. But generally, a deformity, a black-blue swelling,
},
{
    89.16,91.84
     a really aching throb that doesn't get better
},
{
    91.84,95.56
     after a day or two means that it is broken.
},
{
    95.56,98.36
     That sharp shooting tingling pain
},
{
    98.36,100.4
     is due to these nerves right here.
},
{
    100.4,104.02
     So you can see that there's nerves running across here.
},
{
    104.02,105.76
     That's gonna create that shooting and zapping. So as can see that there's nerves running across here. That's going to create that shooting
},
{
    105.76,111.2
     and zapping. So as that toe is swollen, that's what causes those pain and symptoms. So you
},
{
    111.2,117.28
     can see there's a lot of tendons. Here's the actual joint right here. And then you have your actual
},
{
    117.28,128.28
     toe right here. So the problem is you want to stop it from rubbing and bumping against your foot, and you also want to stop it from bending like this.
},
{
    128.28,131.52
     So you can see that's what's gonna cause you your pain,
},
{
    131.52,135.52
     is when that toe is bending like this.
},
{
    135.52,138.92
     So what you can do is, number one,
},
{
    138.92,140.84
     you can see there's these gel pads
},
{
    140.84,143.34
     that can slip on the toe.
},
{
    143.34,146.28
     So the easiest thing right here, this will help.
},
{
    146.28,151.28
     It's not perfect, but you can see the gel pad goes on here.
},
{
    152.42,154.08
     And when your foot turns out,
},
{
    154.08,156.96
     it's gonna stop it from rubbing quite as much
},
{
    156.96,159.88
     on the outside of the shoe.
},
{
    159.88,163.64
     When you put your sock on, this stays tilted back.
},
{
    163.64,168.0
     So the sock helps that if it's just the tip of your toe.
},
{
    168.0,174.16
     So if it's just the tip of this toe, you have this little guy right here.
},
{
    174.16,179.92
     Some people affectionately call it like a, well, you already know what it looks like,
},
{
    179.92,183.08
     but you can see these cones look really good.
},
{
    183.08,186.64
     And then you also have this heavier duty one right here.
},
{
    186.64,189.24
     So you could see this one goes on like this.
},
{
    193.24,195.4
     And then you put your sock on
},
{
    195.4,198.56
     and that'll protect the outside of your foot from rubbing.
},
{
    198.56,201.6
     And you can see I have it sitting on an orthotic.
},
{
    201.6,205.0
     The orthotic provides some bend protection. So see, without the orthotic, the orthotic provides some bend protection.
},
{
    205.0,210.0
     So see, without the orthotic, how easily the foot bends,
},
{
    210.08,212.4
     whereas with the orthotic, see,
},
{
    212.4,214.18
     it's a little bit harder to bend.
},
{
    214.18,217.68
     It gives it a little bit more stability inside a good shoe.
},
{
    217.68,222.2
     Also, if you have a good slipper inside the house,
},
{
    222.2,224.1
     you can see the slipper,
},
{
    224.1,225.28
     this slipper has an
},
{
    225.28,230.56
     orthotic in here. So that can protect it. So you can see an orthotic slipper.
},
{
    230.56,235.88
     An orthotic slipper right there could really help protect things. And another
},
{
    235.88,242.2
     thing is you can see a shoe like this. What you want is I can feel the fifth
},
{
    242.2,245.92
     toe right there. And what you can see with the shoe is
},
{
    245.92,247.76
     it's all mesh right here.
},
{
    247.76,250.4
     See where this stitching is right here?
},
{
    250.4,252.92
     Some shoes have the stitching right here.
},
{
    252.92,254.8
     So especially dress shoes,
},
{
    254.8,258.4
     you wanna be careful where your fifth toe is
},
{
    258.4,260.56
     that you only have mesh.
},
{
    260.56,262.98
     Otherwise your broken toe is gonna hurt.
},
{
    262.98,266.28
     If you don't have these gel pads at home,
},
{
    266.28,271.0
     what you can do is grab the Kleenex and a piece of tape.
},
{
    271.0,275.5
     So what I like to do is a piece of duct tape,
},
{
    277.28,280.76
     you rip the duct tape in half right there.
},
{
    280.76,285.0
     And here is all you do for your fifth toe.
},
{
    285.24,288.86
     So here's the fifth toe buddy fracture.
},
{
    288.86,293.86
     So you take this, I like to pad in between the toe.
},
{
    296.56,300.28
     And this right here, I just wrap it a few times.
},
{
    300.28,301.44
     See what I'm doing?
},
{
    301.44,304.72
     I just like to go up in between.
},
{
    304.72,305.76
     So be careful so you don't
},
{
    305.76,312.84
     injure your fifth toe. And then up above
},
{
    315.28,332.0
     and then up around like that so you can see it's nice and padded. And then you take your tape right there.
},
{
    332.0,335.76
     So see what I did. I just taped around here.
},
{
    335.76,355.24
     Then you take your other tape like this. And right now you have yourself a toe cast right there. So that
},
{
    355.24,362.96
     toe cast is the equivalent of something like this or something like this. So how
},
{
    362.96,366.24
     do you treat this? So number one you can see there's a lot of tendons
},
{
    366.24,368.12
     on top of your foot right here.
},
{
    368.12,370.82
     The problem is that when you're walking,
},
{
    370.82,374.84
     these tendons are firing and they're pulling on the toe.
},
{
    374.84,378.36
     And what happens is you wanna wear a walking boot.
},
{
    378.36,382.76
     So a walking boot, even though it's really overkill,
},
{
    382.76,384.96
     if you're having pain, it will help you get better
},
{
    384.96,385.12
     because it will stop you get better because
},
{
    385.12,388.32
     it will stop those tendons from firing.
},
{
    388.32,392.12
     It will stop your toe from bending and that will let it heal the quickest.
},
{
    392.12,397.44
     The whole point of the walking boot is that it will stop the tendons to your toes from
},
{
    397.44,403.36
     crossing your ankle and firing there because all these tendons start on the leg.
},
{
    403.36,405.6
     And at first people seem like it's crazy to wear a boot
},
{
    405.6,411.28
     But when they're not getting better for weeks or months and their toes are still aching without relief
},
{
    411.4,415.44
     That's when this makes sense if you want this to heal as quick as possible
},
{
    416.12,420.92
     You want to get yourself a walking boot and you want to heal as quickly as possible
},
{
    421.92,427.44
     So this is reserved for people who aren't getting better or have a major toe
},
{
    427.44,433.28
     fracture that's worse than it seems. So there's a lot of evidence behind stopping the tendons
},
{
    433.28,437.92
     crossing your ankle and that's the point of the walking boot. Surgical shoes good but if you're
},
{
    437.92,445.84
     doing a surgical shoe you might as well just get a great shoe like this with a stiff insert. So this one has a stiff insert.
},
{
    445.84,447.68
     See how it can't really bend?
},
{
    447.68,449.92
     I can't bend, that's as hard as I'm pushing.
},
{
    449.92,451.8
     And the fifth toe right here,
},
{
    451.8,455.28
     you can see there's a mesh where the fifth toe is.
},
{
    455.28,457.04
     So there's some links,
},
{
    457.04,458.82
     but that's called the carbon fiber insert.
},
{
    458.82,460.92
     They're like 50 bucks.
},
{
    460.92,463.68
     It's an alternative if you can't wear a walking boot,
},
{
    463.68,469.12
     but otherwise a walking boot will help you heal the quickest. If that's not working you got to see your
},
{
    469.12,473.16
     podiatrist. You have to get an x-ray. There's no substitute for getting an x-ray
},
{
    473.16,478.0
     imaging and making sure none of those critically wrong things are going on. So
},
{
    478.0,483.08
     that's how you tell your fifth toe. Is it broken? Is it sprayed? And that's how you
},
{
    483.08,493.68
     take care of it with body taping.
},
