     In this video, I'm going to show you how to relieve your whole back pain in seconds. Stay tuned.

    8.96,13.68
     Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. In this video,
},
{
    13.68,18.08
     I'm going to go over easy, effective, whole back stretching exercises that are pretty much going
},
{
    18.08,22.32
     to target from the base of the neck all the way down to the lower back into the pelvis. All these
},
{
    22.32,25.08
     exercises hit the back just a little bit differently,
},
{
    25.08,28.0
     so go through them all and take what is most effective
},
{
    28.0,29.96
     at getting rid of your full back pain.
},
{
    29.96,32.44
     As a bonus, all these exercises can be done at home,
},
{
    32.44,34.28
     don't require any special equipment
},
{
    34.28,38.16
     and may give quick relief, even in as little as 30 seconds.
},
{
    38.16,40.76
     So let's get started and get rid of that whole back pain
},
{
    40.76,41.6
     right now.
},
{
    41.6,43.92
     This exercise is what I like to call the door circuit
},
{
    43.92,47.68
     and it's one of my personal favorites. I find myself doing it at work pretty much on a
},
{
    47.68,52.36
     daily basis. It's a two-part exercise that's really going to target a lot of
},
{
    52.36,56.08
     muscles in a short amount of time. In the first part we're going to focus on
},
{
    56.08,60.4
     forward flexion and then extension that is backwards movement to put a lot of
},
{
    60.4,64.96
     good mobility into the back. This one is known as the door cat camel. I'm going to
},
{
    64.96,68.66
     go next to a door frame. I'm going to place my toes flush against the
},
{
    68.66,72.26
     door frame for a stable anchor point. From there my hands just grip at it just
},
{
    72.26,76.82
     like this. Let's do the first flexed part. So I'm going to take two fingers, place
},
{
    76.82,81.34
     them on the chin, and then I'm going to do a simple chin tuck. From there what I'm
},
{
    81.34,84.74
     going to do is keep my legs straight at the knee and then lower my butt down
},
{
    84.74,88.14
     towards the floor or towards the other side of the door frame.
},
{
    88.14,92.18
     The more that you go down, the more intense the stretch is going to be felt in the legs,
},
{
    92.18,95.4
     the back of the hamstrings, glutes, buttocks throughout the whole back.
},
{
    95.4,97.24
     It's a great stretch.
},
{
    97.24,102.48
     What we want to do is go to a comfortable stretch, hold this for 20 seconds while also doing
},
{
    102.48,104.86
     nice slow controlled breathing.
},
{
    104.86,107.5
     Really focus on just letting the tension out.
},
{
    107.5,109.08
     From there, let's go into extension.
},
{
    109.08,110.84
     So what I'm going to do is come back up.
},
{
    110.84,114.64
     I'm going to take my head back like this, arch it back, and then focus on taking the
},
{
    114.64,118.82
     belly button and pressing that in towards the door just like this.
},
{
    118.82,121.08
     You're going to feel a little bit of a different stretch.
},
{
    121.08,123.36
     It's going to hit the muscles just differently.
},
{
    123.36,128.96
     Again, focus on a comfortable stretch. Hold this for 20 seconds while doing slow control breathing
},
{
    128.96,133.2
     and then what you're going to do is just repeat this one very very slowly over
},
{
    133.2,137.24
     and over again for about five complete repetitions. With each repetition you
},
{
    137.24,141.72
     really want to focus on stretching into it a little bit more because that's only
},
{
    141.72,150.8
     going to help get everything moving and hopefully get rid of that back pain even quicker. And the second part what I'm going to do is focus a little bit more
},
{
    150.8,156.8
     on lateral bending to hit a muscle called the quadratus lumborum or the QL muscle. The QL is one
},
{
    156.8,162.88
     of the biggest instigators of back pain. This one is also very easy. My feet go together. I'm going
},
{
    162.88,165.04
     to go next to a door frame. What I'm going to do
},
{
    165.04,170.16
     is press my body that is closest into the door frame into it by taking my hand and just pushing
},
{
    170.16,175.6
     on the other side's hip. We want to then raise the arm like this on the side that's closest to the
},
{
    175.6,181.28
     door frame overhead. So while I'm pressing my body into the door frame, I'm going to lean
},
{
    181.28,185.16
     away from it with my upper body. You're going to feel a great stretch,
},
{
    185.16,186.56
     pretty much from the armpit,
},
{
    186.56,188.5
     all the way down to the lower back.
},
{
    188.5,191.04
     Really focus on trying to drive the body over
},
{
    191.04,193.3
     into that lateral bend as much as you can.
},
{
    193.3,195.26
     Again, 20 seconds holds.
},
{
    195.26,197.2
     What I'm going to do from there is take a breather
},
{
    197.2,199.6
     and then repeat this up to five times
},
{
    199.6,201.76
     with each repetition, stretch into it
},
{
    201.76,203.96
     even more to your comfort level only.
},
{
    203.96,208.72
     And when you're done on one side, always switch to the other to keep them both in balance.
},
{
    208.72,211.4
     This full back stretching exercise is wonderful.
},
{
    211.4,214.88
     It's pretty much going to target everything from the base to the neck all the way down
},
{
    214.88,216.08
     to the tailbone.
},
{
    216.08,217.96
     We just need a flat elevated surface.
},
{
    217.96,221.04
     You can use the edge of a bed, a couch, a desk, or a chair.
},
{
    221.04,222.28
     It all works.
},
{
    222.28,225.24
     We also need a towel or pillow underneath our knees for
},
{
    225.24,229.72
     extra comfort. So let's go up to that flat elevated surface. I'm going to bend my
},
{
    229.72,233.72
     arms like this at the elbow, place the backside of my arms on that flat surface
},
{
    233.72,237.76
     for a stable anchor point. Let's take our hands, place them on the back of the
},
{
    237.76,241.56
     shoulders just like this. Let's then do a simple chin tuck that is taking the
},
{
    241.56,249.12
     chin towards the chest. From there, movement very easy. Let's take our body weight, pretty much, our butt and lower it down
},
{
    249.12,252.6
     towards our heels. The more that you go down, the more that you're going to feel
},
{
    252.6,256.14
     a stretch, start to happen in the upper back and almost like a domino effect, it
},
{
    256.14,260.28
     works its way down all the way down to the lower back into the pelvis to the
},
{
    260.28,264.96
     tailbone. Once we hit a very comfortable stretch, let's hold this one for 20
},
{
    264.96,266.0
     seconds.
},
{
    266.0,270.56
     But you can challenge yourself and hold it for a longer period if you feel comfortable.
},
{
    270.56,275.0
     Half minute, one minute, challenge yourself. But when we need a break, just come back up,
},
{
    275.0,279.52
     take a breather, and then repeat this one up to five times. With each repetition, try
},
{
    279.52,285.0
     to drive down just a little bit further to stretch everything out even more.
},
{
    285.0,289.68
     And the second part what I'm going to do is place my hands right out in front of me.
},
{
    289.68,291.64
     We want our arms straight at the elbow.
},
{
    291.64,296.32
     Let's take our fingers to and grip into that surface for a stable anchor point.
},
{
    296.32,301.04
     Let's do that simple chin tuck and then I'm going to lower my butt down towards my heels.
},
{
    301.04,305.52
     But with this one what I'm going to do is then angle my body slightly in one direction. In this case it's my heels. But with this one what I'm going to do is then angle my body slightly in one direction.
},
{
    305.52,310.64
     In this case it's my right. When you do this you're going to feel the muscles get activated just a
},
{
    310.64,315.6
     little bit differently. So throw a repetition in for 20 seconds, hold this, come back up,
},
{
    315.6,321.12
     and then move over or I should say slide over just a little bit more. Experiment with this.
},
{
    321.12,325.08
     Try to go in a complete arc as far over as you can go.
},
{
    327.76,328.04
     And then when you're done on one side, switch to the other.
},
{
    331.16,333.08
     And if you do notice that one certain movement, like let's say it's right here for me,
},
{
    333.36,335.88
     is just really stretching a tight muscle,
},
{
    335.92,337.92
     a muscle that feels like it needs more tension.
},
{
    338.18,341.68
     I make note of that and then try to stretch into it even more,
},
{
    341.68,348.4
     throw more repetitions in because it's only going to help target those tight muscles that might be causing that back pain.
},
{
    348.4,352.24
     What we want to do from there is put a little bit more rotation in, that is a
},
{
    352.24,355.88
     twisting motion. So what I'm going to do is go straight out in front of me and
},
{
    355.88,359.72
     then I'm going to do that lowering of the butt towards the heels and once I hit
},
{
    359.72,363.16
     that comfortable stretch I'm going to take one arm, palm side up towards the
},
{
    363.16,368.68
     ceiling and then reach over towards the other side. So my right arm is reaching towards my left. You
},
{
    368.68,371.84
     should really feel this one in the upper back in between the shoulder blades.
},
{
    371.84,375.68
     Challenge yourself to reach over as much as you can. Once we hit a very
},
{
    375.68,379.72
     comfortable stretch, let's hold this for 20 seconds. From there, you're going to
},
{
    379.72,384.24
     relax, take a breather, and then you're going to repeat this on the other side. Do
},
{
    384.24,386.0
     this for five complete repetitions.
},
{
    386.0,390.0
     But with all of these movements, focus on making note of
},
{
    390.0,394.0
     any of the spots, or you should say angles, movements, whatever,
},
{
    394.0,397.0
     that are causing a little bit of a better stretch, and they're
},
{
    397.0,400.0
     targeting muscles that are tight and anky, and stretch into
},
{
    400.0,403.0
     it, and hopefully you'll get a lot of pain relief very,
},
{
    403.0,404.0
     very quickly.
},
{
    404.0,406.48
     So here's a great way to let gravity
},
{
    406.48,408.24
     do all the hard work for us.
},
{
    408.24,411.36
     This is a decompression or traction based exercise.
},
{
    411.36,414.04
     Think a great stretch throughout the whole back
},
{
    414.04,415.64
     to get everything loosened up.
},
{
    415.64,417.8
     You can do this one right in bed.
},
{
    417.8,420.2
     I'm going to lay on my stomach and I'm just going to slide
},
{
    420.2,423.36
     forward off the edge of that bed until my waist
},
{
    423.36,426.32
     through my upper body is off the bed, but my pelvis
},
{
    426.32,431.36
     and legs are supported on the bed. Let's just do a simple chin tuck from here, and then I'm going to
},
{
    431.36,436.08
     go down on my elbows like this. You're already going to feel a great stretch throughout the whole
},
{
    436.08,441.6
     back. You want to focus on just letting the upper body, the upper back, just sag down towards the
},
{
    441.6,448.96
     floor too. You'll get a better stretch into the upper and middle backs. But try to hold this position for at least 30 seconds. But if you feel comfortable,
},
{
    448.96,453.6
     challenge yourself to hold it longer, up to a minute or longer, but again, only to your comfort
},
{
    453.6,458.24
     level. When you need a breather, just push yourself back up with your arms like this.
},
{
    458.24,462.72
     But on the next repetition, you want to inch forward just a little bit more because it's
},
{
    462.72,469.6
     only going to help pretty much increase that traction forward and give you more relief. But you want to do
},
{
    469.6,473.72
     this one nice and slow for three to five repetitions. If you want to take this one
},
{
    473.72,477.56
     to the next level instead of going on our elbows let's straighten our arms at
},
{
    477.56,482.0
     the elbows like this and lock our fingers into the floor and crawl forward as
},
{
    482.0,485.98
     much as you can. Really focus on allowing the upper back again
},
{
    485.98,488.16
     to sag down towards the floor.
},
{
    488.16,490.12
     And this feels great.
},
{
    490.12,492.2
     Again, hold this for at least 30 seconds,
},
{
    492.2,494.36
     but you can hold it longer if you feel comfortable
},
{
    494.36,496.44
     and try to do this one for three to five
},
{
    496.44,497.56
     complete repetitions.
},
{
    497.56,500.08
     To take this one to even the next level,
},
{
    500.08,503.62
     let's just angle our body a little bit towards one direction.
},
{
    503.62,506.2
     I'm going a little bit towards my right with this one.
},
{
    506.2,509.84
     You're going to feel the muscles get hit just a little bit differently.
},
{
    509.84,514.16
     What you want to do is pretty much experiment by going through a complete arc on one side
},
{
    514.16,516.4
     and then switching towards the other.
},
{
    516.4,521.76
     Make note of any certain angle or any certain spot that feels like it's hitting those tight,
},
{
    521.76,523.8
     achy muscles a little bit more.
},
{
    523.8,530.64
     Throw more repetitions in there and just try to stretch it out and hopefully this gives you very quick relief. With this full
},
{
    530.64,535.6
     back stretching exercise we're going to focus a little bit more on rotation. That's twisting motions
},
{
    535.6,540.8
     in the back to get everything loosened up. We're also going to focus on the hip flexors which are
},
{
    540.8,547.28
     commonly overlooked when it comes to back pain. This is known as a sprinkler, and we just need to go next to a wall.
},
{
    547.28,548.96
     Whatever side is closest to the wall,
},
{
    548.96,550.44
     the knee is going to be at 90 degrees.
},
{
    550.44,552.62
     I want the knee to hip to the shoulder flush
},
{
    552.62,553.76
     against the wall.
},
{
    553.76,556.1
     The other knee is also going to be bent at 90 degrees,
},
{
    556.1,558.12
     and let's put a pillow or towel underneath it
},
{
    558.12,559.64
     for extra comfort.
},
{
    559.64,561.92
     Let's have very good posture to start off with.
},
{
    561.92,563.2
     Nice upright positioning.
},
{
    563.2,567.08
     Let's tuck the chin very slightly. I'm going to straighten the arms like this to the
},
{
    567.08,571.36
     point where the hands are overlapping. Let's focus on the hip flexors to begin
},
{
    571.36,575.68
     with. So I'm going to lunge with my body weight forward as much as I can. When you
},
{
    575.68,578.96
     do this, the knee that is touching the ground, you're going to start to feel a
},
{
    578.96,582.84
     very good stretch into the top part of the leg, even into the groin. That's that
},
{
    582.84,586.48
     hip flexors starting to fire. Once we hit a very comfortable stretch,
},
{
    586.48,589.6
     what we want to do is build a little bit more rotation into it.
},
{
    589.6,592.16
     So I'm going to take the hand that is not touching the wall
},
{
    592.16,595.04
     and I'm going to start to rotate my whole body
},
{
    595.04,597.52
     towards the other side, just like this.
},
{
    597.52,601.36
     When you do this exercise, you want to feel like it's moving from the glute hips,
},
{
    601.36,604.64
     lower back into the upper back, all the way into the neck.
},
{
    604.64,608.22
     Really focus on getting that whole back stretch.
},
{
    608.22,612.98
     Once we hit a very comfortable stretch, let's hold this one for 20 seconds and then slowly
},
{
    612.98,614.1
     come back.
},
{
    614.1,618.74
     On the next repetition, let's drive forward a little bit more and then try to do even
},
{
    618.74,622.5
     a more rotational stretch to get everything moving.
},
{
    622.5,624.38
     Challenge yourself with each repetition.
},
{
    624.38,626.76
     But you want to do this one just nice and slowly
},
{
    626.76,628.96
     for about three to five repetitions.
},
{
    628.96,630.96
     And then when you're done on one side,
},
