     I've been struggling with dry lips as you've probably seen from the thumbnail and
},
{
    4.76,8.08
     To the point where I wake up with busted lips and I had just like scabs
},
{
    8.12,11.7
     So I want to show you how to get rid of severely dry
},
{
    12.6,14.8
     dehydrated flaky or crack lips
},
{
    21.2,26.34
     I would just keep picking them off the problem is getting severely dry skin on your lips to the point that it scabs.
},
{
    26.54,29.3
     If you pick it off, you haven't given enough time to heal.
},
{
    29.3,36.34
     Now you're gonna fix it is basically to take the same concept as my pedicure videos, meaning that you're actually going to soak your lips.
},
{
    36.34,38.68
     Yes, you heard that right. You're going to soak your lips.
},
{
    39.3,42.6
     However, there's two ways that you can do this. You could just do like a facial steam.
},
{
    42.6,49.2
     Like if you guys saw my DIY natural skincare routine, then you saw me make like a herbal or botanical tea.
},
{
    49.2,52.24
     I'll put a link to that in the card so that you guys can see what I'm talking about.
},
{
    52.72,56.72
     Or I happened to pick up some eye patches when I went to Muji recently when I was in New York.
},
{
    56.88,62.32
     I was just trying to have like a smaller piece of like film or cloth on my lips while I was sitting there,
},
{
    62.32,67.8
     you know, like on my phone for 10 to 15 minutes because if you have like a whole washcloth on your face it might be kind of difficult
},
{
    67.8,72.0
     to like lay down and not get the rest of your face your neck your clothes or your hair wet.
},
{
    72.0,75.36
     So I used those and I will link those down in the description box in case you guys want
},
{
    75.36,80.08
     to do the same thing and honestly I do believe that the salt helps it so if you do have not
},
{
    80.08,84.8
     just dry but actually scabby lips would highly recommend that you add sea salt from your kitchen.
},
{
    84.8,85.52
     I said I just looked it up for 10 to 15 minutes and I took my patch off and then I took like not just dry but actually scabby lips, would highly recommend that you add sea salt from your kitchen.
},
{
    85.52,87.24
     I said I'd just let that on for 10 to 15 minutes
},
{
    87.24,88.24
     and I took my patch off
},
{
    88.24,90.08
     and then I took like a textured washcloth.
},
{
    90.08,91.6
     The same charcoal one that I talked about
},
{
    91.6,94.28
     in my pre and post Brazilian care video.
},
{
    94.28,95.48
     I think it's more hatha.
},
{
    95.48,98.04
     It has a very specific like weave or texture to it.
},
{
    98.04,100.92
     I would end with the like nubbier side of that washcloth
},
{
    100.92,102.96
     and I just gently exfoliate my lips.
},
{
    102.96,105.52
     I didn't even like necessarily press down really hard
},
{
    105.52,107.96
     and as you guys can see, that skin came right off.
},
{
    107.96,112.96
     But if that's not the case for you, it's okay to do this
},
{
    120.72,122.2
     over the course of like two or three days.
},
{
    122.2,124.16
     And you do want to make sure that the cloth is wet as well.
},
{
    124.16,126.88
     Final step and this is also one of the most important steps
},
{
    126.88,129.48
     because exfoliation is only part of the process,
},
{
    129.48,133.12
     you do want to apply a super thick lip mask.
},
{
    133.12,136.32
     Not a balm, not a gloss, but a mask.
},
{
    136.32,137.48
     So the one that I use is from Bite,
},
{
    137.48,140.12
     and you guys probably even heard me talking about it on
},
{
    140.12,142.84
     Instagram recently, specifically because when I put it on
},
{
    142.84,149.04
     at night and I wake up in the morning, it's still there. That is exactly what you need out of a lit mask or like a really heavy balm
},
{
    149.04,153.92
     It should not absorb into the skin too quickly because we really need a barrier
},
{
    153.92,158.88
     That's just gonna sit on top of the skin and hold the moisture in the reason why your lips are so
},
{
    159.12,162.24
     Gehydrated is because you may not be possibly drinking enough water
},
{
    162.24,163.84
     Which is usually the case for me
},
{
    163.84,166.04
     But even after upping my water intake
},
{
    166.04,168.76
     I still wasn't seeing like the results that I wanted to.
},
{
    168.76,173.44
     So keep in mind that your skin isn't necessarily always benefiting from how much water you're drinking.
},
{
    173.44,178.4
     There are a lot of other daily functions that your body performs, which are also using that.
},
{
    178.4,181.6
     However, I'm gonna talk about actually two different ways to exfoliate your lips.
},
{
    183.04,187.2
     If your lips were severely dehydrated and now they're kind of okay but you want to do
},
{
    187.2,190.24
     maintenance then you can use this scrub for that as well.
},
{
    190.24,192.88
     So I grabbed some thermodontalos, sugar, or sugar you can use whatever sugar of course
},
{
    192.88,194.4
     that you have in your house.
},
{
    194.4,197.68
     And then I mixed that with some black castor oil.
},
{
    197.68,199.88
     Again, feel free to use any oil that you have.
},
{
    199.88,203.32
     Coconut, almond, jojoba will work just as well.
},
{
    203.32,206.04
     I've just been liking the castor oil because it's a little bit thicker
},
{
    206.04,207.72
     and so it's gonna be left behind
},
{
    207.72,209.2
     when I rinse away the sugar
},
{
    209.2,211.2
     and again, it's gonna give me that barrier
},
{
    211.2,212.32
     that I really need.
},
{
    212.32,214.84
     So again, just sugar, oil,
},
{
    214.84,217.0
     and then to that I add a little bit of vanilla
},
{
    217.0,218.28
     and mint extract.
},
{
    218.28,229.8
     I hope you guys liked this video.
