    11.12,12.92
     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.
},
{
    12.92,14.08
     Brad Heineck, physical therapist.
},

    14.08,16.04
     We are the most famous physical therapists on the internet.
},
{
    16.04,17.4
     In our opinion, of course, Bob.
},
{
    17.4,18.8
     Today we're gonna talk about how to massage

     your foot pain away, a simple self massage.
},
{
    22.0,24.28
     We're gonna show just three simple techniques.
},
{
    24.28,25.1
     Right.
},
{
    25.1,26.44
     I know why it makes things complicated.
},
{
    26.44,27.8
     Exactly, Bob.

},
{
    49.76,50.92
     Are we giving away this right now?
},
{
    50.92,53.08
     We're giving away the pelvic rocker.
},
{
    53.08,54.68
     This is a great abdominal strength.
},
{
    54.68,57.44
     Anyone who's also good for anterior pelvic tilt
},
{
    57.44,58.28
     and all those things.
},
{
    58.28,60.36
     Yeah, we got a couple of videos on it.
},
{
    60.36,61.56
     I'm impressed with it, Bob.
},
{
    61.56,63.76
     All right, so let's go to the massage, Brad.
},
{
    63.76,65.28
     Let's quit wasting time here.
},
{
    65.28,67.24
     So three simple ones to do.
},
{
    67.24,69.08
     You know, this is great for plantar fasciitis.
},
{
    69.08,71.52
     If you hit a section that's really tender,
},
{
    71.52,73.28
     work around that section.
},
{
    73.28,75.24
     Don't hit it right away.
},
{
    75.24,78.12
     The first one I like Brad is to actually do circles.
},
{
    78.12,82.28
     Now you can do circles using one finger on top of another,
},
{
    82.28,84.16
     or you can actually take your knuckle
},
{
    84.16,86.66
     and use that to make circles.
},
{
    86.66,89.36
     But that really helps break things up.
},
{
    89.36,91.22
     If you have some scar tissue in there,
},
{
    91.22,93.46
     or if you have some, you know,
},
{
    93.46,95.9
     maybe micro tears that are healing,
},
{
    95.9,97.64
     this can actually work things out.
},
{
    97.64,98.98
     Muscles that are tight,
},
{
    98.98,101.12
     those little muscles that are in your foot
},
{
    101.12,102.4
     that kind of hold things in.
},
{
    102.4,104.56
     And the other thing is,
},
{
    104.56,105.96
     a lot of times your fingers get tired
},
{
    105.96,109.16
     if you're using your fingers and you switch a new technique
},
{
    109.16,110.72
     just so that you give your fingers a break.
},
{
    110.72,111.88
     That's a very good point, Brad,
},
{
    111.88,114.36
     because actually it's hard on your joints even,
},
{
    114.36,117.0
     the fingers, especially if you're arthritis
},
{
    117.0,120.0
     or anything like that, it makes it more difficult.
},
{
    120.0,121.64
     So you can do some circles,
},
{
    121.64,124.88
     and you can go all the way through into the heel even,
},
{
    124.88,127.78
     and all up to these pads up here too.
},
{
    127.78,130.64
     All right, the next one is what we call a spleen massage.
},
{
    130.64,135.4
     S-P-L-A-I-S-P-L-A-Y-I-N-G.
},
{
    135.4,137.04
     And this is really good for plant affection.
},
{
    137.04,138.76
     Did you find it important to spell it?
},
{
    138.76,140.72
     Well, I thought they maybe couldn't understand me.
},
{
    140.72,143.08
     They just say spain or spleen or whatever.
},
{
    143.08,143.92
     What is he saying?
},
{
    143.92,144.92
     I don't know.
},
{
    144.92,146.76
     So, all right.
},
{
    146.76,148.08
     This is a nice technique.
},
{
    148.08,148.92
     Yeah, this is a nice technique.
},
{
    148.92,150.48
     So what we're doing is we're taking our thumbs,
},
{
    150.48,153.96
     we start in the middle and you pull it apart like this.
},
{
    153.96,157.36
     And again, if it's too tender to do it, work around it.
},
{
    157.36,158.98
     Hit the areas that you can tolerate.
},
{
    158.98,160.36
     Generally with plantar fasciitis,
},
{
    160.36,161.96
     you're gonna have pain right here.
},
{
    161.96,165.48
     So I might start right up here and work on it.
},
{
    165.48,167.92
     Now you can also use your palms.
},
{
    167.92,168.76
     The fatty.
},
{
    168.76,171.64
     I've got a thumb injury, so I'm forced to use my palms
},
{
    171.64,173.08
     and I'm not working out well.
},
{
    173.08,176.32
     Using the fat pads of your thumbs, basically.
},
{
    176.32,178.04
     Is that the hypothenareminence?
},
{
    178.04,179.88
     Yeah, I think that's the phenareminence.
},
{
    179.88,181.36
     I got it.
},
{
    181.36,182.28
     Hypo is the other side.
},
{
    182.28,183.56
     Well, it'd be both, right?
},
{
    183.56,185.28
     Well, no, it's both the thing.
},
{
    185.28,189.04
     That's a fair technical discussion here.
},
{
    189.04,190.24
     And then last one, again,
},
{
    190.24,191.76
     trying to keep things real simple.
},
{
    191.76,193.28
     You're just gonna do what we call laundry,
},
{
    193.28,194.12
     to do a massage.
},
{
    194.12,198.36
     You're going along with the fibers of the tissues.
},
{
    198.36,200.84
     And again, you can use fingers on top of finger,
},
{
    200.84,202.64
     or you can use the whole hand here.
},
{
    202.64,204.64
     You can also use the palm there.
},
{
    205.8,207.44
     You know, you do this right before you go to bed Brad
},
{
    207.44,208.8
     and you're gonna sleep like a baby.
},
{
    208.8,209.64
     Oh yeah.
},
{
    209.64,211.76
     I mean, it's gonna just, your feet are gonna feel great.
},
{
    211.76,213.4
     Well, it really gets a circulation.
},
{
    213.4,215.68
     If your person that always has cold feet,
},
{
    215.68,218.36
     this is definitely gonna help increase the circulation
},
{
    218.36,219.2
     and hopefully warm them up.
},
{
    219.2,220.24
     Well, I would say even with neuropathy,
},
{
    220.24,223.04
     I'd give it a try because the more you get blood flow
},
{
    223.04,225.96
     to an area, the better it is for the nerves.
},
{
    225.96,228.2
     So now, there's many of you out there,
},
{
    228.2,231.4
     I'm sure Brad, that don't wanna massage their own feet.
},
{
    231.4,233.44
     My wife has done it for me.
},
{
    233.44,234.36
     No kidding.
},
{
    234.36,235.64
     Not very often.
},
{
    235.64,238.16
     This is when you were dating or was this when you were?
},
{
    238.16,240.44
     Even status post-marriage?
},
{
    240.44,243.2
     Wow, she's a wonderful wife.
},
{
    243.2,244.04
     I love her to death.
},
{
    244.04,244.88
     That's a shocking thing to me.
},
{
    244.88,246.16
     But it doesn't happen a lot.
},
{
    246.16,248.24
     So this is a little more dependable.
},
{
    248.24,252.54
     Right, we've mentioned a unit like this in the past,
},
{
    252.54,255.06
     and this one actually they sent it to us,
},
{
    255.06,258.26
     and this one actually is better than the one we had before.
},
{
    258.26,261.56
     This is the Renfold R-E-N-P-H-O, is it all right
},
{
    261.56,262.4
     if I say that?
},
{
    262.4,263.24
     Go ahead, spell it off.
},
{
    263.24,264.94
     You can put the spell it up there, Marcus.
},
{
    264.94,267.36
     Shiatso foot massager.
},
{
    267.36,270.36
     This one is less expensive and I think it works better.
},
{
    270.36,271.24
     Shiatso.
},
{
    271.24,274.52
     Yeah, and we have it in our Amazon description down below
},
{
    274.52,276.36
     in our Amazon preferred products.
},
{
    276.36,278.12
     But these things are awesome.
},
{
    278.12,281.32
     I mean, anybody we have try it,
},
{
    281.32,283.48
     I mean, in fact, I wanna do a video, Brad,
},
{
    283.48,285.94
     where we just show people who are trying this.
},
{
    285.94,287.24
     Seriously, have people try it
},
{
    287.24,288.8
     and get their first reaction.
},
{
    288.8,290.42
     Whatever you will say, Bob.
},
{
    290.42,292.8
     I think you're probably limited to a size 12.
},
{
    292.8,295.32
     That's what Liz was saying, camera woman.
},
{
    295.32,296.64
     Do you have size 12?
},
{
    296.64,297.48
     I have size 12.
},
{
    297.48,298.32
     I should put my sock back on.
},
{
    298.32,299.6
     Yeah, put your sock back on.
},
{
    299.6,300.72
     Oh my God.
},
{
    300.72,304.32
     Well, I just broke the quarantine on it.
},
{
    304.32,306.04
     Yeah, no kidding.
},
{
    306.04,308.92
     By the way, you can take out the inner lining
},
{
    308.92,311.84
     and wash it and sterilize it if you need to.
},
{
    311.84,314.24
     Make sure you take it out before you wash it, yeah.
},
{
    314.24,315.76
     So it's got a timer on there,
},
{
    315.76,318.2
     so you can set the timer for, you know,
},
{
    318.2,322.24
     I think got 15, 20, was it 15, 30 minutes.
},
{
    322.24,324.44
     Okay, Liz knows more about than I do.
},
{
    324.44,328.62
     And it's got a kneading intensity, low, medium, and high.
},
{
    328.62,330.08
     And it's got an air intensity
},
{
    330.08,331.72
     where it kind of squeezes your foot.
},
{
    331.72,335.12
     So what I like about this is when it gets the whole foot.
},
{
    335.12,338.08
     It's not just part of it, it gets upper foot, lower foot.
},
{
    338.08,341.08
     Right, there's the compression completely encapsulates it.
},
{
    341.08,344.8
     And I like it because you can vary independently
},
{
    344.8,348.68
     the air compression versus the mechanical massage.
},
{
    348.68,349.52
     Right.
},
{
    349.52,350.64
     And what you can do with this,
},
{
    350.64,352.0
     I would recommend by the way,
},
{
    352.0,353.64
     is start on the lowest setting,
},
{
    353.64,355.04
     see how you tolerate it.
},
{
    355.04,357.56
     If that's not enough, go to the medium.
},
{
    357.56,359.04
     But don't jump into the high one
},
{
    359.04,361.56
     because for some of us it's a little bit-
},
{
    361.56,362.4
     Aggressive.
},
{
    362.4,363.24
     Aggressive, yeah.
},
{
    363.24,364.24
     And that's what I wanted to see
},
{
    364.24,365.88
     because I've got old feet and there's gotta be young aggressive. Aggressive, yeah. And that's what I wanted to see because I've got old feet
},
{
    365.88,367.6
     and there's gotta be young feet that are saying,
},
{
    367.6,369.88
     hey, I wanna have as much as you can give me here.
},
{
    369.88,370.72
     So.
},
{
    370.72,371.56
     You've got old everything, Bob.
},
{
    371.56,372.4
     Head to toe.
},
{
    372.4,373.24
     That's true.
},
{
    373.24,374.08
     I'm not gonna deny it though.
},
{
    374.08,375.36
     Okay, I'm on the elder side of life.
},
{
    375.36,376.84
     Well, I'm not far behind.
},
{
    376.84,379.28
     I gotta admit, and there's also a heat setting,
},
{
    379.28,382.48
     which again on this one, I don't know if it's very.
},
{
    382.48,384.52
     No offense, but I just, on any of these,
},
{
    384.52,385.88
     I just don't feel much heat.
},
{
    385.88,387.4
     Well, they're just, you know,
},
{
    387.4,389.04
     they run on 12 volts of the skinny core.
},
{
    389.04,391.64
     You can't develop much heat with that power.
},
{
    391.64,393.32
     But you're not buying this thing with heat.
},
{
    393.32,395.08
     You're buying this thing because this thing
},
{
    395.08,396.48
     is a great massage.
},
{
    396.48,397.42
     And I like the price,
},
{
    397.42,400.28
     because the old one we had up there was like $150.
},
{
    400.28,404.32
     This is $105.99, but they have a $10 off coupon.
},
{
    404.32,405.0
     So you're down to 95.
},
{
    406.44,408.72
     You can't pay someone, you won't be able to pay someone
},
{
    408.72,410.84
     to give you massages like this every night.
},
{
    410.84,413.92
     And when your feet are sore, I mean, I just sit there,
},
{
    413.92,416.32
     I'll run it through like five times.

     Yeah, yeah, yeah.
},
