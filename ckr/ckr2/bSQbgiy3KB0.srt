     What are the seven steps of effective wound management?
},
{
    9.84,12.08
     Why is each step important?
},
{
    12.08,14.84
     And what happens during each one?
},
{
    14.84,18.92
     Knowing the answers will help you develop and support the most effective treatment plan
},
{
    18.92,21.32
     to promote healing.
},
{
    21.32,26.0
     Let's take a closer look at the role of each step and how it's typically performed by a clinician,
},
{
    26.0,29.0
     such as a certified wound care nurse.
},
{
    29.0,34.0
     Wound assessment is the first and foundation step of proper wound management.
},
{
    34.0,40.0
     The goal is to identify and address all issues that may impact and potentially delay healing.
},
{
    40.0,44.0
     This will help guide the development of the most effective treatment plan
},
{
    44.0,47.56
     in keeping with the health care providers established wound
},
{
    47.56,53.2
     care guidelines. To perform this step inspect and evaluate the wound based on
},
{
    53.2,58.88
     several characteristics. Start by identifying the location, length, width
},
{
    58.88,64.2
     and depth of the wound. Then check for undermining which is a rolled over lip
},
{
    64.2,66.88
     around the wound. Also check for tunnelining, which is a rolled over lip around the wound. Also check
},
{
    66.88,71.16
     for tunneling, which occurs when the wound burrows under the skin.
},
{
    71.16,79.76
     Next, look at the exudate for drainage color, odor, amount, and consistency. And examine
},
{
    79.76,85.0
     the tissue appearance for color and moisture level. Is it wet or dry?
},
{
    85.0,88.0
     Another important characteristic is the periwound,
},
{
    88.0,91.0
     which is the area surrounding the wound itself.
},
{
    91.0,93.0
     Is the periwound intact or macerated,
},
{
    93.0,97.0
     which means shriveled skin caused by prolonged moisture?
},
{
    97.0,100.0
     Then examine the wound for infection in bioburden,
},
{
    100.0,104.0
     which is the state between normal and infected tissue.
},
{
    104.0,108.0
     Is the wound red, a condition called erythema.
},
{
    108.0,111.0
     Is there swelling known as edema?
},
{
    111.0,116.0
     Is the wound warm? Does it have an odor or does the patient have a fever?
},
{
    116.0,120.0
     Lastly, what is the patient's level of pain?
},
{
    120.0,123.0
     By assessing all of these wound characteristics,
},
{
    123.0,125.36
     you'll be in a better position to develop
},
{
    125.36,130.46
     and implement the most effective treatment plan and move on to the next step, cleansing
},
{
    130.46,133.44
     the wound.
},
{
    133.44,137.0
     Cleanse and irrigate the wound per its assessment.
},
{
    137.0,140.96
     Cleansing and irrigating the wound creates the optimum environment for healing in two
},
{
    140.96,141.96
     ways.
},
{
    141.96,148.0
     First, it removes loose debris, exudate, pus, and free-floating bacteria.
},
{
    148.0,151.0
     And second, it supports the wound assessment
},
{
    151.0,154.0
     by making the wound easier to see and evaluate.
},
{
    154.0,157.0
     To cleanse the wound, swab it with dampened gauze
},
{
    157.0,159.0
     or a similar product,
},
{
    159.0,162.0
     and irrigate to remove deeper debris.
},
{
    162.0,165.52
     Step three is to protect the periwound from wound drainage
},
{
    165.52,168.0
     that can cause maceration and skin stripping.
},
{
    171.6,174.48
     Protecting the periwound skin is also essential
},
{
    174.48,178.1
     because it helps prevent the wound from increasing in size.
},
{
    178.1,179.78
     But this can be a challenge
},
{
    179.78,182.96
     because periwound skin can appear normal.
},
{
    182.96,185.52
     As a result, protecting it can be overlooked and damage can occur. To protect the periwound skin can appear normal. As a result, protecting it can be overlooked
},
{
    185.52,187.6
     and damage can occur.
},
{
    187.6,189.28
     To protect the periwound,
},
{
    189.28,191.64
     clean it with a normal saline solution,
},
{
    191.64,195.2
     then apply a non-alcohol-based skin prep solution.
},
{
    196.16,198.64
     Next, fill any depth in the wound
},
{
    198.64,200.48
     by packing all open spaces
},
{
    200.48,202.88
     with the appropriate filling material.
},
{
    202.88,204.28
     This step is important
},
{
    204.28,205.28
     because it helps prevent
},
{
    205.28,207.44
     pockets of abscess from forming,
},
{
    207.44,208.92
     as well as promotes healing.
},
{
    210.12,213.28
     Wounds that require filling include tunneling wounds,
},
{
    213.28,218.0
     undermined wounds, and stage three and four pressure injuries.
},
{
    218.0,220.28
     Fill them based on the wound assessment,
},
{
    220.28,222.92
     the wounds contours and the clinicians discretion.
},
{
    224.4,229.0
     Choose from gauze, foams, fibers, alginates and shells.
},
{
    229.0,233.0
     For infected wounds, add an antimicrobial agent.
},
{
    234.0,238.0
     After filling the wound, apply a protective dressing to cover the wound.
},
{
    238.0,246.24
     The goal is to maintain a clean, moist wound bed, which promotes granulation, healing, and closure.
},
{
    246.24,250.8
     Properly covering the wound also helps prevent infection while the wound is healing, and
},
{
    250.8,254.6
     until healthy skin can resume its infection-preventing role.
},
{
    254.6,259.4
     If the protective dressing doesn't secure itself, apply a secondary dressing.
},
{
    259.4,263.78
     This step helps promote healing by protecting the wound from pathogens.
},
{
    263.78,268.8
     Securing the dressing also secures medical devices and aids in patient mobility.
},
{
    268.8,274.92
     Select the most effective secondary dressing based on provider policy and procedures.
},
{
    274.92,282.8
     Examples include gauze, conforming stretch bandages, tape, transparent film, and composite dressing.
},
{
    282.8,285.94
     These products attach to, cover, or pad the protective
},
{
    285.94,292.12
     dressing and help ensure it stays in place. The final step is to evaluate the
},
{
    292.12,297.04
     wound's healing progress when you change dressings. Is it healing, regressing, or
},
{
    297.04,301.42
     is there no change? Knowing this is important because it can help you
},
{
    301.42,309.0
     determine if the treatment plan is succeeding, or if another approach is required as soon as possible to promote healing.
},
{
    309.0,312.0
     To evaluate the wound, ask yourself,
},
{
    312.0,317.0
     are there any new signs of infection, such as a change in color or odor?
},
{
    317.0,321.0
     Are the protective and secondary dressings staying in place,
},
{
    321.0,326.28
     and if applicable, is the drainage control working?
},
{
    326.28,330.8
     To help promote healing, know the seven steps of effective room management.
