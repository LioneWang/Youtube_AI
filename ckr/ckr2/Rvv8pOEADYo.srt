     Oh, oh, hey everybody, it's Dr. Joe and I've got my dynamic duo, WonderRimmy and Wonder Joe.
},
{
    9.6,14.88
     And today we're going to show you some stretches and exercises to help relieve neck pain. So let's
},
{
    14.88,20.88
     get started. Are you ready? Are you ready? Let's do it. Disclaimer alert, disclaimer alert.
},
{
    23.76,26.28
     So the first set of stretches for the neck are just going to
},
{
    26.28,29.72
     be active range of motion so you're not putting pressure on it you're just
},
{
    29.72,34.24
     getting that neck loosened up. So first you're going to do a rotation side to side.
},
{
    34.24,39.56
     So this one's going to be a little bit of a continuous motion. You can pause for
},
{
    39.56,44.36
     about two to three seconds on each side but you're just getting those muscles
},
{
    44.36,45.9
     moving. So you want to start off just do about five on each side but you're just getting those muscles moving. So you
},
{
    45.9,50.64
     want to start off just do about five on each side with that little pause just to
},
{
    50.64,55.94
     get those neck muscles right there warmed up a little bit. After you do the
},
{
    55.94,60.62
     rotation side to side then you're going to do a side bending. With the side
},
{
    60.62,64.96
     bending you're taking your ear towards your shoulder but you're not bringing
},
{
    64.96,68.64
     your shoulder up to your ear. You want to keep your shoulders down and relaxed,
},
{
    68.64,74.08
     and then just side bend over trying to touch that ear to your shoulder. And again, just hold it for
},
{
    74.08,79.6
     about three to five seconds, and then come back to the other side. Try and keep your head in a
},
{
    79.6,84.16
     fairly neutral position. Sometimes people kind of go down like that, but then you're just changing
},
{
    84.16,86.96
     the muscle that you're working in stretching. So try
},
{
    86.96,92.36
     and keep that head fairly forward when you side bin. So again just about five on
},
{
    92.36,99.76
     each side just to get it loosened up. After you get those loosened up then
},
{
    99.76,106.36
     you're gonna do a chin tuck. With the chin tuck it's not going downwards, it's tucking it
},
{
    106.36,111.24
     back towards the back of your head. So again you want to keep your head level
},
{
    111.24,116.08
     and you want to just push that chin backwards. So you're making a whole lot
},
{
    116.08,120.32
     of little chins there. But I like using my finger as a target because then you
},
{
    120.32,125.68
     can kind of see how much of a stretch you get. So hold it for about five seconds here
},
{
    125.68,129.28
     and then come back and you can see that now there's a little space between my fingers,
},
{
    129.28,133.44
     which means I'm working those muscles out a little bit. So that forward head movement
},
{
    134.08,141.2
     that you might have then straightens back up. So again, hold it for about five seconds, relax,
},
{
    141.2,146.44
     and do about five of those. So now that you got all those muscles warmed up
},
{
    146.44,150.4
     a little bit, you're gonna go into some stretches. So now you're gonna do an
},
{
    150.4,154.6
     upper trap stretch, which is those muscles in the back up there, those ones
},
{
    154.6,159.96
     that are on the top of that diamond. And what they do is hold everything together.
},
{
    159.96,163.36
     So they get stressed out a lot and they have a lot of tension in them. So if
},
{
    163.36,168.34
     you want to stretch the right side, you're gonna put your right hand underneath your bottom
},
{
    168.34,174.8
     And what that does is it just kind of sets that shoulder and stabilizes it so it doesn't come up while you stretch
},
{
    174.8,182.34
     So just kind of sitting on that arm there take the other hand and then just gently pull your head towards the side
},
{
    182.56,186.12
     Again, you want to keep that head in that kind of neutral position.
},
{
    186.12,187.96
     You don't wanna turn your head.
},
{
    187.96,189.36
     You wanna keep it upright,
},
{
    189.36,193.24
     and then just side bend over towards the other side.
},
{
    193.24,196.76
     So for this, you wanna hold that stretch for 30 seconds,
},
{
    196.76,198.44
     and then do that three times.
},
{
    198.44,201.46
     But if you wanna alternate back and forth,
},
{
    201.46,203.18
     then you can give one side a break.
},
{
    203.18,209.44
     Just make sure you do three on each side for 30 seconds. And I always like to do both sides, even if you just
},
{
    209.44,213.8
     have neck pain on your right side. Doing both sides helps keep those muscles
},
{
    213.8,218.92
     balanced. So the next stretch is for the levator scapulae. What that muscle does
},
{
    218.92,223.76
     is it elevates or lifts the shoulder blades, that scapula. And when we're
},
{
    223.76,228.26
     stressed out, we tend to kind of hunch up our shoulders and overwork that muscle
},
{
    228.26,234.9
     So it gets really tender and irritated and at the attachments up top on the neck and down low at that shoulder blade
},
{
    234.9,239.5
     There's usually those really tender spots that you can push on and we call those trigger points
},
{
    239.5,244.1
     so the way to stretch out that muscle is to take the hand on the side that you want to stretch and
},
{
    244.26,249.44
     Kind of put it on the back of the shoulder blade where your elbow is coming up a little bit. It doesn't
},
{
    249.44,255.04
     have to be super high, but by doing this that helps stabilize and push that scapula down to keep it
},
{
    255.04,261.12
     in one spot while you're stretching. You're going to take the other hand and put it behind your head
},
{
    261.12,265.6
     because when you pull forward it's going to be at about a 45
},
{
    265.6,269.5
     degree angle away. So almost like you're looking at your opposite knee. So it's
},
{
    269.5,273.1
     not straightforward down, it's not straight to the side, it's kind of in
},
{
    273.1,277.22
     that angle. So you're just going to come down this way and you should feel it
},
{
    277.22,281.48
     along that levator muscle right there. So just holding that stretch for about
},
{
    281.48,286.16
     30 seconds, switch sides so then you come up,
},
{
    286.16,290.4
     stabilizing that shoulder blade, and then pulling down towards that opposite knee
},
{
    290.4,296.04
     for 30 seconds, and then doing three on each side. The next set of muscles are
},
{
    296.04,300.28
     your scaling muscles, and those are the muscles in the front there. When those get
},
{
    300.28,304.12
     tight, they can sometimes cause a little bit of nerve pain because the vessels
},
{
    304.12,307.52
     run through those muscles and underneath those muscles, so when they get tight they can sometimes cause a little bit of nerve pain because the vessels run through those muscles and underneath those muscles so when they get
},
{
    307.52,311.96
     tight they can put a lot of pressure on everything. So the way to stretch that is
},
{
    311.96,315.92
     if you want to stretch your right side you're going to take your left hand and
},
{
    315.92,320.0
     place it just above that collarbone kind of on those muscles that's going to
},
{
    320.0,323.72
     kind of help stabilize that collarbone because they're connected there and that
},
{
    323.72,327.56
     clavicle and so you want to keep it stabilized. You're going to turn your head
},
{
    327.56,332.44
     towards that side and then look up towards the ceiling while you're putting
},
{
    332.44,335.96
     a little pressure downwards on that collarbone. So again you're going to hold
},
{
    335.96,342.28
     that for 30 seconds, come back down, switch sides opposite right over there,
},
{
    342.28,346.92
     turn your head and look up, getting that nice stretch
},
{
    346.92,351.88
     through there and doing that three times on each side. The last set of exercises
},
{
    351.88,354.88
     are going to be to strengthen the muscles a little bit, but they're going to
},
{
    354.88,359.8
     be isometric exercises which is you're not actually moving but you're
},
{
    359.8,363.64
     contracting the muscles. So the way to do that is we're going to go back to those
},
{
    363.64,369.0
     motions but we're going to put our hand on our head, so we're not moving our head anymore,
},
{
    369.0,374.2
     but we're pushing into that direction. So for a side bend, you want to put your hand on the side.
},
{
    374.58,377.08
     This is the motion that you're going to do,
},
{
    377.52,380.84
     but you're going to push into your hand so your head's not actually moving.
},
{
    381.28,387.86
     With this, sometimes if your neck is painful, if you push really really hard hard it hurts. So you want to feel tension, you want to feel pressure
},
{
    387.86,390.82
     but you don't want it to be painful. So you might want to start off with just
},
{
    390.82,396.86
     about a 50% push. So pushing into your head and then relaxing. I'm moving my
},
{
    396.86,400.02
     head a little bit just so you can see what I'm doing but you really shouldn't
},
{
    400.02,403.38
     be moving anything. You're pushing into your hand getting that pressure. You
},
{
    403.38,406.76
     might be able to see those muscles activating and then relaxing. So for just
},
{
    406.76,413.0
     about five seconds, push in, relax, and do three on each side. So if you want to
},
{
    413.0,417.72
     alternate back and forth to give one side a break, you can. So pushing in and
},
{
    417.72,427.48
     then coming back. So about three to five seconds and then relax. So then the next one is gonna be that rotation motion.
},
{
    427.48,430.18
     So again, you're doing that movement,
},
{
    430.18,431.24
     but you're not going anywhere.
},
{
    431.24,433.26
     So holding your head again,
},
{
    433.26,436.36
     but now I'm doing that rotational movement
},
{
    436.36,437.42
     pushing into my hand.
},
{
    437.42,441.2
     So again, about three to five seconds,
},
{
    441.2,443.52
     switch sides, turning in that way,
},
{
    443.52,447.4
     three to five seconds, and then doing three on
},
{
    447.4,454.16
     each side. And then the last one is going to be going forward. So again just
},
{
    454.16,457.32
     pushing into your hand but now it's going to be on your forehead. So just kind
},
{
    457.32,461.6
     of put the the bottom of the palm there so it's comfortable and then you're
},
{
    461.6,465.24
     pushing in like you're doing that motion. So
},
{
    465.24,472.38
     again pushing in three to five seconds, relaxing, pushing in three to five
},
{
    472.38,479.64
     seconds three times. Yeah we need a nap after that. Those were your stretches and
},
{
    479.64,482.84
