     Hi guys, I'm Nick from Active Chi Practice and I'm going to show you a few forearm massages
},
{
    6.8,9.16
     for obviously the forearm.
},
{
    9.16,14.92
     Why we would do this for our forearm is because we go through a lot of workouts for example
},
{
    14.92,26.48
     weight lifting, body building, even demanding sports for example tennis or golfing. Okay, not necessarily if you don't train, if you work
},
{
    26.48,32.6
     day-to-day, for example, going on the computer for a long time, gripping a
},
{
    32.6,36.48
     lot of things for a long time, for example, you find that your forearms are getting quite
},
{
    36.48,41.12
     tired from driving, these exercises are for you, the massages are for you.
},
{
    41.12,47.0
     What you need is a lacrosse ball or an empty beer bottle or
},
{
    47.0,53.6
     a bottle full of water. You can put either cold water or warm water in it. To massage
},
{
    53.6,59.08
     the outer portion of your forearm, this is where tennis elbow usually happens. To find
},
{
    59.08,67.2
     the tennis elbow area, wiggle your middle and ring finger like so and you will see the movement around here.
},
{
    67.2,70.48
     Now that's exactly where the muscle tends to ache.
},
{
    70.48,74.84
     Put the lacrosse ball there and go longer, tutorally, up and down.
},
{
    74.84,80.12
     Do about a good 8 to 10 strokes slowly like so.
},
{
    80.12,84.92
     One, two, nine, ten.
},
{
    84.92,86.96
     Have a minute rest and do it again.
},
{
    86.96,92.44
     Now to treat the aprenorosis area where the muscle becomes tendon and attaches to the bone,
},
{
    92.44,97.08
     just go from that area here over here, just closer to the actual elbow itself.
},
{
    97.08,102.36
     Going here, instead of going longitudinally, parallel to the forearm, go side to side.
},
{
    102.36,103.36
     And this is different.
},
{
    103.36,108.12
     You do this for about two minutes, just side to side, transitionally, like so, and that's
},
{
    108.12,110.0
     quite painful right now.
},
{
    110.0,115.56
     This pain here sometimes radiates to the wrist and this mimics a lot of wrist pain, but it's
},
{
    115.56,118.68
     not actually wrist pain, it actually comes from the forearm.
},
{
    118.68,124.6
     Now for the inner part of the forearm, this is where normally people call it golfer's
},
{
    124.6,125.0
     elbow.
},
{
    125.0,129.0
     It happens around here, the muscle bulk is here.
},
{
    129.0,135.0
     To find it just tense, you find that turn your elbow in, tense like so, squeeze that area,
},
{
    135.0,139.0
     put the lacrosse ball there and once again same thing as tennis elbow,
},
{
    139.0,143.0
     longer tunally, 8-10 strokes, nice and slow, heavy ones.
},
{
    143.0,145.98
     This is quite painful for me already.
},
{
    145.98,150.66
     It goes straight into the forearm, sometimes you actually feel the pain in the forearm.
},
{
    150.66,151.66
     Okay?
},
{
    151.66,154.18
     I have about a minute's rest and do it again.
},
{
    154.18,160.1
     Now for the upper neurosis, where the inflammation usually happens, is around here on the elbow,
},
{
    160.1,166.8
     put it there, okay, where the upper neurosis is. Down, transitionally, string it over.
},
{
    166.8,168.2
     There's a lot of adhesions here.
},
{
    168.2,171.48
     This is where the muscle fibers actually stick together
},
{
    171.48,172.8
     and causes a lot of pain.
},
{
    172.8,176.0
     Go side to side, and it happens on all apnea.
},
{
    177.24,180.2
     Over, side to side, two minutes, just like so,
},
{
    180.2,181.12
     nice and quick.
},
{
    182.88,184.96
     If it gets heated up, put some ice on it,
},
{
    184.96,185.72
     and you can do it again.
},
{
    185.72,192.12
     Now if these wrist pains keep occurring please see a physician see a chiropractor
},
{
    192.12,196.72
     and they will give you the right diagnosis. This is only to help muscles spasms.
},
{
    196.72,203.24
     Now you can use a beer bottle as well. I recommend lacrosse ball because it's
},
{
    203.24,208.16
     more specific. You can use a beer bottle just for a bit of relieving paint. Same thing again, long and
},
{
    208.16,213.8
     trunally up and down. Now this bottle it's filled with water reason being if your
},
{
    213.8,219.52
     arm is quite inflamed or quite cold, quite hot sorry, just put this over it. Put a
},
{
    219.52,227.0
     bit of cold water in so it actually gives you relief. Do the same thing.
},
{
    227.0,228.52
     And just over.
},
{
    228.52,234.52
     Now if your pain has been there for a while and you find that warmth helps a little bit
},
{
    234.52,236.88
     more then put warm water in.
},
{
    236.88,240.76
     Don't put hot water because this will explode when you put the cap on it.
},
{
    240.76,242.56
     And that's about it for today guys.
},
{
    242.56,243.88
