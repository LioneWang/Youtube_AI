     Bob and Brad, the two most famous physical therapists
},
{
    6.72,8.04
     on the internet.
},
{
    11.84,13.64
     Howdy folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.
},
{
    13.64,14.96
     Brad Heineck, physical therapist.
},
{
    14.96,17.0
     We are the most famous physical therapists on the internet.
},
{
    17.0,18.48
     In our opinion, of course, Bob.
},
{
    18.48,20.72
     What is causing your shoulder pain?
},
{
    20.72,22.8
     Arthritis, how to tell.
},
{
    22.8,25.94
     So we're gonna go through the symptoms that we believe
},
{
    25.94,30.2
     and signs, objective signs that may indicate
},
{
    30.2,31.8
     that you have arthritis.
},
{
    31.8,34.24
     So pretty common, with shoulder arthritis,
},
{
    34.24,35.92
     I mean, if we bring Sam over here.
},
{
    35.92,37.96
     Bring him over, Sam, let's see what's going on.
},
{
    37.96,42.08
     So you have cartilage that covers the humerus,
},
{
    42.08,45.08
     the ball here, and you also have some here,
},
{
    45.08,48.26
     and you have basically a little thin piece
},
{
    48.26,50.6
     of cartilage going around in there, the labrum.
},
{
    50.6,51.44
     The labrum, yeah.
},
{
    51.44,55.36
     So this kind of over time, it's like Teflon, you know?
},
{
    55.36,57.84
     And you know how Teflon starts to wear off your pan?
},
{
    58.84,59.68
     You know what I mean?
},
{
    59.68,61.2
     Yeah, you should throw your pan away by then.
},
{
    61.2,62.6
     I know, by that time, yeah.
},
{
    62.6,65.64
     It starts to flake and it starts to wear down
},
{
    65.64,68.8
     and eventually you get what is called bone on bone.
},
{
    68.8,70.36
     And that's what you see quite often.
},
{
    70.36,72.56
     Obviously that can hurt.
},
{
    72.56,74.64
     And sometimes when I'm talking about before,
},
{
    74.64,77.8
     you know, you can hear and feel people
},
{
    77.8,79.96
     that have arthritic joints.
},
{
    79.96,81.32
     It's, it can be pretty security.
},
{
    81.32,83.44
     It's really loud on some people.
},
{
    83.44,88.28
     The grinding noise, clicking, cracking.
},
{
    88.28,89.96
     You can also get arthritis by the way,
},
{
    89.96,92.0
     just as a thought here,
},
{
    92.0,94.12
     in the acromioclavicular joint,
},
{
    94.12,96.64
     that's the clavicle or the collar bone,
},
{
    96.64,98.36
     where it attaches over here.
},
{
    98.36,101.56
     And this can give you some pain right in that area too.
},
{
    101.56,104.12
     And so just to let you know, I guess that's on the side.
},
{
    104.12,107.32
     Yeah, I dislocated that, and the doctor said
},
{
    107.32,109.84
     after the last visit is, yeah,
},
{
    109.84,112.0
     you're gonna have arthritis in that joint.
},
{
    112.0,113.76
     Have you felt it yet?
},
{
    113.76,114.6
     No.
},
{
    114.6,115.94
     Here he is, almost sick.
},
{
    115.94,117.12
     It will next year probably.
},
{
    117.12,118.08
     Now that I mentioned it.
},
{
    118.08,119.72
     It'll start up, yeah.
},
{
    119.72,121.96
     You can move that all the way, Brad.
},
{
    121.96,126.4
     So with arthritis, generally you can feel pain
},
{
    126.4,129.28
     in the front, the side, and maybe even the back
},
{
    129.28,130.12
     a little bit.
},
{
    131.0,133.24
     It can refer down the arm a little bit,
},
{
    133.24,135.84
     but it's certainly not gonna go into your forearm
},
{
    135.84,137.48
     or hand or fingers.
},
{
    137.48,141.32
     That would be more of a neck problem or a nerve problem.
},
{
    141.32,144.12
     So I'd say you'd see referral down
},
{
    144.12,147.24
     into this area possibly with arthritis.
},
{
    147.24,150.74
     You may feel more pain when you're pushing
},
{
    150.74,152.28
     or bearing some weight to your arm.
},
{
    152.28,153.8
     Yeah, cause you're grinding it then.
},
{
    153.8,156.44
     Think about it, you're grinding that joint together.
},
{
    156.44,159.58
     So one of the habits that I'm into,
},
{
    159.58,161.76
     which you should try to avoid,
},
{
    161.76,164.44
     is I lean on one arm when I'm reading the paper
},
{
    164.44,165.8
     or eating my cereal or eating. And you're I lean on one arm when I'm reading the paper or eating my cereal
},
{
    165.8,169.54
     or eating and you know, you're really leaning on that arm
},
{
    169.54,172.08
     and it's internally rotated so that's even worse.
},
{
    172.08,174.56
     So you wanna get out of those habits
},
{
    174.56,175.8
     of leaning on to the arm.
},
{
    175.8,178.0
     Some people often lay in bed too,
},
{
    178.0,179.88
     you know, in that propped up position.
},
{
    179.88,180.72
     And their stomach?
},
{
    180.72,181.56
     Yeah.
},
{
    181.56,182.4
     Can I show?
},
{
    182.4,184.12
     Well, it's like when you watch TV when I'm a kid.
},
{
    184.12,185.08
     Yeah, that's what I mean. Some people, I read? Well, it's like when you watch TV when I'm a kid. That's what I mean.
},
{
    185.08,188.24
     Some people, I read like this sometimes in bed.
},
{
    188.24,189.08
     Really?
},
{
    189.08,189.92
     Yep.
},
{
    189.92,190.76
     I guess my neck sore.
},
{
    190.76,192.12
     It's just, well, it's good on my back.
},
{
    192.12,192.96
     So.
},
{
    192.96,194.04
     Oh, I see that.
},
{
    194.04,195.48
     I can't do that one.
},
{
    195.48,199.36
     So, the other thing, if you're lifting a heavy object
},
{
    199.36,201.96
     and the joint is really, you know,
},
{
    201.96,204.52
     grinding together to hold it, or joint in place.
},
{
    204.52,207.32
     Yeah, yep. You could have pain with that.
},
{
    207.32,210.56
     Arthritis, it can start to even hurt at rest
},
{
    210.56,213.16
     if you've been doing a lot during the day.
},
{
    213.16,217.52
     So, but one of the telltale signs I think
},
{
    217.52,222.2
     is that your shoulder becomes limited in motions.
},
{
    222.2,226.16
     And the motion that tends to be limited first
},
{
    226.16,228.6
     and the worst is external rotation.
},
{
    228.6,229.92
     And we're gonna show you how to measure that,
},
{
    229.92,233.0
     but that's basically turning your arms out like this.
},
{
    233.0,237.46
     So that, not out like this, elbow and out like this,
},
{
    237.46,239.36
     that's the one that tends to be most limited.
},
{
    239.36,240.44
     Like some people you'll see
},
{
    240.44,243.04
     they can't even go out like this at all.
},
{
    243.04,245.12
     And this is something you have to actually think about
},
{
    245.12,250.12
     because normally people don't do this and do it real life.
},
{
    250.48,253.92
     It's all part of a complex series of emotions probably.
},
{
    253.92,256.16
     But so we'll show you the way to assess it more.
},
{
    256.16,258.36
     The second one that tends to get limited,
},
{
    258.36,259.78
     not as much as external rotation,
},
{
    259.78,261.82
     but the second in line is abduction.
},
{
    261.82,263.68
     So that's just going up in this direction.
},
{
    263.68,264.96
     And yeah, you'll see a lot of people
},
{
    264.96,267.04
     that kind of go any higher than this.
},
{
    267.04,269.58
     You know, it's not just a matter of getting pain up here.
},
{
    269.58,270.6
     Like they're limited.
},
{
    270.6,271.8
     They hit the wall.
},
{
    271.8,274.16
     It won't go any further.
},
{
    274.16,276.48
     And the last one is shoulder internal rotation,
},
{
    276.48,278.64
     which is basically like this.
},
{
    278.64,281.12
     And we'll show you how to measure all three of these
},
{
    281.12,284.24
     laying down on a flat surface.
},
{
    284.24,286.92
     So. It's the best way to assess it actually.
},
{
    286.92,290.44
     So I'll do that and you can be like the interpreter.
},
{
    290.44,291.28
     Sure.
},
{
    291.28,293.48
     Like, you know how they have interpreters at.
},
{
    293.48,295.76
     Ideally, you know, if we had a camera.
},
{
    295.76,296.96
     A siren which interpreter.
},
{
    296.96,298.84
     Yeah, if we had a camera up here looking down,
},
{
    298.84,301.76
     then you could see it, but I'll be the camera
},
{
    301.76,303.04
     explaining what it looks like.
},
{
    303.04,305.52
     So I have elbows into my side,
},
{
    305.52,307.52
     palms facing each other,
},
{
    307.52,310.3
     and then I'm just gonna let them go out like that.
},
{
    310.3,313.04
     And you're gonna see, is one tighter than the other?
},
{
    313.04,315.56
     Is your painful shoulder tighter than the other?
},
{
    315.56,317.6
     And that might mean that you have some arthritis
},
{
    317.6,318.44
     in the shoulder,
},
{
    318.44,321.08
     because the joint has tightened up on you, the capsule.
},
{
    321.08,323.2
     You may have to have someone else look at you,
},
{
    323.2,324.36
     because it's kind of hard to see,
},
{
    324.36,325.4
     but you know,
},
{
    325.4,327.24
     the distance from-
},
{
    327.24,332.08
     If it's really, you know, a lot,
},
{
    332.08,333.76
     I think you'll be able to pick it out.
},
{
    333.76,335.48
     How's it looked out?
},
{
    335.48,336.8
     You're a little higher on this one.
},
{
    336.8,339.2
     So the distance from this hand down,
},
{
    339.2,341.88
     if the bed came out, is a little higher than this one,
},
{
    341.88,342.92
     but it's pretty close.
},
{
    342.92,345.16
     Now this one, you just put your thumbs up
},
{
    345.16,348.64
     or you can actually put your palms face up
},
{
    348.64,350.36
     and just you're gonna go out to the side like this.
},
{
    350.36,351.4
     I'm gonna run it into the wall here.
},
{
    351.4,354.24
     So he's doing kinda like that snow angel if you're-
},
{
    354.24,355.96
     Now you can see on this one,
},
{
    355.96,357.72
     I have more trouble with this one.
},
{
    357.72,358.56
     Don't you see that Brad?
},
{
    358.56,361.6
     Oh yeah, your right shoulder is tighter than your left.
},
{
    361.6,363.28
     No, my left shoulder.
},
{
    363.28,364.84
     Oh, that's right.
},
{
    364.84,366.56
     My right, your left. No, my left shoulder. Oh, that's right. My right, your left.
},
{
    366.56,368.76
     So definitely in trouble.
},
{
    368.76,370.6
     And I've had issues with that one.
},
{
    370.6,374.2
     I've had a muscle that got paralyzed.
},
{
    374.2,378.0
     So last one is you're gonna actually put your arms out
},
{
    378.0,382.48
     to a T, so straight across, palms forward,
},
{
    382.48,384.8
     and you're just gonna let it rotate forward like that.
},
{
    384.8,387.6
     Yeah. How do I look at this one?
},
{
    387.6,388.44
     Pretty even.
},
{
    388.44,390.84
     From the camera angle, it's a very perfect angle.
},
{
    390.84,394.6
     You can see, do it so it wouldn't be even just to make,
},
{
    394.6,396.28
     so that one's down and this one's up high.
},
{
    396.28,399.08
     That would be, this would be the tight shoulder.
},
{
    399.92,401.56
     So, yep.
},
{
    401.56,404.2
     So that'll give you the idea.
},
{
    404.2,406.56
     With arthritis, we'll be showing you some things
},
{
    406.56,408.0
     you can do for it, but basically,
},
{
    408.0,410.6
     you're trying to regain that motion as much as possible.
},
{
    410.6,412.76
     That's the best thing for it.
},
{
    412.76,413.6
     Thanks for watching.
},
{
    413.6,414.6
     Oh, that's it.
},
{
    414.6,None
     Yeah. you
},
