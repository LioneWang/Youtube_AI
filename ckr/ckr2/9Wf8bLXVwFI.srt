     Viracose veins are swollen blood vessels that appear on the skin as clusters of blue or
},
{
    11.44,13.16
     purple veins.
},
{
    13.16,18.12
     They're sometimes surrounded by spider veins, a group of small blood vessels located near
},
{
    18.12,21.2
     the surface of the skin.
},
{
    21.2,25.0
     Vains have one-way valves that help keep blood flowing toward your heart.
},
{
    25.0,30.0
     If these valves are weak or damaged, blood can back up and pool in your veins.
},
{
    30.0,35.0
     This causes the veins to swell and leads to varicose veins.
},
{
    35.0,41.0
     Varicose veins can appear anywhere, but they often appear on the legs and in the pelvic area.
},
{
    41.0,45.52
     Most varicose veins develop near the surface of the skin.
},
{
    45.52,48.26
     Deeper varicose veins cannot be seen,
},
{
    48.26,51.16
     but they may cause the skin above to swell,
},
{
    51.16,52.8
     become darker, or harden.
},
{
    58.44,61.16
     Symptoms of varicose veins usually appear
},
{
    61.16,64.56
     before the age of 40 and include swollen,
},
{
    64.56,66.24
     twisted clusters of purple
},
{
    66.24,73.08
     or blue veins, swollen legs, ankles and feet, muscle cramps, throbbing, soreness or aching
},
{
    73.08,81.56
     in the legs, legs that feel heavy, soreness behind the knee, itching around the veins,
},
{
    81.56,89.04
     leg muscles that tire easily, brown discoloration of the skin, and skin ulcers.
},
{
    89.04,94.16
     These factors can increase the risk for varicose veins.
},
{
    94.16,98.44
     Varicose veins are four times more common in women than in men.
},
{
    98.44,103.28
     As you get older, there is more wear and tear on the valves in the veins.
},
{
    103.28,106.84
     More weight in the legs increases pressure in the veins.
},
{
    106.84,111.96
     You have a greater chance of developing varicose veins if your parents or other family members
},
{
    111.96,113.38
     had them.
},
{
    113.38,123.12
     Blood does not flow as well in the veins if the person does not get much exercise.
},
{
    123.12,129.06
     Depending on their size and location, varicose and spider veins can be treated with injections
},
{
    129.06,134.26
     known as sclerotherapy or with surgery, including laser surgery.
},
{
    134.26,138.34
     Sclerotherapy is a non-surgical treatment in which a chemical solution is injected
},
{
    138.34,142.68
     into the veins to make them collapse and disappear.
},
{
    142.68,144.78
     Sclerotherapy takes several sessions.
},
{
    144.78,147.08
     One to three injections are usually required
},
{
    147.08,149.68
     to effectively treat any vein.
},
{
    149.68,153.28
     10 to 40 veins may be treated in one session.
},
{
    153.28,156.24
     You will not need anesthesia for sclerotherapy.
},
{
    156.24,158.36
     You will feel no pain during the treatment,
},
{
    158.36,161.92
     though you will feel discomfort from the needle sticks.
},
{
    161.92,164.84
     Temporary reactions to the sclerotherapy
},
{
    164.84,167.76
     might include slight swelling in the leg or foot
},
{
    167.76,172.04
     and minor bruising, itching, redness, or soreness.
},
{
    172.04,177.0
     For two to four weeks after treatment, you will wear medical grade support stockings.
},
{
    177.0,181.08
     Walking and moderate exercise can help speed recovery.
},
{
    181.08,186.0
     Once treated, the veins disappear over a period of six months and do not come back.
},
{
    186.0,192.0
     However, sclerotherapy cannot stop new varicose or spider veins from developing.
},
{

     Photodome therapy is an intense pulsing light for treating small spider veins,

    203.0,205.2
     certain sizes of varicose veins, and
},
{
    205.2,210.2
     vascular birthmarks. Laser therapy heats the blood vessels and makes the vein
},
{
    210.2,215.48
     fade away. Surgical ligation or stripping is surgery in which the dilated
},
{
    215.48,220.46
     vein is removed or tied off through a small incision in the skin. Andovina
},
{
    220.46,226.48
     sublation therapy uses lasers or radio waves delivered through a catheter to create heat
},
{
    226.48,229.16
     to close off a varicose vein.
},
{
    229.16,233.04
     For endoscopic vein surgery, the doctor uses a catheter
},
{
    233.04,235.44
     with a tiny camera and a surgical device
},
{
    235.44,238.24
     at the end of the camera to close the vein.
},
{
    238.24,241.0
     Your doctor will discuss these options with you.
},
{
    249.52,254.32
     Varicose and spider veins might not always need to be treated. However, if veracose veins make walking or standing painful, you should call your doctor
},
{
    254.32,255.72
     for advice.
},
{
    255.72,261.04
     You should also call your doctor if a sore develops on or near a veracose vein, or if
},
{
    261.04,263.36
     your feet or ankles swell.
},
{
    263.36,266.4
     In some cases, veracose veins can be harmful to your
},
{
    266.4,272.56
     health because they might lead to dangerous conditions including venestasis ulcers. These
},
{
    272.56,278.0
     ulcers result when the enlarged vein does not provide enough drainage of fluid from the skin
},
{
    278.0,283.2
     and the skin does not receive enough oxygen. Phlebitis or inflammation of the vein.

     oxygen, phlebitis or inflammation of the vein. Thrombosis are blood clots that form in the dilated vein.
},

    287.92,296.88
     Here are some ways to keep varicose veins from getting worse or coming back.
},
{
    296.88,299.32
     Try to exercise regularly.
},
{
    299.32,301.44
     Stand only when necessary.
},
{
    301.44,304.26
     Elevate your legs while sitting or sleeping.
},
{
    304.26,305.56
     When you need to stand for long
},
{
    305.56,311.28
     periods of time, take frequent breaks to sit down and elevate your feet. And finally,
},
{
    311.28,316.72
     wear special elastic support stockings for extra support and to relieve aching sore legs.
