     So does your sacroiliac or SI joint feel locked up and tight and it just feels like that built-up tension needs to be released?
},
{
    7.22,12.76
     In this video, I'm going to show you how with some really easy movements. Hey everyone, Dr.
},
{
    12.76,20.24
     Rowe here at SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. SI joint strains are a common complaint in my office and these movements
},
{
    20.24,27.46
     I'm going to share with you have helped many of my patients get more motion back in their sacroiliac joints and help eliminate
},
{
    27.62,31.6
     achiness and stiffness around the lower back hips and pelvis.
},
{
    31.6,38.66
     I just want to note that these are for simple strains of the SI joints such as having tightness after a good workout or from work.
},
{
    38.68,43.64
     They should not be used to treat severe pain or major issues like advanced arthritis.
},
{
    44.04,45.24
     Always consult with
},
{
    45.24,49.8
     your local chiropractor or doctor first if you have any questions. The SI joint is
},
{
    49.8,54.24
     the largest synovial or fluid-filled joint in the body. You have two of them,
},
{
    54.24,58.36
     one on the left and one on the right. It's located within the pelvis and it's
},
{
    58.36,63.24
     the Union of the Sacrum and the Ilium. This union is bonded by very strong
},
{
    63.24,66.16
     ligaments which gives this joint a very sturdy
},
{
    66.16,71.28
     support system. It needs this since it helps support the entire weight of the upper body.
},
{
    71.28,76.8
     Also, it aids in shock absorption for the spine and for pelvic movements. Since there's so much
},
{
    76.8,81.92
     being put on the SI joints, it's common that they get overwhelmed and strained. With these stretches,
},
{
    81.92,88.36
     they're going to focus on resetting the SI joints and relieving tightness in the soft tissues around the joint. You may
},
{
    88.36,92.2
     experience a popping or cracking sensation while doing these which is
},
{
    92.2,96.6
     just normal gases within the joint being released very rapidly. This would be
},
{
    96.6,100.28
     similar to a knuckle crack or pop. This should help you have more overall
},
{
    100.28,104.92
     movement in the lower back, less tightness and dull achy pain. So let's get
},
{
    104.92,107.64
     started and get feeling better right now.
},
{
    107.64,109.8
     So I'm going to show you how to reset the SI joint
},
{
    109.8,112.68
     in three really easy movements.
},
{
    112.68,114.96
     What you need to do is find a flat surface.
},
{
    114.96,118.16
     You can do these in bed, on the couch, on the floor,
},
{
    118.16,119.52
     whatever's comfortable for you.
},
{
    119.52,121.0
     It just needs to be flat.
},
{
    121.0,123.64
     So we're gonna start off by bending the knees
},
{
    123.64,128.88
     and then we're gonna bring the legs up just like this, almost like a nice 90 degree angle. From there I'm going to take
},
{
    128.88,134.12
     my hands and place them on the sides of the knees. I'm then going to take the knees and
},
{
    134.12,140.24
     try to drive them outwards while I resist against my hands. What that's going to do
},
{
    140.24,148.96
     is help release tension in that SI joint and you might feel a popping sensation. That's completely normal. Again, that's just the gasses escaping from the joint
},
{
    148.96,152.96
     very rapidly. What I'd like to do is hold this one for short bursts, three to
},
{
    152.96,158.2
     five seconds, kind of relax, and then do them upwards to ten times. The next part
},
{
    158.2,162.16
     is going to be the opposite. We're going to go back into that same position, but
},
{
    162.16,165.08
     what we're going to do instead is squeeze into it.
},
{
    165.08,169.0
     So we're going to take our hands and place them together like that, put them in between
},
{
    169.0,174.96
     the knees, and then drive the knees inwards and resist against it with your hands.
},
{
    174.96,178.0
     Again, you're going to feel a quick tension release.
},
{
    178.0,183.16
     Hold that for about three to five seconds, relax, and then keep doing it upwards to five
},
{
    183.16,184.44
     to ten times.
},
{
    184.44,185.36
     So the next one is my
},
{
    185.36,189.44
     personal favorite. This is a really good way to reset the SI joints. What I'm
},
{
    189.44,194.48
     going to do is this type of motion, but I'm going to resist against it with my
},
{
    194.48,199.56
     hands. So what I'm trying to do is resist against the push and then resist
},
{
    199.56,205.76
     against the pull on the other leg and I just alternate those over and over again.
},
{
    205.76,211.6
     Just very short burst and this is just a really good way to take tension out of the SI joint
},
{
    211.6,212.88
     and reset them.
},
{
    212.88,218.12
     This one I try to do upwards to about 10 times on each side so I would just count to 20.
},
{
    218.12,223.12
     Just 1, 2, 3, all the way up to 20.
