     Oh man, I've got a headache and it feels this big.

    19.32,20.8
     Hey everybody it's Doctor Jo.
},
{
    20.8,28.28
     Today I'm going to show you some simple stretches and exercises if you have a tension headache. Let's get started. To start off you want to just loosen up
},
{
    28.28,32.68
     those neck muscles. You can do some active range of motion, simply just
},
{
    32.68,36.96
     starting like you're turning your head back behind you looking at something
},
{
    36.96,42.12
     behind you. Hold it for about two or three seconds. Come back the other way
},
{
    42.12,47.0
     looking behind you holding it there two to three seconds, coming back.
},
{
    47.0,52.0
     You can do that up to five to ten times, then taking your ear towards your shoulder.
},
{
    52.0,57.0
     Now it's not bringing your shoulder up to your ear, keep your shoulder down if you can.
},
{
    57.0,63.0
     Come down to the side, hold it for about three to five seconds, and then come back the other way.
},
{
    63.0,65.12
     Same thing, hold about three to five
},
{
    65.12,69.32
     seconds, two to three seconds, whatever you can, and do it about five to ten times.
},
{
    69.32,75.04
     Then you want to tuck your chin in towards your chest and then look up
},
{
    75.04,80.2
     towards the ceiling. So same thing, just a couple seconds, hold on each one, going
},
{
    80.2,83.92
     back and forth. That'll loosen up those muscles a little bit. Now if that's not
},
{
    83.92,86.8
     quite enough, if you're not feeling much stretch with that, you can actually then
},
{
    86.8,91.04
     put a little pressure over it. And now you want to hold it for a little bit
},
{
    91.04,96.78
     longer, so maybe about 10 to 15 seconds. And then do each direction. I've got a
},
{
    96.78,101.26
     little pop in my neck. That's a good thing. And then holding it for about 10 to
},
{
    101.26,106.0
     15 seconds. More if you want to, push your chin a little bit to the
},
{
    106.0,112.64
     side. If you have chin problems, you can make your hand do the whole side of the head instead
},
{
    112.64,121.96
     of just the chin, and then back the other way. And probably with up and down you don't
},
{
    121.96,127.36
     really need any pressure for those. The next one is to actually start activating the muscles a little bit.
},
{
    127.36,133.08
     So this is an isometric muscle activation and basically you're just pushing into your
},
{
    133.08,134.08
     hand.
},
{
    134.08,139.04
     So if I was going to look down with my chin, I'm going to put my hand on my forehead and
},
{
    139.04,141.36
     push down like I'm trying to take my chin down.
},
{
    141.36,145.72
     Now you don't want to push super hard, just a little bit to start off with.
},
{
    145.72,148.12
     Hold it about three to five seconds.
},
{
    149.36,151.16
     Do about three of those.
},
{
    151.16,152.32
     And then you can do the same thing,
},
{
    152.32,154.72
     put your hand behind your head and push back.
},
{
    154.72,156.96
     So I'd be doing this motion,
},
{
    156.96,159.36
     but my hand is stopping me from doing that motion.
},
{
    159.36,161.04
     Then I'm pushing into my hand.
},
{
    161.88,163.36
     Then pushing on the side.
},
{
    164.96,167.44
     So I'd be doing that motion and then back
},
{
    167.44,174.84
     the other way and then relaxing and then I'd be turning this way so go in that
},
{
    174.84,182.8
     direction and pushing into my hand about three to five seconds. After you do all
},
{
    182.8,185.8
     that then you can start loosening up the shoulders just a little bit.
},
{
    185.8,191.48
     So you can do shoulder shrugs, about 10 of those coming up and down.
},
{
    191.48,192.84
     Just a little pause at the top.
},
{
    192.84,195.0
     It doesn't have to be too long.
},
{
    195.0,199.6
     And then after those 10, then you can do some circles.
},
{
    199.6,209.62
     10 one way and then reverse it for the Australians going the opposite direction. Then you can do some shoulder squeezes so you're taking your shoulder blades and
},
{
    209.62,214.52
     trying to push them together squeezing in. Hold about three to five seconds for
},
{
    214.52,218.68
     this one and come back doing ten of those. The last one is going to be some
},
{
    218.68,222.76
     chin tucks. I'm going to show you how to do it lying down. Now for the chin tucks
},
{
    222.76,225.72
     roll up a nice squishy towel to give you a target. When for the chin tucks, roll up a nice squishy towel
},
{
    225.72,227.1
     to give you a target.
},
{
    227.1,230.36
     When I say chin tucks, I don't mean bring your chin
},
{
    230.36,231.56
     towards your chest.
},
{
    231.56,234.24
     Actually pushing your chin downwards.
},
{
    234.24,236.36
     So the towel gives you the target to take those
},
{
    236.36,238.54
     neck muscles and push them down.
},
{
    238.54,240.56
     Let your head rest against the ground
},
{
    240.56,242.48
     and you're pushing down that way.
},
{
    242.48,244.92
     So the chin's going down, holding it for about
},
{
    244.92,248.8
     three to five seconds and then coming up, not going down towards your
},
{
    248.8,253.56
     chest. And do that about ten times. Those were some stretches and exercises if
},
{
    253.56,257.04
     you have a tension headache. If you have any questions, leave them in the comment
