     Bob and Brad, the two most famous physical therapists
},
{
    6.68,8.02
     on the internet.
},
{
    9.44,11.28
     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.
},
{
    11.28,12.56
     Brad Heineck, physical therapist.
},
{
    12.56,14.88
     We are the most famous physical therapists on the internet.
},
{
    14.88,16.36
     In our opinion, of course, Bob.
},
{
    16.36,17.96
     Today, my friends, we're gonna show you
},
{
    17.96,21.76
     how to heal golfer's elbow with self massage.
},
{
    21.76,25.42
     So, golfer's elbow is a medical,
},
{
    25.42,28.76
     the medical term for it is meal epicondylitis.
},
{
    28.76,29.6
     Right there.
},
{
    29.6,30.44
     That sounds really fancy doesn't it?
},
{
    30.44,31.34
     Right.
},
{
    31.34,32.88
     So yeah, if you look at the elbow,
},
{
    32.88,34.34
     we've got the bump here.
},
{
    34.34,36.54
     You got a bump here and you got a bump here.
},
{
    36.54,38.1
     That's the inside bump.
},
{
    38.1,40.16
     That's what the medial, medial means that.
},
{
    40.16,41.9
     Epicondyl is the name of that bone.
},
{
    41.9,43.24
     Itis means inflammation.
},
{
    43.24,44.08
     There you go.
},
{
    44.08,44.92
     There you go.
},
{
    44.92,45.74
     Really easy. So to that bone, Itis means inflammation. There you go. There you go. Really easy.
},
{
    45.74,49.76
     So to that bone, coming to the bone is a tendon
},
{
    49.76,51.76
     which attaches a bunch of,
},
{
    51.76,53.16
     oh sorry, go the wrong way.
},
{
    54.64,57.34
     A bunch of these forearm muscles attach to this bone
},
{
    57.34,59.52
     through a heavy tendon here.
},
{
    59.52,62.84
     Now when these muscles are being overused,
},
{
    62.84,67.0
     like in golf, which it's never possible to play too much golf, but if they're being overused, like in golf, which is never possible to play too much golf.
},
{
    67.0,68.88
     But if they're being overused,
},
{
    68.88,71.68
     they can start to develop maybe minor tears
},
{
    71.68,73.72
     and inflammation in that tendon.
},
{
    73.72,76.76
     And it gets to the point where it really hurts.
},
{
    76.76,77.68
     And you can't do anything.
},
{
    77.68,79.36
     Now you had tennis level, right?
},
{
    79.36,81.92
     Yeah, I've had this too, but that's near so bad.
},
{
    81.92,82.76
     Sure.
},
{
    82.76,84.52
     I don't golf, you know,
},
{
    84.52,88.12
     so you don't, it can get it from a lot of different activities.
},
{
    88.12,91.8
     Any, like with tennis elbow, it's more extension activities
},
{
    91.8,93.64
     and with golf, it's more flexion actually.
},
{
    93.64,94.88
     Sure, right.
},
{
    94.88,97.48
     So it can be very tender.
},
{
    98.6,102.76
     You know, the approach that we take is that
},
{
    102.76,106.48
     there's some scar tissue in there that is trying to heal.
},
{
    106.48,109.0
     So we wanna get more blood flow over the area.
},
{
    109.0,111.64
     And we may even try to realign those fibers
},
{
    111.64,113.4
     according to James Sirrex,
},
{
    113.4,115.4
     the father of orthopedic medicine.
},
{
    115.4,117.68
     So this is the technique he came up with.
},
{
    117.68,120.52
     So we're gonna do cross fiber friction massage.
},
{
    120.52,124.52
     You can take your fingers and put one by the other
},
{
    124.52,126.74
     or you can put one on top of the other
},
{
    126.74,129.72
     and you're gonna go right and find that tender spot.
},
{
    129.72,132.18
     Usually you off the bone a little bit
},
{
    132.18,134.7
     and go in right over the tendon.
},
{
    134.7,137.46
     And you'll know if you get on the really tender spot,
},
{
    137.46,139.26
     it's just gonna hurt like a dick.
},
{
    139.26,141.02
     And so you need to get away from it.
},
{
    141.02,142.1
     Get away from it a little bit.
},
{
    142.1,144.1
     And go this direction more towards you,
},
{
    144.1,145.24
     more on the muscle.
},
{
    145.24,147.96
     Now Brad's using the thumb there, which would work
},
{
    147.96,149.28
     for the angle.
},
{
    149.28,150.9
     You can also use the fingers.
},
{
    150.9,154.64
     Now you're going to really dig in fairly deep.
},
{
    154.64,157.08
     And the fibers run this way.
},
{
    157.08,159.12
     So you're going to go across the fiber.
},
{
    159.12,163.28
     That's what it's called, a cross fiber friction massage.
},
{
    163.28,164.92
     Blind some friction there.
},
{
    164.92,167.6
     So you start massaging and in fact,
},
{
    167.6,171.8
     after 30 seconds to 60 seconds, it's just too tender.
},
{
    171.8,174.52
     It just keeps getting worse and worse and worse.
},
{
    174.52,177.4
     In that case, I'm gonna have you try massage number two
},
{
    177.4,179.24
     and I'll show that to you in a minute.
},
{
    179.24,182.48
     But let's say it starts to plateau the pain
},
{
    182.48,187.7
     and maybe even gets a little bit better. Then you can continue for up to 15 minutes now
},
{
    187.7,193.92
     We recommend because that's such a long time that maybe you want to split it up to three times a day for five minutes
},
{
    193.92,195.92
     Your fingers or your thumb will wear out right
},
{
    196.56,200.32
     Either that or you're gonna get some kind of itus in the hand
},
{
    200.32,203.16
     Yeah, you're gonna have really sore fingers and we'll show you an alternative for that
},
{
    203.16,206.64
     Brad wanted to show that right now? That you can use a massage gun.
},
{
    206.64,207.48
     Yep.
},
{
    207.48,209.68
     So let's take, well this one,
},
{
    209.68,211.6
     cause you have a round head actually works good.
},
{
    211.6,214.08
     You know, there's different types of heads.
},
{
    214.08,216.52
     Yeah, you can, I don't know if you can see those.
},
{
    216.52,217.36
     Well, that was good.
},
{
    217.36,218.92
     Black on black.
},
{
    218.92,221.92
     They come in the kit with the massage gun.
},
{
    221.92,224.28
     So we'll get this moving here.
},
{
    224.28,225.64
     And you need, when you get a gun,
},
{
    225.64,229.74
     they reciprocate or they travel percuss,
},
{
    229.74,232.82
     in one direction, you're not gonna go into it this way.
},
{
    232.82,235.54
     That is just gonna make it really inflamed and sore
},
{
    235.54,236.54
     and be painful.
},
{
    236.54,238.64
     So you turn the gun sideways
},
{
    238.64,241.4
     and you may wanna start more on the muscle belly
},
{
    241.4,244.34
     and you work your way closer to the area.
},
{
    244.34,246.72
     And you know, you can have a little pain with it
},
{
    246.72,250.2
     but like Bob said, after 30 seconds or a little more
},
{
    250.2,253.2
     it should plateau or even start to feel better
},
{
    253.2,255.6
     and then you can move a little closer.
},
{
    255.6,258.16
     So you gotta find that happy medium
},
{
    258.16,261.44
     but if it's just too painful and it hurts
},
{
    261.44,262.8
     and it's getting worse,
},
{
    262.8,264.8
     then you gotta back up and get into the muscle belly.
},
{
    264.8,266.84
     Yeah, get into the muscle belly, work the belly
},
{
    266.84,269.36
     and see if you can loosen up that belly.
},
{
    269.36,270.72
     I'm gonna show you one other thing you can do
},
{
    270.72,273.68
     on a tendon too, but that would definitely be something
},
{
    273.68,276.2
     you can do, and that you can go directly into right Brad.
},
{
    276.2,277.44
     Yep, then you can work it.
},
{
    277.44,279.6
     And the idea is if you get the tightness
},
{
    279.6,282.72
     out of the muscle belly, it'll take stress
},
{
    282.72,283.56
     off where the injury is.
},
{
    283.56,284.68
     Yeah, well, pull us hard on that.
},
{
    284.68,285.52
     There you go. Yeah. So, pull us hard on that. There you go.
},
{
    285.52,288.92
     So, the other thing you can try is,
},
{
    288.92,291.76
     if it's just really tender over the tendon yet,
},
{
    291.76,294.04
     you can actually put your thumb right on it.
},
{
    294.04,296.94
     This is a McKenzie technique, Robin McKenzie.
},
{
    296.94,299.44
     Just put your thumb on it and squeeze it a little bit,
},
{
    299.44,301.88
     and then you're gonna bend the wrist
},
{
    301.88,304.36
     and do this just 10 times.
},
{
    304.36,307.08
     So with your thumb, you can feel the muscles contract.
},
{
    307.08,309.28
     You can feel the tendon.
},
{
    309.28,311.12
     I'm right on the tendon.
},
{
    311.12,315.56
     And this is just to start preparing the tendon
},
{
    315.56,316.78
     for some pressure.
},
{
    318.52,321.52
     And a lot of times that pressure, it actually feels good.
},
{
    321.52,322.36
     Right.
},
{
    322.36,323.4
     You know, if it's not too tender,
},
{
    323.4,326.94
     depending on, you know, you just adjust the low position.
},
{
    326.94,329.96
     So in essence, you know, the fallback position
},
{
    329.96,332.4
     is you work on the muscle belly.
},
{
    332.4,333.24
     Sure, yep.
},
{
    333.24,335.44
     And you can always almost always do that.
},
{
    335.44,339.16
     And that'll again, take more pressure off the tendon itself.
},
{
    340.16,343.6
     And the massage gun will save your hands
},
{
    343.6,348.62
     and maybe save your marriage if your spouse needs it done.
},
{
    348.76,349.6
     So.
},
{
    349.6,351.8
     You could actually even use the balls on that
},
{
    351.8,353.44
     if you didn't have a gun or whatever.
},
{
    353.44,355.88
     You could roll your forearm on there
},
{
    355.88,359.56
     or you could roll the ball on the forearm.
},
{
    359.56,363.04
     So you can't do cross fiber with these though.
},
{
    363.04,363.88
     No.
},
{
    363.88,364.72
     That really wouldn't work.
},
{
    364.72,366.92
     But it does get in and it gives some relief.
},
{
    366.92,369.24
     Brad, I'm gonna show a little bit of a bonus here.
},
{
    369.24,371.96
     Just some forearm stretches you can do to help.
},
{
    371.96,375.98
     Sometimes with a forearm problem.
},
{
    375.98,378.74
     Now you can first tell whether or not your forearm
},
{
    378.74,381.08
     is tight with pronation supination.
},
{
    381.08,381.92
     Sure.
},
{
    381.92,385.92
     By you first put your hands, pull up,
},
{
    385.92,388.8
     and if you put a ruler across your wrist,
},
{
    388.8,391.16
     they should be nearly level.
},
{
    392.04,393.84
     Now the other way, the same thing.
},
{
    393.84,395.92
     They should be nearly level.
},
{
    395.92,398.28
     If you find one that's like this,
},
{
    398.28,400.08
     and the other one's all the way down,
},
{
    400.08,402.68
     this one needs a lot of stretching.
},
{
    402.68,405.14
     So what you're gonna do is you're gonna bring it up
},
{
    405.14,408.16
     and you can stretch it this way
},
{
    409.66,410.8
     with a palm away from you
},
{
    410.8,413.26
     and you can stretch it palm toward you.
},
{
    413.26,415.42
     So the elbows bent all the way?
},
{
    415.42,417.88
     Elbows bent, you're into your side.
},
{
    417.88,418.72
     Yep, right there.
},
{
    418.72,421.28
     You're stretching it palm out.
},
{
    421.28,422.8
     You're stretching it palm in.
},
{
    422.8,424.08
     So you're not grabbing the hand,
},
{
    424.08,427.4
     you're grabbing the wrist. The wrist and try to get a good hold of that.
},
{
    427.4,429.72
     So I'll show you on the left side now.
},
{
    429.72,430.64
     I'm gonna grab the wrist,
},
{
    430.64,434.92
     I'm gonna take it palm out and then take it palm in.
},
{
    436.8,437.76
     There we go.
},
{
    437.76,440.92
     Yep, so we got flat here and it's down there.
},
{
    440.92,445.12
     Yep, and if you're lacking motion,
},
{
    445.12,447.6
     that elbow and the tendon
},
{
    447.6,449.68
     need to take up the extra motion
},
{
    449.68,450.88
     and they're gonna work harder.
},
{
    450.88,454.44
     It's just as simple as physics, I guess it would be, Brad.
},
{
    454.44,455.88
     Yep, physics, mechanics.
},
{
    455.88,457.24
     Yep, biomechanics.
},
{
    457.24,458.08
     There you go.
},
{
    458.08,460.32
     So, all right.
},
{
    460.32,461.16
     Thanks for watching.
},
{
    461.16,462.0
     That's it?
},
{
    462.0,462.82
     Yeah, that's it.
},
{
    462.82,463.66
     Oh, excellent.
},
{
    463.66,465.32
     Well, what about, are we gonna? No. Oh, we'll do on the next one. Okay. That's it? Yeah, that's it. Oh, excellent. Well, what about, are we gonna?
},
{
    465.32,466.16
     Oh, we'll do on the next one.
},
{
    466.16,467.0
     Oh, okay.
},
{
    467.0,467.84
     Just a surprise.
},
