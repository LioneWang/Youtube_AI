     Welcome back everyone. Today I'm going to show you some stretches for the neck. It could
},
{
    5.04,9.56
     alleviate a lot of pain in the neck, in the head and in the shoulders. It could also prevent
},
{
    9.56,14.76
     you from degenerative change, for example arthritis, especially in the lower neck around
},
{
    14.76,20.56
     the cervical thoracic junction. It also can improve your posture as well, especially if
},
{
    20.56,24.88
     you spend a lot of time driving or you spend a lot of time at your desk. When you spend
},
{
    24.88,29.84
     a lot of time in this position, your head usually is forward and it causes a lot
},
{
    29.84,35.2
     of strain around this area in the cervical thoracic junction, also known as the lower neck.
},
{
    35.76,41.2
     And this area can then get a lot of degenerative change, for example arthritis or bonus spur
},
{
    41.2,45.6
     growth and could be impinging on the structures around it, for example, nerves in this area,
},
{
    45.6,48.6
     causing radiation of pain down the arms.
},
{
    48.6,54.9
     Now, the muscles in the neck can also squeeze on vulnerable structures, for example,
},
{
    54.9,61.0
     the arteries and veins that run into your neck, and also the nerves that come out of the neck down into the arms.
},
{
    61.0,70.0
     And therefore, you may feel pain not only in the neck, but also down the arm arm as well that replicate a lot of numbness and tingling running down the arms. There will be
},
{
    70.0,76.0
     some nerves that come from the upper neck and into the head for example the great dog single nerve
},
{
    76.0,82.16
     and that muscle can cause a lot of pain and headaches around this area as well. So by doing
},
{
    82.16,88.44
     these stretches it will definitely alleviate a lot of pain but also prevent a lot of pain and prevent a lot of
},
{
    88.44,91.4
     disorder change and improve your posture in the long run. I hope these
},
{
    91.4,96.44
     stretches help you as much as they help me and my patients.
},
{
    97.48,103.16
     Side tilts. To do a side tilt stretch just lean your head to the side. Try to
},
{
    103.16,105.32
     touch your ear to your shoulder.
},
{
    105.32,111.68
     Hold the position when you start feeling the stretch for 30 seconds or 10 long breaths.
},
{
    111.68,118.36
     And repeat this on both sides 4-5 times. Try not to tilt your head in rotation. This will
},
{
    118.36,122.92
     place your neck in extension instead. Just look straight ahead when you do the head tilt
},
{
    122.92,129.68
     stretch. This mainly stretches the upper trapezius muscle, which is attached to the base of the head to the cervical spine
},
{
    129.68,135.6
     and inserts into your shoulders and your upper back. It also stretches some of the scalene muscles
},
{
    135.6,141.04
     which can get tight from stress or poor breathing patterns. To enhance the stretch,
},
{
    141.04,148.1
     place your hand on the side of your head and pull it down. Another common mistake people tend to do is to over exert themselves by tensing up the
},
{
    148.1,154.22
     neck or the shoulder muscles or raise their shoulder to cheat to touch their ear.
},
{
    154.22,158.7
     By doing this it will cause you to take shorter breaths and tighten your scaling muscles which
},
{
    158.7,164.5
     are the muscles that tend to cause thoracic outlet syndrome and radiate pain and tingling
},
{
    164.5,165.16
     down the arm.
},
{
    165.16,169.0
     If you still don't feel a stretch, you can grab the side of the chair and anchor your
},
{
    169.0,170.0
     shoulder down.
},
{
    170.0,175.0
     Or, if you're sitting on a couch or a bed, you can anchor your arm down by sitting on
},
{
    175.0,179.52
     the back side of your hand with your little finger facing towards your knee.
},
{
    179.52,184.8
     Then with the other hand, place it on the side of your head and press lightly with your fingertips,
},
{
    184.8,188.96
     pulling the side of your head and press lightly with your fingertips, pulling the side of the head down. The more relaxed your shoulder and your neck
},
{
    188.96,193.6
     muscles are, the more you will feel the stretch. Take advantage of the weight of
},
{
    193.6,198.8
     your head and your shoulders to enhance the stretch. Forward and backward tilts.
},
{
    198.8,205.54
     Start in a seated position with your head squarely over your shoulders and your back
},
{
    205.54,206.54
     straight.
},
{
    206.54,212.64
     Lower your chin towards your chest, bring your neck into flexion and hold this position
},
{
    212.64,215.0
     for 30 seconds.
},
{
    215.0,221.12
     Relax and slowly lift your head back up again, tilting your chin up towards the ceiling.
},
{
    221.12,223.88
     Bring your head back into extension.
},
{
    223.88,226.68
     Hold this for another 30 seconds. Repeat this
},
{
    226.68,233.24
     back and forth 4 to 5 times. When you bring your head into extension, it will
},
{
    233.24,238.54
     stretch the front neck muscles such as the scaling muscles and squeeze the
},
{
    238.54,242.92
     neck muscles in the back such as the upper trapezius muscles. By bending your
},
{
    242.92,250.32
     head forward, it will switch off the muscles on the back of the neck, such as the upper trapezius muscles. This will promote
},
{
    250.32,255.88
     voluntary control over your neck muscles to reduce spasming in the upper trapezius muscles.
},
{
    255.88,260.9
     Although the purpose of this exercise is to stretch the neck muscles, it will also promote
},
{
    260.9,270.04
     flexion and extension in the cervical spine. This will introduce lubrication in the fensette joints in the cervical spine and rehydration of the
},
{
    270.04,273.76
     intervertebral discs between the vertebrae of your cervical spine.
},
{
    273.76,278.72
     Therefore allowing better function for nerves veins and arteries in the neck.
},
{
    278.72,283.6
     Neck rotation. Keep your head squarely over your shoulders and your back
},
{
    283.6,285.14
     straight. Slowly turn
},
{
    285.14,289.0
     your head towards your shoulder until you feel a stretch on the side of the neck and
},
{
    289.0,293.8
     shoulder. Hold this stretch for 30 seconds and then slowly turn your head to the other
},
{
    293.8,298.62
     side. This is a good way to assess if the range of motion in your neck is asymmetrical
},
{
    298.62,302.8
     compared to the other side. This is usually presented when you rotate your head and your
},
{
    302.8,306.54
     chin cannot reach as close to your shoulder compared to the other side.
},
{
    306.54,310.94
     This could mean that there could be tightness in the opposing muscles in the neck, or the
},
{
    310.94,314.5
     joints in the cervical spine are stiff and fixated.
},
{
    314.5,318.98
     By doing these type of exercises, it will promote movement in the neck again and prevent
},
{
    318.98,322.42
     the generic change in the future, such as arthritis.
},
{
    322.42,327.08
     You can also add some pressure on the side of the chin in a controlled manner to passively
},
{
    327.08,329.48
     move the neck further in rotation.
},
{
    329.48,335.0
     A research paper was published on the effects of neck exercises on cervical genic headache,
},
{
    335.0,337.56
     which is headaches that are caused from the neck.
},
{
    337.56,339.96
     The study was done on three groups of people.
},
{
    339.96,343.24
     Group 1 was only doing neck strengthening exercises.
},
{
    343.24,345.8
     Group 2 was doing neck strengthening exercises. Group two was doing neck strengthening exercises
},
{
    345.8,347.5
     and stretching exercises.
},
{
    347.5,351.8
     And group three only did neck stretching exercises.
},
{
    351.8,354.8
     The results showed that group two got the most pain relief
},
{
    354.8,359.28
     from upper extremity pain by doing both neck exercises
},
{
    359.28,360.64
     and neck stretches.
},
{
    360.64,362.58
     So I highly recommend watching
},
{
    362.58,365.28
     and trying the deep neck exercise video I made.
},
{
    365.28,370.2
     I'll put a link in the description box below if not at the end of this video.
},
{
    370.2,375.88
     By doing neck strengthening and neck exercises you'll get much better results.
},
{
    375.88,377.64
     Lavaida scapula stretch.
},
{
    377.64,381.3
     To stretch the Lavaida scapula muscle, turn your head away from the side you're trying
},
{
    381.3,382.3
     to stretch.
},
{
    382.3,385.92
     Now, with your free hand, pull the back of your head down.
},
{
    385.92,388.68
     Try to tuck your nose towards your armpit,
},
{
    388.68,390.74
     as if you're trying to smell your armpit.
},
{
    390.74,392.04
     If you still don't feel a stretch,
},
{
    392.04,393.44
     you can grab the side of your chair
},
{
    393.44,395.4
     to anchor your shoulder down.
},
{
    395.4,398.44
     Or, if you're sitting on a couch or your bed,
},
{
    398.44,399.88
     you can anchor your arm down
},
{
    399.88,401.82
     by sitting on the backside of your hand
},
{
    401.82,408.6
     with your little finger facing towards the back of your knee. The levator scap muscle is a muscle that helps elevate the shoulder
},
{
    408.6,412.84
     blade. It inserts on the upper portion of your cervical spine which is your neck
},
{
    412.84,418.28
     and attaches to the superior border of the scapula which is your shoulder blade.
},
{
    418.28,422.84
     Once again try to do this stretch in a relaxed and controlled manner. Try not to
},
{
    422.84,425.2
     tense up your shoulder or even over exert
},
{
    425.2,430.16
     yourself whilst pulling your neck over. The more you relax your shoulder and neck muscles, the more
},
{
    430.16,435.28
     you will feel a stretch. Take advantage of the weight of your head and your shoulders to enhance
},
{
    435.28,441.12
     the stretch. Advance levator scapula stretch. Raise the arm on the side that you're trying to stretch
},
{
    441.12,445.16
     forward and reach over the back with your hand grasping
},
{
    445.16,450.48
     the shoulder blade and applying a downwards pressure on the spine of the shoulder blade.
},
{
    450.48,456.12
     This will rotate the shoulder blade downwards which helps lengthen the levator scapula muscle
},
{
    456.12,458.52
     even more before it's stretched.
},
{
    458.52,462.0
     Turn your head away from the side you are trying to stretch.
},
{
    462.0,467.44
     Now with your free hand grab the back of your head and pull your head down so that your nose
},
{
    467.44,469.72
     is tucked into your armpit.
},
{
    469.72,472.28
     Hold this position when you feel a good stretch
},
{
    472.28,473.52
     behind your neck.
},
{
    473.52,475.8
     This is quite an advanced stretch
},
{
    475.8,477.44
     because to perform it correctly,
},
{
    477.44,479.88
     you'll need the right coordination to execute it.
},
{
    479.88,482.8
     However, this stretch is highly effective
},
{
    482.8,489.9
     because when you raise your elbow up on the same side that you're stretching, it would deactivate the levator scapula muscle, allowing
},
{
    489.9,494.84
     it to lengthen further from its attachment from the neck to the shoulder.
},
{
    494.84,501.08
     Hold this stretch for about 30 seconds or 10 deep long breaths and repeat it on both
},
{
    501.08,503.88
     sides 4 to 5 times.
},
{
    503.88,505.8
