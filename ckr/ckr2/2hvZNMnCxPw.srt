     In this video, I'm going to show you an easy way to fix pain from a cervical herniated disc.
},
{
    5.04,5.76
     Stay tuned.
},
{
    10.72,17.12
     Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe here at Spine Cure in St. Joseph, Michigan. So let's go over a very good
},
{
    17.12,23.52
     conservative way to help relieve pain from a cervical herniated disc causing a pinched nerve
},
{
    23.52,26.26
     in the neck. And that is traction.
},
{
    26.26,28.12
     If you're unfamiliar with traction,
},
{
    28.12,29.4
     this is how it works.
},
{
    29.4,30.72
     So if we had x-ray vision,
},
{
    30.72,32.46
     this is what our spine would look like.
},
{
    32.46,35.08
     You have bone or the vertebra that comprise it,
},
{
    35.08,37.96
     but you also have spacers in between those bones.
},
{
    37.96,39.8
     Those are the spinal discs.
},
{
    39.8,41.72
     Think of them as like a shock absorber.
},
{
    41.72,43.2
     So when you do activities,
},
{
    43.2,47.72
     you get into an injury or a fall. These are what take a lot of stress out of that. Like a shock absorber, so when you do activities, you get into an injury or a fall, these are what take a lot of stress out of that.
},
{
    47.72,52.0
     Like a shock absorber though, they can get compressed and overwhelmed.
},
{
    52.0,56.56
     When this gets compressed, what happens is it starts to bulge off to the side.
},
{
    56.56,59.16
     If it gets bad enough, it can actually herniate.
},
{
    59.16,65.68
     A bulging disc pinches the nerve and that's when you start to get traveling pains down into the
},
{
    65.68,66.68
     arm.
},
{
    66.68,70.78
     So why traction is so great is because it's a pulling motion.
},
{
    70.78,75.52
     So think if this is getting pancaked and compressed, what do we want to do?
},
{
    75.52,76.96
     Exactly, pull on it.
},
{
    76.96,80.44
     If we can pull on it, what we're going to do is create a negative pressure right here,
},
{
    80.44,86.36
     bring that bulging material back in towards the center, off the nerve, and get a lot of pain relief,
},
{
    86.36,89.36
     and hopefully a lot less symptoms that are traveling.
},
{
    89.36,91.2
     So let's give this a try,
},
{
    91.2,93.36
     and get you feeling a lot better right now.
},
{
    93.36,96.52
     So how we're going to do this at home neck traction
},
{
    96.52,99.18
     is with an everyday hand-drying towel.
},
{
    99.18,101.8
     This is very easy, and can give you pain relief
},
{
    101.8,104.0
     in as little as 30 seconds.
},
{
    104.0,104.88
     So with the first step,
},
{
    104.88,107.38
     I'm just gonna place the towel on on my neck and I'm going to
},
{
    107.38,111.8
     grab the two ends and I'm going to pull it forward until I feel a good stretch and a
},
{
    111.8,113.76
     little bit of pressure into my neck.
},
{
    113.76,117.22
     The next part is building extension into the neck.
},
{
    117.22,122.12
     That is bringing our head backwards like this while I keep pulling on it with the towel.
},
{
    122.12,125.72
     It should make it actually feel better with this amount of traction.
},
{
    125.72,127.88
     Do not go to the point of discomfort.
},
{
    127.88,130.2
     So the next part, we're going to lift up
},
{
    130.2,133.56
     on the ends right here to even get more traction
},
{
    133.56,135.56
     into the neck and I'm really gonna try to focus
},
{
    135.56,138.16
     on bringing my head back as much as I can.
},
{
    138.16,141.24
     This should make your neck feel better.
},
{
    141.24,143.2
     It should not make it feel worse.
},
{
    143.2,146.12
     If it is making it feel worse, discontinue
},
{
    146.12,150.2
     immediately and instead go to your local doctor or chiropractor to get a taken
},
{
    150.2,155.72
     look at. So with this I'm going to hold this for about 15 to 30 seconds. I'm going
},
{
    155.72,160.88
     to then relax and then repeat about three to five times. When you do this also
},
{
    160.88,164.88
     you should get what's called centralization of symptoms. So if you
},
{
    164.88,169.8
     have a cervical herniated disc into the neck that's causing a pinched nerve, you're
},
{
    169.8,174.88
     going to get radiating or traveling pains, possibly from the shoulder into the elbow.
},
{
    174.88,177.44
     If it's bad enough, it can go into the fingers.
},
{
    177.44,182.24
     With traction, when you pull on it, it's going to relieve that pressure into the spinal
},
{
    182.24,184.68
     disc off that herniation.
},
{
    184.68,185.92
     You'll notice that symptoms should start to come back up to the starting point into the spinal disc off that herniation and you'll notice that symptom
},
{
    185.92,190.88
     should start to come back up to the starting point in the neck. So if you're not feeling as much
},
{
    190.88,196.24
     traveling pain, this is working for you and keep it up. So if you are having one-sided pains that
},
{
    196.24,201.28
     are traveling down, this is how we're going to take this to the next level and really focus on
},
{
    201.28,205.12
     centralizing that pain. So with this stretch, what we're going to do
},
{
    205.12,207.7
     is crisscross our arms like this.
},
{
    207.7,210.08
     I'm going to pull on it just like before,
},
{
    210.08,211.82
     but I'm going to keep one end locked
},
{
    211.82,215.24
     while the other one goes up 45 degrees towards the ceiling.
},
{
    215.24,217.2
     It's almost like you're trying to take this towel
},
{
    217.2,219.32
     towards your eye on that side.
},
{
    219.32,221.36
     Keep pulling on it just like this.
},
{
    221.36,223.72
     And what you're going to feel is that one side
},
{
    223.72,229.36
     really starts to open up. And you want to go at an angle and just enough traction in
},
{
    229.36,235.18
     there to hopefully start to get that to come back up. Try it on both sides. When
},
{
    235.18,238.88
     you find a spot that is offering you the most amount of pain relief, that's the
},
{
    238.88,242.92
     one that you're going to want to focus on. When you find that spot, hold it for
},
{
    242.92,245.58
     15 to 30 seconds, relax, do it three
},
{
    245.58,249.44
     to five times. I really do hope that it's going to give you a lot of centralization
},
{
    249.44,253.68
     and a lot less symptoms traveling. So give it a try. I hope this helps. So if you like
