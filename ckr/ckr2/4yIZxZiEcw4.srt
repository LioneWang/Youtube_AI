     So I want to talk today about how you should really treat a broken toe and the reason I
},
{
    4.12,8.72
     want to talk about that is because today I had the third patient this week who came
},
{
    8.72,12.72
     in complaining of months of pain after stubbing their toe.
},
{
    12.72,15.52
     So here's the foot, here's the toes.
},
{
    15.52,19.08
     Most common toe to injure is usually this little one over here but you can injure any
},
{
    19.08,20.08
     of them.
},
{
    20.08,23.48
     Most commonly injure it because you stub it on something.
},
{
    23.48,25.98
     It's actually pretty easy to fracture these toes.
},
{
    25.98,31.34
     The problem is most people who stub their toes end up going to an emergency room or
},
{
    31.34,35.98
     an urgent care center or sometimes their primary care doctor's office and they're told to simply
},
{
    35.98,37.9
     tape their toes together.
},
{
    37.9,39.54
     And that's called buddy taping.
},
{
    39.54,47.04
     And what you do is you take a piece of tape and you essentially tape the toes together. The problem here is that does
},
{
    47.04,52.72
     absolutely nothing to stop the toes from moving. So now you have a fracture but it continues to move
},
{
    52.72,58.72
     and so weeks and months later it's still causing a lot of pain and a lot of swelling. Even though
},
{
    58.72,63.76
     it's just a toe and even though it's very small there's really only one way that you can properly
},
{
    63.76,67.5
     treat a broken toe and that is to immobilize it.
},
{
    67.5,71.94
     What that means is whenever you break a bone, big or small, you have to stop the motion
},
{
    71.94,74.86
     at the joints on either side of that bone.
},
{
    74.86,81.02
     So this may seem like overkill, but the only way to really treat a broken toe is with this,
},
{
    81.02,82.32
     a big walking boot.
},
{
    82.32,86.4
     Now a lot of people think I'm a little crazy when I say this because it just looks so big
},
{
    86.4,88.84
     to treat this little broken toe right here.
},
{
    88.84,92.52
     But the problem is not only do you have the motion here,
},
{
    92.52,95.16
     but you've got tendons that start in your leg
},
{
    95.16,96.4
     and go down into your toe,
},
{
    96.4,98.2
     and those cause motion of the toe.
},
{
    98.2,100.68
     So a taller walking boot like this
},
{
    100.68,103.8
     is the only way that you can actually stop the motion
},
{
    103.8,105.6
     of those tendons and stop the
},
{
    105.6,109.92
     motion of the foot because this boot has what's called a rocker on it. So it prevents you from
},
{
    109.92,115.28
     moving it. So getting into this boot as soon as possible is the best way to treat it. First of
},
{
    115.28,120.32
     all, if you do stub your toe, I highly recommend you try not to treat this yourself. Go see a doctor,
},
{
    120.32,125.12
     get an x-ray, but then make sure you get a walking boot. You can find more information
},
{
    125.12,129.36
     on how to treat a broken toe on our website. Just do a search for broken toe. If you have
},
{
    129.36,134.12
     no ability to see a doctor, you can actually find recommendations on the types of walking
},
{
    134.12,139.52
     boots you can use there. But otherwise, again, get an x-ray and see someone about it. But
},
{
    139.52,144.04
     get into a walking boot. Don't let them tape your toes together to try and treat a broken

     toe.
