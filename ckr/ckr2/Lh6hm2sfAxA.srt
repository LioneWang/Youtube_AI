     In this video, I'm going to show you how to fix rounded shoulders at home using no special
},
{
    4.68,5.68
     equipment.
},
{
    5.68,6.68
     Stay tuned.
},
{
    6.68,7.68
     Hey, everyone.
},
{
    7.68,14.72
     Dr. Rowe from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan.
},
{
    14.72,18.44
     In this video, we're going to deal with unsightly forward-rounded posture.
},
{
    18.44,21.68
     It's usually caused by what is known as upper cross syndrome.
},
{
    21.68,26.76
     That's a combination of weak and tight muscles in the upper back chest and shoulder regions.
},
{
    26.76,30.48
     We're going to tackle this by doing dynamic exercises
},
{
    30.48,32.3
     that's going through a lot of motions
},
{
    32.3,34.68
     that are going to target many muscle groups at once
},
{
    34.68,36.6
     in a small amount of time.
},
{
    36.6,38.62
     All of these exercises are going to hit it
},
{
    38.62,39.96
     just a little bit differently.
},
{
    39.96,42.0
     So go through all of them and take the ones
},
{
    42.0,43.68
     that you feel are most effective
},
{
    43.68,45.92
     at fixing your rounded shoulders.
},
{
    45.92,49.6
     All of these exercises are safe, effective, can be done at home, and don't require any
},
{
    49.6,50.76
     special equipment.
},
{
    50.76,52.72
     So with that being said, let's get started.
},
{
    52.72,57.48
     So a big reason why we have forward rounded shoulders is because the muscles that are
},
{
    57.48,60.32
     responsible for bringing them back become weak.
},
{
    60.32,65.52
     So here are two lift off exercises that are going to help with that. The first one
},
{
    65.52,70.8
     Let's go next to a door or a wall. What I'm going to do is just space my body a little bit away from that
},
{
    70.8,76.64
     I'm going to lean into that door of the wall with my elbows bent forearms flush against it for a nice anchor point
},
{
    76.72,79.56
     Let's start off with a chin retraction. Take two fingers
},
{
    79.56,81.8
     Just draw the chin backwards as much as you can
},
{
    81.8,85.5
     You're going to feel the muscles in the neck and upper back start to fire.
},
{
    85.5,92.06
     From there, what I'm going to do is slowly start to raise my arms up at about 45 degrees.
},
{
    92.06,94.72
     If you're using a door, just go towards the corners.
},
{
    94.72,97.14
     Reach up as far as you're able to go.
},
{
    97.14,100.78
     Once you hit that point, from there, what you're going to want to do is keep the elbows
},
{
    100.78,105.04
     locked straight, lift off that door or the wall
},
{
    105.04,107.32
     and bring the elbows back as much as you can.
},
{
    107.32,110.16
     When you do this, you're really going to feel the muscles
},
{
    110.16,113.0
     around the upper back and between the shoulder blades
},
{
    113.0,115.6
     start to fire, even more so into the shoulders,
},
{
    115.6,117.76
     possibly even into the chest.
},
{
    117.76,120.84
     Drive those elbows back as far as you feel comfortable,
},
{
    120.84,123.04
     hold this for 10 to 15 seconds.
},
{
    123.04,129.52
     You're just going to relax, take a breather, and then just simply repeat this three to five times on each
},
{
    129.52,133.68
     repetition. Try to bring the elbows back even further to challenge yourself to
},
{
    133.68,138.44
     help strengthen those muscles. For the second lift off, let's put our back on
},
{
    138.44,143.68
     that door instead. What I'm going to do is put my legs about hip width apart.
},
{
    143.68,147.84
     Let's take our elbows and we're going to place them on the door just like this.
},
{
    147.84,152.82
     My body is going to be flush against the door from the head all the way down to the hips.
},
{
    152.82,154.4
     The movement is very simple.
},
{
    154.4,160.92
     I'm going to drive through my elbows and then lift my body weight forward like this.
},
{
    160.92,165.68
     So I'm lifting my body off the door and driving my weight into
},
{
    165.68,168.8
     my elbows into the door. When you do this you're really going to feel the
},
{
    168.8,173.24
     muscles in between the shoulder blades start to fire. Lift up as much as you
},
{
    173.24,178.24
     can, hold this one for 15 to 20 seconds. You're just going to relax and then
},
{
    178.24,182.14
     you're going to repeat this one three to five times. Again, challenge yourself.
},
{
    182.14,191.24
     Try to drive your body weight forward as much as you can to help engage those muscles. Strengthen them and bring those shoulders back into better
},
{
    191.24,192.24
     alignment.
},
{
    192.24,195.88
     So here's a great exercise for anyone that feels like they've just been seated for too
},
{
    195.88,200.84
     long. Even more so if it's drawing those shoulders forward. Think using cell phones, computers,
},
{
    200.84,206.36
     driving, anything in the modern world today. So I'm going to start in a sturdy chair.
},
{
    206.36,208.58
     Let's have very good upright posture.
},
{
    208.58,211.52
     Let's take two fingers and start with a neck or chin
},
{
    211.52,212.36
     retraction.
},
{
    212.36,214.62
     So what I'm going to do is just drive the head back
},
{
    214.62,218.2
     as much as I can this way until we feel a very good
},
{
    218.2,221.88
     activation of the muscles into the neck and upper back.
},
{
    221.88,224.12
     From there, what I'm going to do is what is known
},
{
    224.12,229.84
     as an imaginary face bowl. Let's take our hands, put them into a fist like this. Our arms
},
{
    229.84,233.58
     are going to be shoulder width apart. I'm going to act like I have a towel or
},
{
    233.58,237.48
     stick in between my hands and then I'm just going to start to bend the elbows
},
{
    237.48,241.84
     and bring that towel back towards my face. When I do this it's going to cause
},
{
    241.84,245.36
     the elbows to wing backward and really start to pinch
},
{
    245.36,248.3
     our shoulder blades and open up the chest.
},
{
    248.3,251.52
     Drive those elbows back as far as you feel comfortable.
},
{
    251.52,253.08
     Really challenge yourself.
},
{
    253.08,257.08
     Once we hit that point, try to hold this one for five to 10 seconds.
},
{
    257.08,260.7
     And then we're going to do a modified wall angle with this.
},
{
    260.7,264.48
     So I'm going to drive the elbows back as far as I can, and then I'm going to rotate my
},
{
    264.48,267.92
     arms to the point where my fingers are up towards the ceiling. And
},
{
    267.92,272.92
     when I do this I try to then bring my elbows back even further. Really try to
},
{
    272.92,276.68
     open up the chest and pinch those shoulder blades in the back. Hold this
},
{
    276.68,281.08
     one for five to ten seconds and then start to raise the arms up straight like
},
{
    281.08,284.8
     this to the point where the hands are overlapping and are going to be able to
},
{
    284.8,285.84
     clap. Hold this one again for five to where the hands are overlapping and are going to be able to clap.
},
{
    285.84,289.88
     Hold this one again for 5 to 10 seconds and then you're just going to slowly come back
},
{
    289.88,292.88
     down and then just relax.
},
{
    292.88,298.84
     You want to do this one for 3 to 5 times and each time you do it try to drive those elbows
},
{
    298.84,304.44
     back even further to challenge yourself because it's only going to help even more with that
},
{
    304.44,306.48
     rounded shoulder posture.
},
{
    306.48,314.48
     This exercise is going to target a tight chest and a weak upper back, two main causes of forward
},
{
    314.48,320.56
     rounded shoulders. This one is best done in bed, but you can also do it on the floor if that is
},
{
    320.56,330.48
     comfortable. Let's go to the edge of a bed to the point where my head is going to be off. What I want to do from there, take two fingers and do a simple neck retraction that is
},
{
    330.48,335.68
     driving the head up towards the ceiling as much as you can. You're going to feel muscles into the
},
{
    335.68,342.64
     neck and upper back start to fire. This helps with rounded shoulders but just overall posture too.
},
{
    342.64,348.32
     What I'm going to do from there, and this is a three-part process, is start off with my palms facing towards the ceiling.
},
{
    348.32,352.32
     The hands are going to be overlapped on the small the back. Our elbows are going
},
{
    352.32,356.88
     to be bent like this. Let's wing the elbows up towards the ceiling as much as
},
{
    356.88,361.64
     we can. When we do this, it should feel like the shoulder blades are pinching in
},
{
    361.64,367.14
     the back. Drive those elbows up as much as you can and activate those muscles.
},
{
    367.14,369.82
     Hold this for 5 to 10 seconds.
},
{
    369.82,374.98
     What I'm going to do from there is straighten my arms at the elbow, point them out 45 degrees
},
{
    374.98,376.9
     backwards just like this.
},
{
    376.9,382.7
     Let's try to raise the elbows up even more and this will activate those muscles further.
},
{
    382.7,383.7
     Challenge yourself.
},
{
    383.7,388.72
     Really try to drive your elbows up during this whole exercise because it will help strengthen those muscles. Again,
},
{
    388.72,393.32
     hold this for five to ten seconds. From there, what I'm going to do is rotate my
},
{
    393.32,396.96
     shoulders and arms. Bring them in front of me to the point where they are now
},
{
    396.96,401.68
     facing 45 degrees in front of me. Thumbs up towards the ceiling. Again, try to
},
{
    401.68,405.32
     raise those elbows up as much as you can. 5 to 10 second
},
{
    405.32,409.32
     hold from here. Last part, I'm just going to take my hands, place them on the back of
},
{
    409.32,414.72
     my head like this, and then wing my elbows up again. 5 to 10 seconds, drive them up towards
},
{
    414.72,419.02
     the ceiling as much as we can. You're really going to feel the chest open up and those
},
{
    419.02,424.08
     shoulder blades starting to pinch activating those muscles. 5 to 10 second hold. From there,
},
{
    424.08,428.06
     we just go in reverse. Put our arms in front of us again at 45 degrees, lifting
},
{
    428.06,433.12
     the elbows up 5 to 10 second hold, and then taking them backwards, doing the same thing
},
{
    433.12,437.18
     until we just complete right where we started.
},
{
    437.18,442.12
     On the next repetition, really just try to drive those elbows up even further.
},
{
    442.12,445.6
     Always challenge yourself because it's only going to help make those muscles
},
{
    445.6,452.24
     stronger and help improve posture and hopefully get rid of those rounded shoulders for good.
},
{
    452.24,458.4
     You want to do this for three to five repetitions. This is going to be a two-part exercise that's
},
{
    458.4,465.96
     going to tackle two big culprits of forward rounded shoulders, That is a tight chest and a weak upper back.
},
{
    465.96,469.36
     Let's first focus on getting rid of the chest tightness
},
{
    469.36,471.72
     with what is known as a chest opener.
},
{
    471.72,472.98
     Pretty fitting, right?
},
{
    472.98,474.28
     You can do this one standing.
},
{
    474.28,476.16
     What I'm going to do is take my arms,
},
{
    476.16,479.44
     place them about 45 degrees out just like this.
},
{
    479.44,482.58
     And then I'm going to take my palms away from me
},
{
    482.58,484.92
     and then take my arms backwards
},
{
    484.92,486.18
     as much as we can, straight
},
{
    486.18,487.18
     at the elbow.
},
{
    487.18,491.6
     When you do this, you're going to feel a very good stretch already happening in the chest.
},
{
    491.6,496.08
     How we're going to take this to the next level, let's take our hands, make fists with them,
},
{
    496.08,500.24
     bend the elbows like this and then place the hands in the small of the back.
},
{
    500.24,504.44
     What I'm going to do from there is then wing my elbows back as much as I can.
},
{
    504.44,509.24
     When you do this, it's going to really start to open up the chest.
},
{
    509.24,511.96
     Go to your comfort level.
},
{
    511.96,514.36
     Hold this for 15 to 20 seconds.
},
{
    514.36,519.8
     From there, you can relax and then just simply repeat this one three to five times.
},
{
    519.8,524.28
     With each repetition, go a little bit further and you should really start to feel it opening
},
{
    524.28,528.38
     up those chest muscles and hopefully get that to relax to bring those shoulders
},
{
    528.38,532.82
     backwards. The next one is going to be kind of a form of a prayer stretch. It's
},
{
    532.82,536.86
     really going to focus on more strengthening the upper back in between
},
{
    536.86,540.82
     the shoulder blades. Again this one is very easy to do. What I'm going to do is
},
{
    540.82,549.44
     start off in a prayer position just like this. I'm then going to raise my arms up like this to the point where I'm reaching overhead as
},
{
    549.44,550.9
     much as I can.
},
{
    550.9,555.44
     From there, I'm going to take my elbows and I'm going to bring them back as much as we
},
{
    555.44,556.44
     can.
},
{
    556.44,561.08
     When you do this, it should really start to activate the muscles into the upper back.
},
{
    561.08,564.92
     Try to challenge yourself by bringing those elbows back as much as you can.
},
{
    564.92,568.64
     Once we hit that point, try to hold this one for about five to ten seconds.
},
{
    568.64,574.46
     And then I'm going to go into the next part which is lowering my elbows down as
},
{
    574.46,580.36
     much as I can. When we do this it should form a W with our body. You'll feel it in
},
{
    580.36,585.92
     the chest but mostly in the upper back. Really focus on firing those muscles.
},
{
    585.92,589.28
     Try to hold this position for about 15 seconds.
},
{
    589.28,592.2
     From there, you just relax, take a breather,
},
{
    592.2,595.92
     and then just simply repeat that three to five times,
},
{
    595.92,598.66
     trying to drive those elbows back even further
},
{
    598.66,600.84
     to help strengthen the upper back,
},
{
    600.84,603.68
     and hopefully lead to less rounded shoulders in the future.
