     Shoulders are one of the most common reasons that people come to see me as an osteopath.
},
{
    5.24,9.64
     The chances are you may even have a shoulder problem, which is why you might be watching
},
{
    9.64,10.64
     this video.
},
{
    10.64,15.52
     In today's video, I'm going to show you what I think shoulder problems develop and what
},
{
    15.52,18.52
     you can do to try and fix your shoulder problems.
},
{
    18.52,28.12
     But before I do that, I need to just briefly explain the anatomy of the shoulder and some of the more significant features of the shoulder
},
{
    28.12,31.12
     and why that's relevant to shoulder pain.
},
{
    31.12,33.28
     Okay, so what we've got here is a model
},
{
    33.28,34.88
     of the shoulder complex.
},
{
    34.88,37.52
     Right now what you're looking at is from the front,
},
{
    37.52,40.36
     almost like you've got my shoulder here
},
{
    40.36,41.56
     and I've taken away everything
},
{
    41.56,43.6
     all you're left with is the shoulder blade.
},
{
    43.6,50.18
     This bony area here is your scapula, also known as your shoulder blade. Here we
},
{
    50.18,54.6
     have the collarbone, which is also known as the clavicle, and then your upper arm
},
{
    54.6,59.08
     bone known as the humerus. All of these muscles that you can see attached are
},
{
    59.08,64.2
     collectively known as the rotator cuff. The rotator cuff is made up of four
},
{
    64.2,65.22
     main muscles. The first one is is made up of four main muscles.
},
{
    65.22,68.3
     The first one is the supraspinatus.
},
{
    68.3,71.1
     Then you've got the infraspinatus,
},
{
    71.1,74.02
     teres, minor and teres major.
},
{
    74.02,75.54
     And then on the front side,
},
{
    75.54,77.94
     you've got the subscapularis.
},
{
    77.94,81.3
     Collectively, the rotator cuff pulls the head of the hubris
},
{
    81.3,84.98
     in towards the scapula, creating stability.
},
{
    84.98,86.44
     Individually, all of the muscles
},
{
    86.44,88.78
     have slightly different functions.
},
{
    88.78,91.44
     Starting with the supraspinatus,
},
{
    91.44,94.88
     it holds the hubris into the socket,
},
{
    94.88,99.54
     tenses the capsule and abducts the arm.
},
{
    99.54,103.64
     The supraspinatus also helps to stabilize the capsule,
},
{
    103.64,105.74
     but this main function is to externally
},
{
    105.74,111.28
     rotate the arm so if you were to bend your elbow and take your hand out to the
},
{
    111.28,116.38
     side that's external rotation. The Terras Minor, the one down here, also
},
{
    116.38,122.54
     weakly helps to externally rotate your arm and lastly the subscapularis helps
},
{
    122.54,126.04
     to medially rotate the arm or internally rotate.
},
{
    126.04,129.28
     So opposite to the infraspinatus,
},
{
    129.28,131.84
     if you were to bend your elbow,
},
{
    131.84,134.4
     you would be taking your hand across your body
},
{
    134.4,135.4
     towards your midline.
},
{
    135.4,137.08
     The reason I mentioned these muscles
},
{
    137.08,140.9
     is because most people I see are extremely tight.
},
{
    140.9,144.8
     This causes a lot of strain to be put on the tendons
},
{
    144.8,146.04
     because people are
},
{
    146.04,151.48
     having to fight against this tightness and one of the main areas that this
},
{
    151.48,158.4
     irritation happens is up here in the supraspinatus. Irritation of the tendon
},
{
    158.4,166.78
     leads to swelling and that swelling causes a reduction in space. So when people then start to
},
{
    166.78,173.62
     abduct their arm that lack of space is causing people a lot more pain.
},
{
    173.62,177.72
     Alright so I've taken away all the muscles and now all you're left with is
},
{
    177.72,188.6
     the joint itself. The joint is known as a ball and socket joint. So here you can see the ball and in here is the socket.
},
{
    189.08,190.88
     What's significant about the shoulder
},
{
    190.88,194.56
     is that the ball and socket is quite shallow.
},
{
    194.56,198.46
     It allows greater range of movement in all directions.
},
{
    198.46,202.54
     But the problem with this increased range of motion
},
{
    202.54,204.76
     means that there's actually a decrease
},
{
    204.76,206.84
     in the amount of stability.
},
{
    206.84,211.68
     So people with hypermobility are often
},
{
    211.68,214.2
     at risk of dislocated shoulders.
},
{
    214.2,217.28
     The other thing that can happen in this region here,
},
{
    217.28,219.5
     more so in older people,
},
{
    219.5,222.92
     is the development of osteoarthritis.
},
{
    222.92,229.36
     And unfortunately, once you get to that stage stage there's not much that can be done from someone like me in the way of treatment
},
{
    229.36,235.44
     and it usually ends up being more of a surgical procedure to try and restore
},
{
    235.44,239.2
     some of the smoothness in that joint. So the next thing I want to just point out
},
{
    239.2,248.0
     to you is this tunnel right here. This is where your supraspinatus muscle runs through.
},
{
    248.0,250.64
     The supraspinatus attaches just above the spine
},
{
    250.64,253.78
     of the scapula and runs through attaching
},
{
    253.78,256.24
     onto the outer part of your humerus.
},
{
    256.24,259.84
     And the reason I mention this is because the supraspinatus
},
{
    259.84,263.36
     is one of the most commonly irritated muscles
},
{
    263.36,264.88
     in the shoulder region.
},
{
    264.88,266.24
     So I've added all
},
{
    266.24,271.2
     the muscles back on. Now as you can see the supraspinatus here is running through this
},
{
    271.2,279.8
     tunnel but when you lift up your arm, if I just take this out, when you lift up your
},
{
    279.8,286.54
     arm that gap becomes a lot smaller and this is the reason why a lot of people get
},
{
    286.54,294.42
     pain in their supraspinatus because an irritation occurs on the tendon and then
},
{
    294.42,300.04
     every time they lift their arm that closing in in size of the the tunnel
},
{
    300.04,304.58
     causes a lot more pressure on the tendon. So let me just put everything I've told
},
{
    304.58,310.0
     you into context for you. Most people who come in to see me have pain in this
},
{
    310.0,315.4
     upper frontal region of the shoulder. To me that usually indicates that there's
},
{
    315.4,321.04
     some kind of tendon ligament or bursar issue and in my experience that's
},
{
    321.04,325.88
     usually because people are extremely tight through the muscles
},
{
    325.88,327.96
     in and around the shoulder.
},
{
    327.96,333.2
     Most commonly that tightness comes from the rotated cuff muscles that I showed you earlier.
},
{
    333.2,339.96
     In order to confirm whether it's tightness causing these issues, I usually do a couple
},
{
    339.96,340.96
     of tests.
},
{
    340.96,345.04
     The first thing I usually get people to do is to show me their ranges of
},
{
    345.04,349.2
     movement. So I'll get them standing in front of me and get them to perform
},
{
    349.2,355.84
     complete abduction all the way up to the ceiling and back down and then following
},
{
    355.84,359.64
     on from that I'll get them to lift the arms up to the front as far as they can
},
{
    359.64,366.0
     and down. And what I usually see in most people is that they're quite limited in
},
{
    366.0,372.6
     full flexion. So when I look at them from the side, their maximum range of movement
},
{
    372.6,380.76
     is to about here. What I would like to see is full range of movement where the
},
{
    380.76,386.52
     arm is right up by the ear. After that I'll get them to do the painful
},
{
    386.52,392.24
     arc test and what you do is you stand arms down by your side and take your arm
},
{
    392.24,399.88
     all the way up to the ceiling and note where they're getting pain. If it's a
},
{
    399.88,407.0
     supraspinatus tendonitis or a bursitis in this sort of upper subacromial region, they
},
{
    407.0,415.52
     will usually feel pain between about 40 degrees to about 120 degrees. Now the reason that
},
{
    415.52,421.86
     happens is because as you get to this sort of area here, the space between the humeral
},
{
    421.86,428.0
     bone and the acromion is completely minimized like I showed you earlier.
},
{
    428.0,435.12
     After that test I will get them to do the scratch test and it looks like this. What you're going to
},
{
    435.12,441.36
     do is take one arm behind you and reach up as far up your back as you can. Once you've done that
},
{
    441.36,446.04
     take the arm down do the same on the other side and then
},
{
    446.04,451.76
     back down and note where both hands or both tips of fingers reach up. Quite
},
{
    451.76,456.2
     often what you see is the side, the shoulder that has the pain will be quite
},
{
    456.2,460.8
     restricted and will not be able to go as far up as the good side. Now on the
},
{
    460.8,468.0
     demonstration I just did what you might be able to see is that my left arm can reach up my back fairly high.
},
{
    468.0,481.0
     But when it comes to the right side, there's a lot less range, which indicates that my right side is tight in either extension or internal rotation,
},
{
    481.0,483.0
     or even just a combination of the two together.
},
{
    483.0,489.24
     This would indicate to me, if it was a patient, that they need to be doing more stretching in those ranges.
},
{
    489.24,494.96
     So if you're having shoulder pain or shoulder discomfort, definitely go
},
{
    494.96,499.56
     through these tests. Have a look at your range of movement first of all. See if you
},
{
    499.56,503.6
     can get those arms all the way up to the ceiling. If you can't you know you're
},
{
    503.6,505.44
     tight. Then take your arms behind you, do that the ceiling. If you can't, you know you're tight. Then take your arms
},
{
    505.44,511.84
     behind you, do that scratch test. If you're struggling to get your arm behind you, then that's
},
{
    511.84,517.6
     an indication that there's definitely tightness in the front or in the rotator cuff muscles.
},
{
    517.6,524.0
     And that will mean that you need to then stretch in a more extension or internal rotation.
},
{
    524.0,525.88
     And since we're on the subject of stretching,
},
{
    525.88,529.4
     I'm gonna show you now some really effective stretches
},
{
    529.4,532.2
     that I prescribe my patients all the time
},
{
    532.2,534.84
     and also how to use some massage balls
},
{
    534.84,536.68
     to get into those tight areas too.
},
{
    536.68,538.56
     The first stretch that you're gonna need to do
},
{
    538.56,540.2
     involves using one of these,
},
{
    540.2,543.08
     which I believe is called a power band or a strength band.
},
{
    543.08,545.28
     You can get these fairly cheap and you get them from Amazon.
},
{
    545.28,547.44
     This is a medium.
},
{
    547.44,550.2
     Anything lighter than that, you're probably not going to get enough stretch.
},
{
    550.2,553.08
     Anything stronger than that and it's probably going to be too strong.
},
{
    553.08,557.68
     So anyway, with the band find somewhere in the gym that you can hook it up or somewhere at home.
},
{
    557.68,561.0
     Once you've got it attached, looped over something above you,
},
{
    561.0,567.0
     put your hand through the band, turn your palm up, face away from the band.
},
{
    567.0,572.72
     Now right now I'm close to the band so there's hardly any stretch going through my arm. Straighten
},
{
    572.72,580.72
     up your arm, lift your chest and gradually step away from where you've attached the band.
},
{
    580.72,584.72
     You should feel this stretch around the front of your shoulder, possibly even going into
},
{
    584.72,586.0
     your bicep.
},
{
    588.0,595.0
     Once you've done that, same setup for the next stretch. Put your hand through. Turn away and lean forward.
},
{
    595.0,599.0
     This allows you to get your arm bent behind your back.
},
{
    599.0,605.4
     With your free hand, hold onto your fingers of the hand as through the loop and then step away and
},
{
    605.4,610.92
     as you step away gradually lift your chest and what you want to try and do is
},
{
    610.92,619.64
     pull this arm this elbow away from your body. Once you finish step back lean
},
{
    619.64,625.8
     forwards and allow yourself to come out of the band. And the last stretch I think you
},
{
    625.8,632.54
     guys should probably do is this one up into full flexion. So get your arm through
},
{
    632.54,637.56
     the band, take it out in front of you and gradually you walk forwards keeping
},
{
    637.56,649.6
     your arms straight until you feel a stretch and just try and push your chest and head through. So here's something
},
{
    649.6,655.06
     else I really like using and that is massage balls. This is a lacrosse ball but
},
{
    655.06,660.0
     a massage ball, lacrosse ball, hockey ball, anything that's hard enough to get
},
{
    660.0,664.88
     into those small muscles will be perfect. I like these because they get into
},
{
    664.88,668.04
     those small muscles that are hard to reach when you're using a foam roller.
},
{
    668.04,674.2
     So what you're going to do is try and get into your rotator cuff. The principle
},
{
    674.2,681.56
     is that you find a tender point, press into it and hold in that position. If you
},
{
    681.56,696.3
     hold long enough that pain will start to disappear. So to get into your rotator cuff, get the ball, place it underneath your arm with your free hand, pull so that you can get this ball further round behind you.
},
{
    696.3,702.7
     Then come up against a wall and press in against the wall.
},
{
    702.7,707.0
     Move around until you can find a tender point.
},
{
    707.0,715.0
     Once you have a tender point, just stay there, relax, and apply some pressure.
},
{
    715.0,722.0
     Maintain that pressure until that pain starts to go away, or you've done about a minute.
},
{
    722.0,725.58
     Once a minute has passed, move to a different
},
{
    725.58,733.82
     point and repeat the process again. Then to get up into these upper muscles, you
},
{
    733.82,740.04
     need to do a bit more contortion. So place the ball up and over, but this time
},
{
    740.04,747.68
     you're going to have to lean back into the wall. Lean up against the wall, again
},
{
    747.68,754.6
     find those tender points, hold and stay for about a minute. So that's pretty much
},
{
    754.6,759.2
     all I'd recommend for now guys. The strength band stretches and the massage
},
{
    759.2,767.04
     balls. I would suggest you do either of those in alternate days. So for example strength band stretches you could
},
{
    767.04,772.4
     do on a Monday, Wednesday and Friday and the massage balls you could do on a Tuesday, Thursday,
},
{
    772.4,778.88
     Saturday. And the reason I say this is because if you do either of them too much you're only going
},
{
    778.88,785.7
     to make yourself quite sore. In terms of how long to do them for, I would suggest doing that each band
},
{
    785.7,791.36
     is stretched for about 15 to 30 seconds, then move on to the next stretch for about the
},
{
    791.36,794.54
     same amount of time, and then the next one for about the same amount of time, and then
},
{
    794.54,800.52
     repeat maybe another one or two times after that if you have time. For the massage balls,
},
{
    800.52,807.22
     find those tender points that I talked about, hold it on there for about 60 seconds and then move on to another point
},
{
    807.52,809.52
     Hopefully you found this video really helpful
