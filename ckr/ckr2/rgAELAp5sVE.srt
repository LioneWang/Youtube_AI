     We are going to take two shallots or small onions and remove the skin.
},
{
    53.56,56.36
     I'm going to crush it in a mortar and pestle.
},
{
    56.36,61.64
     Shallots contain flavonoids which lowers bad cholesterol levels, that is the LDL cholesterol.
},
{
    61.64,71.64
     It protects our cardiovascular system by stopping the cholesterol depositing itself in our arteries. This reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases.
},
{
    71.64,76.4
     Now I am going to add two tablespoons of fresh moringa leaves. You can also use moringa
},
{
    76.4,81.64
     powder. If you are using the powder then mix half tablespoon. Moringa leaves are very
},
{
    81.64,85.28
     effective in reducing the LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
},
{
    85.28,91.4
     And it also prevents the absorption of cholesterol in intestine. Crush it to a fine paste. You
},
{
    91.4,98.72
     can also use a blender to make this paste. Add one teaspoon of lemon juice and one teaspoon
},
{
    98.72,103.64
     of raw honey. Lemon and honey should be in the same quantity. It is also important that
},
{
    103.64,107.24
     you use only raw unpoisturized honey because during the
},
{
    107.24,109.68
     poisturization and filtering process,
},
{
    109.68,112.64
     all the natural enzymes in the honey are destroyed.
},
{
    112.64,115.08
     What we are left with is pure sugar.
},
{
    115.08,117.4
     We need the live enzymes to reduce cholesterol
},
{
    117.4,118.72
     levels in our body.
},
{
    118.72,121.56
     Now the best time to consume this is in the morning.
},
{
    121.56,123.64
     Early in the morning, first thing in the morning,
},
{
    123.64,125.44
     take a glass of warm water
},
{
    125.44,130.32
     and then take two tablespoons of this. You should not drink water after taking this. You have to
},
{
    130.32,136.08
     leave at least 30 minutes before you drink water or eat your breakfast. So what I would suggest is
