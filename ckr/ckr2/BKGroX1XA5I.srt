     Hi, I'm Zach from CoreXL.
},
{
    10.68,15.56
     Today we're going to show you a magic exercise that we use in order to fix multiple injuries
},
{
    15.56,17.88
     in the hips, legs, and lower back.
},
{
    17.88,21.2
     And before we show you the exercise, we're also going to show you the anatomy so you
},
{
    21.2,25.1
     can understand why this exercise is so effective at healing
},
{
    25.1,29.38
     multiple injuries. And now we're going to show you a testimonial from one of our clients.
},
{
    29.38,40.78
     There are judge's down on two and I'm swinging out of Mr. Avenia wipes him out. Talk to me.
},
{
    40.78,45.0
     My back's been off and on bothering me last this past year.
},
{
    45.0,50.0
     You know, sometimes when I was pitching, you know, to flare up,
},
{
    50.0,56.0
     when I'd stand around, especially during BP, you know, you get really tight.
},
{
    61.0,65.72
     So you've been here now for six sessions, and how much better is your back feel?
},
{
    65.72,67.84
     It's night and day difference.
},
{
    67.84,70.44
     My back feels much better than when I got here.
},
{
    70.44,71.88
     No pain now when you're throwing?
},
{
    71.88,72.88
     Yeah, no pain whatsoever.
},
{
    72.88,73.88
     Feel good, feel strong.
},
{
    73.88,87.0
     So we're going to go into the anatomy now and then we're going to show you the exercise.
},
{
    87.0,91.92
     So I've hidden the glute max here on this side, this muscle here.
},
{
    91.92,94.92
     So what we're looking at here is the glute medius.
},
{
    94.92,98.52
     We're going to be working that, but the main thing and concentration is we're going to
},
{
    98.52,102.88
     be working this.
},
{
    102.88,105.16
     And look where this hooks right into the front of the hip.
},
{
    105.16,109.52
     So it's going to it's going to mealy rotate the hips, it's going to internally rotate the
},
{
    109.52,112.44
     hip forward.
},
{
    112.44,120.48
     Okay, if this is weak, what happens is, is this is your main media rotator.
},
{
    120.48,125.16
     So if this is not functioning and strong, the lateral rotators have to start overworking
},
{
    125.16,128.54
     So lateral rotators and they all work as a unit together
},
{
    128.54,133.0
     But this is your main lateral rotator right here your piriformis and it works with these muscles here to
},
{
    133.76,136.06
     Latterly rotate the hip to take it this way
},
{
    138.76,147.28
     And another lateral rotator is your bicep for Morris, okay, and also your sartorius. So when this is weak here,
},
{
    150.08,158.64
     then all three of these start having to overwork. And this is what causes the compensations
},
{
    158.64,165.2
     and starts causing the irritation into the hip flexor, okay, and starts causing the
},
{
    165.2,171.6
     pulls into the bicep for Morris and also the tenonosis here.
},
{
    171.7,174.7
     And the final thing I want you to understand is the IT band,
},
{
    174.7,178.48
     the TFL, okay, this chain here. This is like your bridge muscle
},
{
    178.48,182.04
     for internal rotation and hip flexion. And this also starts
},
{
    182.04,186.64
     getting irritated and taking over all because the glue minimus
},
{
    186.64,191.52
     is weak. The last thing I want you to understand is low back injuries and how the medius and minimus
},
{
    191.52,197.44
     apply to that. Okay look where this hooks right to the top of the crest here the hip okay and look
},
{
    197.44,207.84
     where the erectors and the internal oblique okay and oblique, they all hook up here. So if this is dysfunctional, okay, through here,
},
{
    207.84,211.16
     and if we hide this, also this minimus here, okay,
},
{
    211.16,213.76
     look, that's a huge support structure for the hip.
},
{
    213.76,215.84
     So if this hip becomes unstable here,
},
{
    215.84,220.04
     it's gonna put a lot more stress onto the erectors here.
},
{
    220.04,223.08
     And this is also gonna cause a lot more stress
},
{
    223.08,225.88
     onto your disc and cause herniations
},
{
    225.88,227.78
     and stress out that piriformis,
},
{
    227.78,230.68
     which leads to that sciatic nerve right there overworking.
},
{
    236.62,238.86
     I just want you to bend your knees back and 90 degrees,
},
{
    238.86,240.9
     and then just moving forward just a little bit, okay?
},
{
    240.9,243.5
     So your ankles are gonna be ahead of your knees slightly,
},
{
    243.5,247.92
     but you don't wanna get out into this position here. And you're going to take the same position with
},
{
    247.92,252.86
     your hips as the dangling. So pop your hips forward, arch your back, try to make sure
},
{
    252.86,259.48
     your hips are completely level. So if we're looking at it from here, right here.
},
{
    259.48,263.24
     So now we're going to show you the start point of the exercise. And all you need to do is,
},
{
    263.24,268.8
     this is a soccer ball here, you get a get a soccer ball basketball and you can also deflate in
},
{
    268.8,274.68
     order to make sure that when you set up here you want the knee the top of the
},
{
    274.68,279.36
     knee here at hip level it can also be slightly above around there to start
},
{
    279.36,284.72
     okay and what this is going to do is is we're going to take adduction out of the
},
{
    284.72,286.12
     equation here and we're just going to focus is we're going to take adduction out of the equation here
},
{
    286.12,291.8
     and we're just going to focus on medial rotation here and that allows us to really concentrate
},
{
    291.8,294.64
     on the developing the minimus first.
},
{
    294.64,298.64
     Once you have the strength in the minimus then you're going to have no problem being
},
{
    298.64,303.96
     able to do this and add in then the medius and more adduction because what we're doing
},
{
    303.96,305.78
     is with this exercise we're adducting and then we're med medius and more adduction. Because what we're doing is with this exercise,
},
{
    305.78,308.4
     we're adducting and then we're medially rotating
},
{
    308.4,313.16
     and that adduction really puts the stress onto the medius.
},
{
    313.16,316.18
     And when we do this, that puts more of the stress
},
{
    316.18,318.44
     on the minimus, more internal rotation.
},
{
    318.44,321.28
     So real easy here, put the ball here.
},
{
    321.28,323.32
     Okay, you're not squeezing the ball, just put it there,
},
{
    323.32,325.28
     just let the leg relax on it.
},
{
    325.28,331.68
     Get up on your elbow, pop the hips forward, chest back, form that C shape, arch your back.
},
{
    331.68,337.68
     The toe is pointed down. My big toe here is right in the center. So it's not back here
},
{
    337.68,340.88
     by the ankle, just right in the center of the foot. It's just touching very lightly.
},
{
    340.88,348.44
     So just to be clear with the setup, when you're setting up the ankles are slightly ahead, okay, of the knee here. But when I put
},
{
    348.44,353.08
     this toe with this top foot, when I put this toe here, this top ankle here is in
},
{
    353.08,357.12
     line with the knee and I'm forming a 90 degree knee angle and then you're just
},
{
    357.12,363.48
     going to lift. And only lift as high as you don't feel it into the TFL.
},
{
    370.56,377.28
     feel it into the TFL. So if you feel good, take it all the way up then the ankle to knee level. If it feels more TFL-ish, take it a little bit lower and just develop it where you can feel it
},
{
    378.4,384.0
     back into the butt and not into the TFL. And it's that easy. And look at the toes always
},
{
    384.0,385.58
     pointed down. Don't let
},
{
    385.58,389.88
     your legs get out here too much too. Make sure that ankle is right in line with
},
{
    389.88,394.78
     the knee and then hold it for a two count. Feel that glute work. A mistake that
},
{
    394.78,400.12
     people make when they're doing this is when they come up the roll forward like
},
{
    400.12,406.0
     this with the ball so they'll go, okay? Make sure that your knee,
},
{
    406.0,407.88
     if I had a ruler right here, they'd be level.
},
{
    407.88,411.52
     See how it just stays, right?
},
{
    411.52,412.36
     In line.
},
{
    412.36,415.2
     Also, if you're feeling really tight on this, okay?
},
{
    415.2,416.48
     You could take this bottom leg
},
{
    416.48,419.24
     and just move it forward like a quarter here.
},
{
    419.24,422.96
     And this way, look, I can drop the leg now, okay?
},
{
    422.96,424.92
     A little bit lower here,
},
{
    424.92,429.56
     and now I can keep the range of motion even lower, okay?
},
{
    429.56,431.6
     So that might be a better start point for you
},
{
    431.6,433.12
     and you can play around with that.
},
{
    433.12,435.04
     So before moving on to the advancement,
},
{
    435.04,438.26
     the goal is gonna be to basically keep that toe pointed down,
},
{
    438.26,442.36
     get this at the ankle, to the level of the knee,
},
{
    442.36,444.72
     and be able to use a two pound ankle weight
},
{
    444.72,448.16
     and not feel any compensations in the TFL.
},
{
    448.16,450.64
     And then you know that you're ready for the advancement.
},
{
    450.64,452.4
     If you wanna learn the advancement to the exercise
},
{
    452.4,456.08
     and also how we test this exercise with weight, okay?
},
{
    456.08,458.6
     And you can see this for free of charge.
},
{
    458.6,460.32
     Just go to the details of the video
},
{
    460.32,463.72
     and click on the web app that we have there.
},
{
    463.72,470.2
     And then you're also going to see other sample videos that we have on other exercise to fix your upper body,
},
{
    470.2,475.72
     your lower body, and also your core. And we call this Corex 12. 12 exercises to
},
{
    475.72,480.16
     fix your entire body. And now we're going to compare the toe clam to other PT
},
{
    480.16,483.96
     exercises. And this is the problem with the regular clam here is that it just
},
{
    483.96,489.12
     becomes extremely pure form is dominant because it's involving a lateral
},
{
    489.12,494.04
     rotation at the same time it's involving adduction and there's no
},
{
    494.04,497.8
     medial rotation. And so what happens is you just start training over training
},
{
    497.8,501.64
     the compensations and it doesn't eliminate injuries it actually makes you
},
{
    501.64,505.96
     more prone to injuries in my opinion what I've seen.
},
