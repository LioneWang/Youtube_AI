     In this video, we will be showing you how to give your child erectile enema with a balloon-type catheter.
},
{
    11.0,14.0
     First, let's review what an enema is.
},
{
    14.0,19.0
     Erectile enema is a procedure that means pushing a large or small amount of liquid into the colon,
},
{
    19.0,23.0
     the lower digestive tract, where stool, also called poop, gets pushed out.
},
{
    23.0,25.96
     This liquid could be a combination of saline,
},
{
    25.96,28.48
     which is saltwater, and additives like glycerin
},
{
    28.48,31.6
     or castile soap, or medications like sodium phosphate,
},
{
    31.6,33.56
     fleet, or bisicotal.
},
{
    33.56,36.12
     This mixture helps the body to empty the stool.
},
{
    36.12,37.88
     Some are over the counter and others require
},
{
    37.88,39.92
     the balloon catheter we are going to use.
},
{
    39.92,41.96
     We usually like to start on a combination
},
{
    41.96,44.08
     of saline and glycerin or castile,
},
{
    44.08,48.16
     as this is a simple combination of ingredients that works to soften and remove stool from the
},
{
    48.16,49.16
     colon.
},
{
    49.16,51.42
     To get started, gather your supplies.
},
{
    51.42,55.66
     This will be saline and either glycerin, castile soap, or a combination of both depending
},
{
    55.66,57.68
     on what was ordered for your child.
},
{
    57.68,61.76
     The saline should be room temperature or warmed under warm water like how you would heat up
},
{
    61.76,62.76
     a baby bottle.
},
{
    62.76,64.8
     Now let's prepare the gravity bag.
},
{
    64.8,67.48
     The bag has a roller clamp that controls the flow of the enema and
},
{
    67.48,72.68
     is what makes it start and stop. Roll the clamp down to clamp off the tubing or
},
{
    72.68,76.32
     the prescribed amount of saline into the bag plus a little extra since some will
},
{
    76.32,79.0
     stay in the tubing.
},
{
    82.84,87.72
     Add in glycerin, castile soap, or both as prescribed.
},
{
    87.72,90.22
     Shake or stir it to make sure it's fully mixed.
},
{
    90.22,94.12
     This will keep the tube from getting clogged or blocked.
},
{
    94.12,98.88
     Next, you will release the roller clamp and watch as the solution goes down through the
},
{
    98.88,102.28
     tubing.
},
{
    102.28,107.0
     When it starts coming out at the end, roll the clamp back down to stop the flow.
},
{
    107.0,111.0
     Then, prepare the catheter and a syringe.
},
{
    111.0,113.3
     The catheter has two ports on the end.
},
{
    113.3,117.0
     One is used for the solution and the other is used to inflate the balloon at the end.
},
{
    117.0,120.72
     The balloon helps the catheter stay in the rectum during the enema.
},
{
    120.72,125.16
     Pull back 15-30 mL of air in the syringe and place the syringe on the balloon
},
{
    125.16,126.16
     port.
},
{
    126.16,129.8
     Test the balloon by pushing air into the port and watching the balloon inflate or fill
},
{
    129.8,130.8
     up.
},
{
    130.8,135.76
     If the balloon inflates well, remove the air from the balloon and prepare your child.
},
{
    135.76,139.44
     You may want to have something to distract your child, like a favorite toy, book, or
},
{
    139.44,140.68
     iPad.
},
{
    140.68,144.8
     Have your child lie on their side or on their back with their legs curled up to their chest.
},
{
    144.8,150.48
     Use plenty of water-soluble lubricant on the tip of the catheter and insert it into the rectum.
},
{
    150.48,154.68
     Inflate the balloon with 15-30 ml of air just like you did before.
},
{
    154.68,159.02
     Gently pull the catheter toward your child's anal opening to help block the saline solution
},
{
    159.02,160.6
     from draining out.
},
{
    160.6,164.14
     If the solution leaks out during the enema, you may want to fill the balloon with water
},
{
    164.14,166.78
     instead of air to create a better seal.
},
{
    166.78,170.1
     It is possible that your child may poop out the catheter during the enema.
},
{
    170.1,171.6
     That's okay.
},
{
    171.6,173.94
     Once the catheter is in place, remove the syringe.
},
{
    173.94,176.9
     Hook the tubing up to the other port of the catheter.
},
{
    176.9,179.06
     Slowly release the clamp on the tubing.
},
{
    179.06,182.32
     The enema solution should flow in over about 5 minutes.
},
{
    182.32,185.2
     You can change the rate of the flow by rolling the clamp up or down.
},
{
    185.84,189.68
     Some people like to have the enema tubing connected before they insert the catheter.
},
{
    189.68,194.16
     The enema solution should stay in for five to ten minutes. After five to ten minutes,
},
{
    194.16,202.56
     help your child move to the toilet. Keep the catheter in place while you do this.
},
{
    202.56,208.28
     While your child is on the toilet, deflate the balloon by hooking the syringe up to the balloon port and removing the air or water.
},
{
    208.48,214.08
     Remove the catheter. Your child will begin passing stool and water into the toilet over 30 to 45 minutes.
},
{
    214.32,217.78
     Again, a favorite toy, book, or movie may help pass the time.
},
{
    218.06,222.06
     We usually like to have the enema results completed after one hour of sitting.
},
{
    222.68,228.16
     Sometimes it also helps to have your child get up after they think they are done, move around, then sit back down for five
},
{
    228.16,231.64
     to ten minutes to ensure everything is out. This process may take some practice
},
{
    231.64,235.78
     for you and your child and each kid is different. Find what works best for you
},
{
    235.78,239.56
     both. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to call
},
{
    239.56,None
     your child's provider.
},
