     My name is Kate and I'm an occupational therapist at Hospital for Special Care and I work in the Outpatient Department.
},
{
    7.0,12.0
     And my name is Ruchi, I'm a speech language pathologist in the Outpatient Department here at Hospital for Special Care.
},
{
    12.0,15.0
     Today we're going to be talking about aspiration precautions.
},
{
    15.0,21.0
     Aspiration is actually when food or liquid goes into your airway, which is also called trachea.
},
{
    21.0,23.0
     So is that different from choking?
},
{
    23.0,27.02
     Yes. So when we say choking, we're talking about a complete occlusion of your airway.
},
{
    27.02,28.98
     So that means that you're not getting air
},
{
    28.98,30.14
     in and out of your trachea.
},
{
    30.14,30.98
     So for that,
},
{
    30.98,32.62
     you would actually need the hind leg maneuver
},
{
    32.62,33.46
     versus aspiration,
},
{
    33.46,34.7
     your coughing and stuttering.
},
{
    34.7,36.58
     It might feel really difficult to be breathing
},
{
    36.58,38.62
     because the coughing means that you're getting air flow
},
{
    38.62,40.02
     in and out of your trachea.
},
{
    40.02,41.94
     So one of the things that we talked about all the time
},
{
    41.94,44.78
     is making sure you're using a slow rate when you're eating.
},
{
    44.78,47.3
     As you can see, Kate took a huge bite
},
{
    47.3,49.24
     and it was super hard for her to control
},
{
    49.24,50.52
     what was happening in her mouth.
},
{
    50.52,54.2
     We always talk about aspiration happening in the throat,
},
{
    54.2,56.44
     but a lot of it has to do with what you're able
},
{
    56.44,57.28
     to do in your mouth.
},
{
    57.28,59.6
     If you're having a hard time controlling your chewing
},
{
    59.6,62.04
     and moving that bowl back into your throat,
},
{
    62.04,63.6
     it's gonna be really hard for you
},
{
    63.6,66.4
     and you might actually end up choking or sputtering
},
{
    66.4,68.0
     or having an aspiration event.
},
{
    68.0,69.76
     And a more appropriate thing to do
},
{
    69.76,71.8
     is just to alternate your liquids and solids
},
{
    71.8,72.88
     so that you're slowing down
},
{
    72.88,74.96
     and making sure that you're not taking too many bites
},
{
    74.96,76.4
     in a row when there's still a lot of food
},
{
    76.4,77.8
     left over in your mouth.
},
{
    77.8,79.32
     Something that might be helpful is to take a bite
},
{
    79.32,81.88
     and then put your fork or your spoon down between bites
},
{
    81.88,84.16
     so that you're controlling yourself a little bit better.
},
{
    84.16,86.8
     So this is pretty frequently how people eat at home,
},
{
    86.8,89.04
     especially if they're eating in front of a TV.
},
{
    89.04,91.84
     You'll notice that Kay is feeling very slouchy
},
{
    91.84,93.52
     and very relaxed right now.
},
{
    93.52,94.72
     When she's reclined like this,
},
{
    94.72,97.04
     she has less control of what's happening in her mouth
},
{
    97.04,99.36
     so that things are more likely to move down
},
{
    99.36,101.6
     and back into her throat before she's ready
},
{
    101.6,103.04
     to swallow that bite.
},
{
    103.04,104.64
     Even after she's done swallowing,
},
{
    104.64,106.36
     really she should be sitting nice and upright.
},
{
    106.36,109.0
     When the food is entering her food pipe or her esophagus,
},
{
    109.0,110.6
     you wanna make sure that it's traveling
},
{
    110.6,111.8
     in the direction of her stomach.
},
{
    111.8,113.92
     So you want Bradley to be working in her favor
},
{
    113.92,115.08
     so that the food isn't just sitting
},
{
    115.08,116.44
     in her food pipe for too long.
},
{
    116.44,119.52
     But if it's difficult for you to maintain an upright posture,
},
{
    119.52,120.64
     I would definitely recommend
},
{
    120.64,122.44
     prop your arms up on the table
},
{
    122.44,124.08
     to help hold yourself up a little bit.
},
{
    124.08,128.92
     Or if you can, adjust the height of the surface that you're eating on to help elevate it a little bit
},
{
    128.92,131.42
     so that you can be as upright as possible.
},
{
    131.42,135.64
     It's really important to have strict oral care as part of your regimen and your routine.
},
{
    135.64,140.92
     You really want to reduce the amount of bacteria in your mouth because any of the bacteria that goes down
},
{
    140.92,146.28
     the wrong way into your airway could lead to an aspiration to go in there because it's gonna cause infection.
},
{
    146.28,148.8
     Brushing three times a day is ideal,
},
{
    148.8,150.04
     but at least twice a day.
},
{
    150.04,153.4
     And if it's difficult for you to manage a standard toothbrush,
},
{
    153.4,156.16
     an electric toothbrush has a little bit of a bigger handle,
},
{
    156.16,158.76
     so it can be easier to hold and manipulate.
},
{
    158.76,161.36
     And also it does a lot of the brushing work for you.
},
{
    161.36,163.16
     And if things like glossing are challenging,
},
{
    163.16,164.12
     that's something you can definitely
},
{
    164.12,170.64
     talk to your dentist about. Whether an adapted floster pick or a water pick is
},
{
    170.64,176.48
     something that would be helpful for you. So hopefully this gives you guys some tips to practice at home
},
{
    176.48,183.44
     to help avoid astrusion.
},
