     Hey everybody, it's Doctor Jo and Kali and today we're going to show you the top 10 exercises
},
{
    6.64,11.28
     for the rotator cuff. So let's get started. Disclaimer alert, disclaimer alert.
},
{
    14.24,19.52
     So these top 10 exercises are my favorite top 10. It's not any kind of research base,
},
{
    19.52,25.2
     it's just the ones that I found work best for me and my patients. So the rotator cuff is
},
{
    25.2,31.36
     those four main muscles, SITS. So it's supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor,
},
{
    31.36,37.08
     and sub scapulaeus. However, there's a whole bunch of muscles that attach to
},
{
    37.08,42.2
     the scapula, and it's like 20-ish muscles, so it's a lot. So when you think of
},
{
    42.2,45.32
     strengthening the rotator cuff in general,
},
{
    45.32,52.36
     you really are going to be strengthening all those muscles because you want that shoulder blade, that scapula, to be working correctly.
},
{
    52.36,56.48
     And that helps if you have an injury, it helps fix all those imbalances.
},
{
    56.48,61.26
     So if there's one muscle just messing it up, it can affect that whole shoulder blade.
},
{
    61.26,65.28
     So some of the strengthening exercises might not be specifically
},
{
    65.28,69.84
     for the rotator cuff, but it's really for those muscles that are all around it which really affect
},
{
    69.84,75.36
     it. So we're going to start off with a pendulum exercise. This can sometimes be a stretch or an
},
{
    75.36,81.36
     exercise. I like to add in holding onto a weight which does make it an exercise. So it's really
},
{
    81.36,87.52
     good to start off with the pendulums. It opens up that shoulder joint and it really just starts getting those muscles loosened up and
},
{
    87.52,92.36
     relaxed and warmed up for the other exercises. So let's check that out. For
},
{
    92.36,96.96
     pendulum circles with a weight, lean over on something sturdy like a chair
},
{
    96.96,102.82
     or countertop. Put the weight in the hand that you want to exercise and just let
},
{
    102.82,106.16
     it relax. Move your whole body in a circular motion.
},
{
    119.28,125.78
     For pendulum spread to back with a weight, lean over on something sturdy like a chair counter top.
},
{
    125.78,130.22
     Put the opposite leg forward and the closest one back.
},
{
    130.22,133.98
     Put the weight in the hand you want to exercise and just let it relax.
},
{
    133.98,150.08
     And then shift front to back. For pendulum side to side with a weight, lean over on something sturdy like a chair or
},
{
    150.08,151.08
     a countertop.
},
{
    151.08,155.92
     Put the weight in the hand that you want to exercise and just let it relax.
},
{
    155.92,173.6
     Move your body side to side. So exercise number two is going to be an isometric internal rotation of the shoulder.
},
{
    173.6,175.84
     So this starts getting that rotator cut.
},
{
    175.84,180.38
     These isometric exercises are when you're activating the muscle but you're not actually
},
{
    180.38,181.72
     moving the muscle.
},
{
    181.72,188.88
     And this is important because especially if you've had a surgery or a specific injury where you may be not supposed to be doing the
},
{
    188.88,192.96
     whole movement, then this is a way to start strengthening the muscle without
},
{
    192.96,196.36
     breaking the precautions or maybe you're allowed to do the movement but it's just
},
{
    196.36,200.24
     too painful right now. So the isometrics is a great way to start off doing that.
},
{
    200.24,209.64
     So let's see it for internal rotation. For shoulder internal rotation isometrics, put your elbow by your side at about a 90 degree angle. The motion
},
{
    209.64,213.52
     you're going to be doing is this motion but you're going to take your other hand
},
{
    213.52,217.04
     and push into the hand.
},
{
    233.76,237.96
     Number three. So now it's going to be an isometric external rotation. So same kind of concept without isometric where you're activating the muscle but you're not really moving it.
},
{
    237.96,241.72
     So if you have those precautions or if you have a lot of pain with the movement, this
},
{
    241.72,248.16
     is going to start help strengthening those muscles without really irritating them more. So let's take a look at that. For
},
{
    248.16,253.2
     shoulder external rotation isometrics, put your elbow by your side with your
},
{
    253.2,258.0
     arm bent to about 90 degrees. The motion you're going to be doing is going out
},
{
    258.0,262.56
     this way, but you're going to take your other hand to block it so you're pushing
},
{
    262.56,267.68
     into your hand and then relaxing.
},
{
    274.24,280.84
     Number four, now we're going to move into shoulder internal rotation with a
},
{
    280.84,284.08
     weight. So now you're going to start that movement. Now you're going to have the
},
{
    284.08,285.88
     weight to get those muscles really
},
{
    285.96,291.84
     strengthening throughout the movement versus that isometric where you were just doing it to activate the muscles.
},
{
    291.84,295.76
     So we're going to do this one kind of lying on our side. So let's check it out.
},
{
    296.4,301.96
     For shoulder internal rotation and side lying with a weight, you can use a super vegetable can.
},
{
    301.96,304.92
     The arm you're going to be moving is actually on the ground.
},
{
    304.96,305.6
     you can use a super vegetable can. The arm you're going to be moving is actually on the ground.
},
{
    311.6,313.76
     Put your elbow close to your side and have your elbow at a 90 degree angle and then just bring it up and back down.
},
{
    323.84,329.0
     Number five. So now you're going to do the shoulder external rotation with a weight.
},
{
    329.0,333.0
     So same kind of concept as an internal rotation. You're going to be on your side.
},
{
    333.0,337.0
     You're going to use a weight. It can just be a soup can or vegetable can.
},
{
    337.0,341.0
     It doesn't actually have to be a weight. So let's check that one out.
},
{
    341.0,348.98
     For shoulder external rotation and sideline with a weight weight you can use a super vegetable can. The arm you're going to be working is on top. Put your
},
{
    348.98,354.04
     elbow right next to your side with your elbow bent at 90 degrees. Then with your
},
{
    354.04,360.44
     arm parallel to the ground bring it into your side and come back up.
},
{
    370.68,372.92
     Number six. So this one's going to be a little bit of a series.
},
{
    372.92,379.22
     It's a couple exercises in a row, but I like to just count them as one because it's working
},
{
    379.22,383.8
     kind of the same area, which is that upper thoracic back area, which again has a lot
},
{
    383.8,387.3
     to do with all those muscles attached to the shoulder blade or that scapula.
},
{
    387.3,391.94
     So these are going to be eyes, T's, Y's, and W's.
},
{
    391.94,394.04
     So let's check those out.
},
{
    394.04,397.72
     Here are your eyes, T's, W's, and Y's.
},
{
    397.72,402.04
     For eyes, you're going to lie on your stomach, put your arms straight out in front of you
},
{
    402.04,406.16
     with your thumbs up, and then just lift your arms a little bit off the ground.
},
{
    417.68,427.32
     For tees, you're gonna lie on your stomach, put your arms straight out to the side with your thumbs up and then just lift them a little bit off the ground.
},
{
    437.84,443.88
     For W's, lie on your stomach, bend your elbows into a W position with your palms
},
{
    443.88,445.08
     facing down and
},
{
    445.08,448.36
     then lift your arms up.
},
{
    458.44,463.76
     For Y's you're gonna lie on your stomach, put your arms out at an angle in a Y
},
{
    463.76,469.6
     position with your thumbs up and then lift them up just a little off the ground.
},
{
    479.2,486.64
     Number seven, one of my favorites is the row. So when you do the rowing, you can use a resistive band.
},
{
    486.64,491.2
     And this really helps not only open up the chest and the front, but strengthen those
},
{
    491.2,492.2
     muscles in the back.
},
{
    492.2,497.02
     And it helps get the rotator cuff area, helps get all those muscles around that scapula.
},
{
    497.02,498.64
     So let's check it out.
},
{
    498.64,503.92
     For seated rows with a resistive band, take the band, bending your knees up just a little
},
{
    503.92,505.72
     bit, wrap it around your feet for an anchor, with your knees up just a little bit, wrap it around your
},
{
    505.72,512.4
     feet for an anchor. With your thumbs up and your elbows by your side, pull back and squeeze
},
{
    512.4,531.28
     your shoulder blades. Number eight, bear hugs. Yes, it's exactly how it sounds. You're like going in to give
},
{
    531.28,535.88
     somebody a bear hug. Using a resistive band for this is really great as well. It's kind
},
{
    535.88,540.48
     of the opposite movement of the rows, so now you're strengthening those front muscles while
},
{
    540.48,548.96
     you're stretching out the back muscles. So let's check that out. For bear hugs with a resistive band, take the band and wrap it around behind you.
},
{
    548.96,555.36
     Keep your thumbs upwards and then come out and around just like you're giving
},
{
    555.36,558.12
     someone a bear hug.
},
{
    570.64,576.32
     Number nine, serratus punches. So the serratus anterior muscle is the one that helps keep that shoulder blade close
},
{
    576.32,578.62
     to the rib cage and the spine in the back.
},
{
    578.62,583.84
     So when it's not working properly, that shoulder blade comes out into a winging, we call it
},
{
    583.84,585.04
     a winged scapula.
},
{
    585.04,588.16
     And that's really bad because that can cause a lot of dysfunction and that can
},
{
    588.16,592.6
     cause a lot of pain in the rotator cuff area up in the shoulder. So let's check
},
{
    592.6,598.16
     that one out. For Serratus punches with the resistive band, take the band and wrap
},
{
    598.16,604.28
     it around behind you. Hold the band up on top with your thumbs up and then
},
{
    604.28,605.5
     straighten out your arms.
},
{
    605.5,609.1
     Keep your elbows locked out and punch forward.
},
{
    609.1,613.1
     So not bending those elbows but bringing your shoulders forward.
},
{
    619.9,622.6
     Number 10, bicep curls.
},
{
    622.6,625.32
     Bicep curls, well yes, of course.
},
{
    625.32,629.48
     Again, the bicep muscles aren't a part of the rotator cuff,
},
{
    629.48,633.48
     but that long head of the bicep muscle,
},
{
    633.48,636.6
     the bicep tendon, comes up in underneath
},
{
    636.6,638.52
     that supraspinatus muscle.
},
{
    638.52,640.7
     So it's really important to make sure you strengthen
},
{
    640.7,643.24
     this as well because they sit so close together.
},
{
    643.24,650.56
     If one's irritated, the other one might get irritated as well. So let's check that out. For standing bicep curls with a weight,
},
{
    650.56,658.24
     keep your elbow by your side, turn your palm up, bring it up, and then slowly come back down.
},
{
    668.32,670.76
     So there you have it. Those were your top 10 rotator cuff exercises.
},
{
    670.76,672.28
     Did you like those?
},
{
    672.28,673.28
     Yeah.
},
{
    673.28,677.6
     Remember, those were my favorite, not necessarily any kind of scientific research to it.
