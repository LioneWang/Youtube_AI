     A dermatologist is a doctor who specialises in treating and diagnosing all conditions

     to do with the skin, the hair and the nails.

    14.4,19.36
     And they have more training after qualifying to be a doctor.
},
{
    19.36,24.92
     So they undertake at least two years of training as a junior doctor in the general hospital

     system. take at least two years of training as a junior doctor in the general hospital system and then
},
{
    26.32,33.68
     they go on to do four years of specialty training before becoming a dermatologist. If you do need

    33.68,40.56
     to see a dermatologist your GP or your skin cancer doctor can refer you directly. Skin cancer is a
},
{
    40.56,45.0
     result of damage to the skin cells from UV larch,
},
{
    45.84,49.2
     which is either from the sun or from solariums.
},
{
    49.2,53.56
     We get skin cancer from cumulative UV exposure over time,
},
{
    53.56,56.84
     so it does take some time for skin cancers to develop,
},
{
    56.84,59.4
     but essentially the UV damage is the DNA
},
{
    59.4,61.2
     within our skin cells,
},
{
    61.2,63.84
     and that causes them to become cancerous.
},
{
    63.84,66.64
     Skin cancer is more common with increasing age
},
{
    67.2,73.92
     and you are predisposed to skin cancer if you have fair skin, if there is a family history of
},
{
    73.92,82.64
     skin cancer and other risk factors include red hair or fair hair, blue eyes and freckling.
},
{
    82.64,87.0
     Outdoor workers are particularly risky risk given their lifetime UV exposure.
},
{
    87.0,93.0
     Disgusting nevi is another word for clinically atypical moles or larger moles.
},
{
    93.0,101.0
     They tend to be a little bit larger than your normal moles and they can have some redness to them and they can be raised in places.
},
{
    101.0,105.24
     But they don't have the features of melanoma and they importantly
},
{
    105.24,110.64
     they don't change with time. They are a risk factor of developing melanoma, so if you do
},
{
    110.64,117.12
     have lots of dysplastic moles or atypical moles, you do need to be monitored carefully
},
{
    117.12,122.36
     and photography is really important to monitor these lesions. If you're examining your own
},
{
    122.36,125.26
     skin at home, you should be checking for any
},
{
    125.26,130.5
     lesions that are new or changing. You should be checking all of the surface
},
{
    130.5,135.62
     of your skin and using a mirror to see the areas that are difficult to
},
{
    135.62,140.46
     see such as your back. You can often ask a partner or somebody at home to check
},
{
    140.46,145.68
     your back and return the favor to them. You should be checking your own skin at the turn
},
{
    145.68,150.88
     of each season so that's four times a year and that makes it easier to remember what you saw
},
{
    150.88,156.8
     last time and become more familiar with your skin. Skin cancers develop tippy clean areas that are
},
{
    156.8,162.88
     chronically exposed to the sun so the hidden neck and the arms in Australia are fairly chronically
},
{
    162.88,168.76
     exposed to the sun as well. For melanoma in women it tends to be more common on the legs
},
{
    168.76,171.92
     and for men more common on the back.
},
{
    171.92,176.72
     Some skin enhances can develop on areas of the body that are not exposed to the sun
},
{
    176.72,181.64
     and that includes the soles of the feet and the palms of the hand,
},
{
    181.64,187.04
     the nail and the scalp so it's really important when you go for a skin check
},
{
    187.04,189.68
     to have all of those areas looked at.
},
{
    189.68,193.9
     Certainly it is common to have a melanoma arising
},
{
    193.9,196.7
     as a mole that has darkened,
},
{
    196.7,201.58
     but melanomas can also arise as a completely new lesion
},
{
    201.58,204.18
     and they can be skin colored or pink.
},
{
    204.18,206.08
     So not necessarily brown or
},
{
    206.08,212.32
     darkly coloured. A melanoma should be suspected of any new lesion that is
},
{
    212.32,217.6
     growing over a period of more than a month so melanomas are changing lesions
},
{
    217.6,224.56
     and if there's any suspicion you should see your doctor. Skin cancer is quite
},
{
    224.56,227.8
     treatable in most cases with surgery,
},
{
    227.8,231.16
     but in some cases it certainly can be life threatening
},
{
    231.16,235.4
     and it can require other treatments such as radiation
},
{
    235.4,238.96
     and also systemic therapies.
},
{
    238.96,241.76
     We have a lot of new drugs that can be helpful
},
{
    241.76,244.12
     in treating melanoma, for example,
},
{
    244.12,248.08
     and there's been a lot of press about these which is exciting for patients with more advanced
},
{
    248.08,252.44
     disease. For patients who have had a melanoma it's really important to have
},
{
    252.44,258.72
     ongoing surveillance both for the risk of that melanoma spreading but also the
},
{
    258.72,265.5
     risk of developing a second unrelated melanoma. Skin cancers contribute more deaths than the
},
{
    265.5,271.0
     national road toll and so these deaths are largely preventable with really
},
{
    271.0,275.5
     simple measures. So people should be putting on protective clothing, wearing
},
{
    275.5,280.34
     a hat, seeking shade where it's possible or keeping out of the sun, wearing
},
{
    280.34,285.68
     sunglasses and putting on sunscreen and reapplying sunscreen when it's needed.
},
{
    285.68,287.5
     Sun protection is really important
},
{
    287.5,291.32
     when the UV level is high, typically above three,
},
{
    291.32,295.24
     and you can get information of what the UV level is
},
{
    295.24,298.56
     by using the SunSmart app or other weather apps,
},
{
    298.56,300.92
     including the Bureau of Meteorology.
},
{
    300.92,302.68
     Well, vitamin D is really important
},
{
    302.68,305.48
     for bone health and general health, but we do get enough vitamin D is really important for bone health and general health but we do
},
{
    305.48,311.16
     get enough vitamin D through the day just with general exposure as we're doing
},
{
    311.16,316.32
     the shopping or going to the car. We really only need 10 minutes or so a day
},
{
    316.32,321.68
     over summer and you will certainly get enough vitamin D even if you're wearing
},
{
    321.68,328.0
     sunscreen. There are some exceptions, older patients and people with darker skin types will need
},
{
    328.96,332.88
     more UV exposure to get the adequate amount of vitamin D.
},
{
    332.88,336.04
     And so supplementation is often a good measure
},
{
    336.04,337.12
     for these people.
},
{
    337.12,339.92
     Your vitamin D level will fluctuate through the years
},
{
    339.92,342.16
     that will be lower over the winter months
},
{
    342.16,344.52
     and it will naturally increase over summer.
},
{
    344.52,350.04
     So it's not necessary to use sunscreen and sun protection over winter months
},
{
    350.04,354.0
     unless you're going to the snow or somewhere where it's glaring.
},
{
    354.0,359.36
     You really only need small bursts of sun exposure to get adequate vitamin D.
},
{
    359.36,361.84
     And this sun exposure is best in the morning.
},
{
    361.84,370.24
     You really should avoid prolonged exposure through the day and when the UV level is high. Any sunscreen that is broad
},
{
    370.24,377.84
     spectrum that is it covers UVA and UVB and is also a factor 30 plus or above is
},
{
    377.84,383.1
     perfectly adequate so long as it is applied properly and it is reapplied
},
{
    383.1,386.88
     after being in the sun for more than two hours.
},
{
    386.88,None
     It should also be within its inside date. you
