},
{
    15.8,16.64

{
    16.64,17.56
     In our opinion, of course, Bob.
},
{
    17.56,19.0
     We need affirmation, Brad.
},
{
    19.0,20.72
     Affirmation, exactly.
},
{
    20.72,23.16
     Today we're gonna talk about swollen ankle sprain,
},
{
    23.16,26.56
     how to stop pain, swelling, and three steps.
},
{
    26.56,29.12
     Common thing, ankle sprains are very common.
},
{
    29.12,29.96
     Right.
},
{
    29.96,31.96
     So we're gonna tell you the first things
},
{
    31.96,33.8
     you're gonna do when it first happens.
},
{
    33.8,35.56
     Right, we've covered this before,
},
{
    35.56,37.92
     but we don't have a video specifically for this
},
{
    37.92,40.72
     or with a title that specifically draws people
},
{
    40.72,41.56
     to a pool.
},
{
    41.56,42.4
     We're swelling especially.

     The giveaway, Brad, is a sleep-ovation mattress.
},
{
    72.52,74.76
     And also they're giving away some pillows.
},
{
    74.76,76.32
     So they're sleep-ovation pillows.
},
{
    76.32,78.48
     This pillow actually has springs in it,
},
{
    78.48,79.84
     but you don't feel them.
},
{
    79.84,80.96
     It's kind of a miracle.
},
{
    80.96,83.0
     Yeah, they really do an amazing job
},
{
    83.0,84.64
     of how the manufacturer works.
},
{
    84.64,88.56
     Yeah, no down, no, none of that foam, that warm foam.
},
{
    88.56,90.2
     Right, yep, exactly.
},
{
    90.2,91.52
     All right, let's go to work, Brad.
},
{
    91.52,95.24
     Okay, so the reason that really I got this video going,
},
{
    95.24,99.0
     cause a friend of mine actually lives out in California.
},
{
    99.0,102.36
     I get a picture and he's got this ankle slowing up.
},
{
    102.36,103.84
     He's not an athlete or, you know,
},
{
    103.84,104.96
     does these kind of things he did.
},
{
    104.96,106.92
     I guess walking over a curb or something.
},
{
    106.92,109.58
     Just one of those everyday incidences.
},
{
    110.56,112.04
     And he shows me a picture of this ankle.
},
{
    112.04,112.88
     It's all swollen up.
},
{
    112.88,114.68
     Looks like a small football.
},
{
    114.68,116.6
     And the other side, look at right to left.
},
{
    116.6,118.36
     You know, it's like, maybe swollen.
},
{
    118.36,121.08
     So I'm texting information.
},
{
    121.08,124.32
     It's like, I just got to get a video for this young man
},
{
    124.32,126.2
     so that everything is clear.
},
{
    126.2,128.0
     So this is how it works.
},
{
    128.0,131.0
     If you got this swollen ankle, it's painful.
},
{
    131.0,132.0
     First thing you need to know,
},
{
    132.0,134.12
     if there's any question of it's fractured,
},
{
    134.12,135.46
     you should see a doctor.
},
{
    135.46,136.92
     We actually did a video on this, Brad,
},
{
    136.92,137.84
     I'll have to recall.
},
{
    137.84,140.92
     We did a video on how to tell whether or not
},
{
    140.92,142.4
     there may be a fractured ankle.
},
{
    142.4,145.92
     And there's just, again, type in Bob and Brad
},
{
    145.92,150.92
     under our search and put ankle, sprain,
},
{
    151.28,155.28
     or is it a fracture or see your doctor, something like that.
},
{
    155.28,156.44
     You just came up with this now.
},
{
    156.44,158.24
     Well, you didn't tell me that you were gonna do this,
},
{
    158.24,159.28
     so I didn't know.
},
{
    159.28,161.84
     Either way, if there's any question,
},
{
    161.84,163.84
     see a doctor, get an X-ray and confirm it.
},
{
    163.84,165.56
     Well, one of the things is, I remember, is if you can't weight bear on it, if there's any questions, see a doctor, get an X-ray and confirm it. Well, one of the things is, I remember,
},
{
    165.56,167.2
     is if you can't weight bear on it,
},
{
    167.2,170.16
     if it starts to hurt, then you probably should go in.
},
{
    170.16,172.16
     You really should, absolutely.
},
{
    172.16,174.08
     Regardless, in regards to the swelling,
},
{
    174.08,176.96
     you gotta get the swelling under control.
},
{
    176.96,180.8
     So immediately, you need to get a cold pack.
},
{
    180.8,182.48
     You need to get a cold pack that,
},
{
    182.48,185.2
     it works best, the one that you can wrap around. You can buy them, like this one is from iReliev, they make a a cold pack that, it works best the one that you can wrap around.
},
{
    185.2,187.88
     You can buy them like this one is from iReliev.
},
{
    187.88,189.6
     They make a nice cold pack.
},
{
    189.6,191.84
     You can make them, they work really well too.
},
{
    191.84,194.72
     Bob and Brad, how to make your own cold pack.
},
{
    194.72,196.76
     We show you how to make that with little water,
},
{
    196.76,198.16
     rubbing alcohol and-
},
{
    198.16,200.56
     Yeah, this is gonna be the case no matter if you have
},
{
    200.56,202.4
     a sprain or a fracture, whatever,
},
{
    202.4,204.36
     you gotta get the swelling under control.
},
{
    204.36,208.46
     So- Because the swelling, you know you know, it does help it heal,
},
{
    208.46,210.16
     but it goes out of control.
},
{
    210.16,212.72
     So we gotta get it back in under control.
},
{
    212.72,214.4
     And this is out of control.
},
{
    214.4,215.24
     Yeah, it is.
},
{
    215.24,217.08
     It was Silas, that's his name.
},
{
    217.08,218.92
     So here, why don't you move Bob?
},
{
    218.92,219.76
     Oh, sure.
},
{
    219.76,222.64
     So when you cold pack, you wanna elevate
},
{
    222.64,224.52
     the body part higher than the heart.
},
{
    224.52,226.94
     So the best way to do that, probably with this,
},
{
    226.94,230.78
     is lay down, get some pillows out,
},
{
    230.78,232.98
     and put the cold pack around.
},
{
    232.98,234.22
     And it's gonna feel good to do this.
},
{
    234.22,235.98
     Yeah, it typically feels good.
},
{
    235.98,239.3
     15 minutes, I just was looking at the research on that.
},
{
    239.3,242.54
     And they're saying 15 minutes is all you need
},
{
    242.54,243.74
     for a cold pack.
},
{
    243.74,247.32
     And then take it off, and then in a couple more hours,
},
{
    247.32,249.8
     if you can afford it around your work schedule,
},
{
    249.8,253.56
     put it on again and do that throughout the day.
},
{
    253.56,256.0
     If you're busy and you cannot do that,
},
{
    256.0,259.6
     you should wrap the ankle so that there's some compression
},
{
    259.6,263.04
     on it so that the swelling, it doesn't continue to blow.
},
{
    263.04,266.32
     Cause usually when you put this on and elevate it,
},
{
    266.32,268.66
     you take it off and say, wow, it looks a lot better.
},
{
    268.66,270.62
     We want to maintain that by wrapping it.
},
{
    270.62,273.38
     Bob's going to show how to wrap an ankle.
},
{
    273.38,274.42
     You need some A-strap.
},
{
    274.42,276.22
     You can get at the,
},
{
    276.22,278.86
     Oh yeah, it's a hardware store on a hardware store.
},
{
    278.86,279.7
     Drug store.
},
{
    279.7,280.54
     Yeah, there you go.
},
{
    280.54,282.1
     I'm not letting go.
},
{
    282.1,283.66
     Yeah. There we go.
},
{
    283.66,285.4
     We have six inch wrap here.
},
{
    285.4,286.64
     Yeah, this is too big.
},
{
    286.64,290.0
     Yeah, you should get the three or the four inch wide.
},
{
    290.0,292.64
     But Bob will be able to show you the concept.
},
{
    292.64,294.56
     If I keep it on, don't worry about it Bob.
},
{
    294.56,295.84
     Wow.
},
{
    295.84,297.52
     Why is this grabbing, there we go.
},
{
    297.52,298.36
     Okay.
},
{
    298.36,299.6
     Deal with the steel clips.
},
{
    299.6,302.64
     All right, what I wanna do is because we're trying to help
},
{
    302.64,304.92
     push the swelling back up into the body,
},
{
    304.92,308.94
     I am gonna start one layer basically right here.
},
{
    308.94,309.9
     Around the forefoot.
},
{
    309.9,313.42
     Around the forefoot, yep, because again,
},
{
    313.42,315.78
     the fluid has to go pushed up into the body
},
{
    315.78,319.3
     where the process, and then you can pee it out.
},
{
    319.3,321.94
     You're normally gonna use a lot smaller wrap than this.
},
{
    321.94,323.22
     This is, what is this Brad?
},
{
    323.22,324.3
     I think that's six inch.
},
{
    324.3,325.2
     Probably six inch.
},
{
    325.2,326.04
     Wide.
},
{
    326.04,327.08
     Probably half of this.
},
{
    327.08,328.3
     If you want a thinner wrap,
},
{
    328.3,330.56
     because it's gonna be a lot easier to go around your ankle.
},
{
    330.56,332.64
     Three inch or four inch will probably be adequate.
},
{
    332.64,334.88
     So we got some clips that hold onto this
},
{
    334.88,337.88
     to help hold it together once we put it on.
},
{
    337.88,339.48
     Start with the wrap.
},
{
    339.48,340.68
     So you got the roll here,
},
{
    340.68,341.8
     you got the flat part here.
},
{
    341.8,343.58
     I'm gonna go on top of the foot.
},
{
    343.58,345.68
     What we're trying to do is we're trying to push the fluid
},
{
    345.68,347.16
     up into the body.
},
{
    347.16,350.08
     So we're gonna start on the most distal part,
},
{
    350.08,352.8
     the most farther part away from the body.
},
{
    352.8,354.24
     And I'm gonna wrap around like this,
},
{
    354.24,355.68
     I'm gonna go around twice.
},
{
    357.5,358.96
     Leave the toes exposed.
},
{
    358.96,360.48
     Yep, leave the toes exposed.
},
{
    360.48,364.4
     And now this is where I go up and around
},
{
    364.4,366.08
     and do a figure eight, but this is where I go up and around and do a figure eight,
},
{
    366.08,367.88
     but this is where the magic happens a little bit
},
{
    367.88,370.74
     because people tend to sprain their ankle this way.
},
{
    370.74,373.4
     So right now I can give a little tug
},
{
    373.4,376.1
     which pushes the foot out that way.
},
{
    376.1,379.16
     So that it's actually putting the foot in the right spot
},
{
    379.16,382.96
     and it's pushing the fluid out of there at the same time.
},
{
    384.56,385.72
     So now I can go ahead and wrap.
},
{
    385.72,388.36
     Again, this wrap is too big for him
},
{
    388.36,390.6
     so it's gonna leave a lot of kind of ears.
},
{
    390.6,392.72
     Little, yeah.
},
{
    392.72,393.92
     But one thing you wanna think about it
},
{
    393.92,396.04
     is what really critical is when you wrap it,
},
{
    396.04,398.36
     it's a little bit tighter around the forefoot
},
{
    398.36,400.12
     as you come up the leg.
},
{
    400.12,400.96
     You go looser.
},
{
    400.96,402.2
     You don't pull so tight.
},
{
    402.2,403.04
     Exactly.
},
{
    403.04,404.32
     You can create a tourniquet issue
},
{
    404.32,406.52
     and then cause the legs to actually get worse.
},
{
    406.52,409.04
     Yeah, the worst thing you would do is to have it loose here
},
{
    409.04,412.48
     and tight here and it'll push the fluid back into the foot.
},
{
    412.48,413.32
     Right.
},
{
    413.32,416.02
     So you want it tight here, looser here,
},
{
    416.02,417.62
     and then when this is in place,
},
{
    417.62,419.56
     you can use the clips to help hold it in place.
},
{
    419.56,422.32
     If you don't have clips, use some tape.
},
{
    422.32,423.24
     That works too.
},
{
    424.28,426.62
     And when Bob says tight down here,
},
{
    426.62,430.96
     don't put it on it real tight, it's just snug at the most.
},
{
    430.96,433.4
     Yeah, if you're starting to get tingling or,
},
{
    433.4,435.08
     yeah, you know, it feels-
},
{
    435.08,437.36
     If your toes are turning red, you've got it way too tight.
},
{
    437.36,439.76
     You're turning blue, one of the two.
},
{
    439.76,441.0
     It's way too tight.
},
{
    441.0,443.4
     Okay, so then you can wear that throughout the day.
},
{
    443.4,447.92
     Now, if you have this on, and when you put weight on it,
},
{
    447.92,449.5
     it's uncomfortable and painful.
},
{
    449.5,453.0
     You need to use something like a crutch, a cane,
},
{
    453.0,454.0
     or a walker.
},
{
    454.0,456.16
     Sure, we've got them all over here.
},
{
    456.16,458.12
     It depends on your level of capability.
},
{
    458.12,459.32
     Now, in Silas's case,
},
{
    459.32,461.92
     he would probably do well with a crutch.
},
{
    461.92,462.92
     Cane might be helpful,
},
{
    462.92,465.96
     but a lot of people in their 20s and 30s don't wanna be seen.
},
{
    465.96,467.04
     Don't wanna run around with a cane.
},
{
    467.04,468.76
     But a crutch is pretty cool.
},
{
    468.76,470.96
     So, you know, make sure actually you're gonna use it.
},
{
    470.96,473.4
     You can use two of them, and then you swing through.
},
{
    473.4,476.8
     If you just want one, if it does tolerate some
},
{
    476.8,479.8
     and you wanna just unweight it partially,
},
{
    479.8,482.8
     use the crutch opposite the ankle sprain.
},
{
    482.8,485.12
     So a right ankle, left arm,
},
{
    485.12,487.44
     and then you're gonna walk like this
},
{
    487.44,490.24
     so that you take the weight through the crutch
},
{
    490.24,493.0
     and the injured foot at the same time.
},
{
    493.0,495.6
     And you'll be amazed at how much that helps.
},
{
    495.6,497.08
     Not like this.
},
{
    497.08,499.44
     This is not gonna work so well.
},
{
    499.44,501.2
     People think it will, but it doesn't.
},
{
    501.2,503.92
     You have to trust me and just try that out.
},
{
    503.92,509.56
     Or if it's not too bad, you just need to unweight it a little bit a cane or good again opposite the foot
},
{
    510.32,513.08
     depending on your age and your capabilities
},
{
    513.76,518.8
     Usually this is more for you know an older person is and they're going to use a walker and
},
{
    520.4,524.4
     It's really easy to keep the weight off of it if you use a walker for one thing
},
{
    524.4,526.78
     I mean because you can really lean on a walker.
},
{
    526.78,528.58
     Right, they're stable.
},
{
    528.58,531.82
     So, you know, you can keep the foot up even.
},
{
    531.82,533.34
     Right, if you're completely not,
},
{
    533.34,534.54
     if it's that sore, you can-
},
{
    534.54,536.06
     If it's that sore, right?
},
{
    536.06,537.98
     You're non-weight bearing, basically.
},
{
    537.98,540.3
     So, make sure you be nice to it.
},
{
    540.3,541.26
     Don't walk on it.
},
{
    541.26,543.94
     If it's creating pain, particularly sharp pain,
},
{
    543.94,546.26
     it's just gonna stay swollen
},
{
    546.26,549.36
     and it's gonna go one step forward and two steps back,
},
{
    549.36,550.2
     no pun intended.
},
{
    550.2,553.44
     Yeah, one of the signs that it might be fractured too
},
{
    553.44,557.28
     is if you actually get a lot of bruising or blood
},
{
    557.28,558.76
     in the area.
},
{
    558.76,560.92
     Sure, yeah, exactly.
},
{
    560.92,563.8
     And a lot of times if you heard like a crack,
},
{
    564.76,567.96
     that's a sign too, but do watch our other video.
},
{
    567.96,569.8
     It does, it actually works out pretty good.
},
{
    569.8,572.8
     I just used it on a neighbor not too long ago
},
{
    572.8,574.52
     and it goes over all the guidelines
},
{
    574.52,576.36
     of where to push and tell.
},
{
    576.36,577.2
     Oh, oh.
},
{
    577.2,578.8
     And it's pretty darn accurate.
},
{
    578.8,579.64
     Right.
},
{
    579.64,581.88
     It was in his case, we nailed it.
},
{
    581.88,584.12
     So, oh, you're gonna show a brace too.
},
{
    584.12,588.0
     Yeah, the next step is when it's not quite so swollen,
},
{
    588.0,589.16
     but it's really nice.
},
{
    589.16,591.46
     This type of brace really works well.
},
{
    591.46,593.92
     They're air bladder on each side,
},
{
    593.92,598.0
     and you just put it on like this,
},
{
    598.0,599.4
     and they're all Velcro.
},
{
    600.6,601.52
     Works quite well.
},
{
    601.52,603.88
     Yeah, it does a really good job of stabilizing it.
},
{
    603.88,604.72
     Yeah.
},
{
    604.72,607.9
     And these are, they fit a lot of sizes
},
{
    607.9,610.14
     because they have a lot of latitude there.
},
{
    610.14,610.98
     Right.
},
{
    610.98,611.82
     You know, so.
},
{
    611.82,613.92
     And you can actually, on some of these,
},
{
    613.92,616.64
     you can actually fill up the bladder with more air.
},
{
    616.64,617.48
     Right.
},
{
    617.48,618.68
     So it conforms to your ankle.
},
{
    618.68,619.52
     Right.
},
{
    619.52,622.36
     You're not gonna wear this if it hurts to walk on it.
},
{
    622.36,623.64
     You're still gonna be wrapped.
},
{
    623.64,625.44
     But when you can start to put weight on it
},
{
    625.44,627.72
     and you still want some support, these are ideal.
},
{
    627.72,630.12
     I think they're one of my favorite ones.
},
{
    630.12,633.2
     And I have patients that are typically real happy with them.
},
{
    633.2,635.08
     Yeah, this isn't something I'd wear
},
{
    635.08,636.76
     when going back to sports.
},
{
    636.76,640.0
     No, no, this is just still,
},
{
    640.0,641.72
     there's still swelling.
},
{
    641.72,643.48
     Walking is just tolerated,
},
{
    643.48,645.54
     but up and down stairs you're not running
},
{
    645.54,648.4
     or anything like that because that's too high a level.
},
{
    648.4,651.16
     It'll stop your ankle from turning, that's for sure,
},
{
    651.16,652.3
     and causing more problems.
},
{
    652.3,654.18
     It really makes people feel comfortable.
},
{
    654.18,656.66
     They feel protected, it does the compression,
},
{
    656.66,657.98
     it really supports well.
},
{
    657.98,660.34
     And then the other thing you're gonna do
},
{
    660.34,663.74
     is three times a day take your ankle brace off
},
{
    663.74,667.32
     or the wrap off, and you're gonna do the ABCs.
},
{
    667.32,671.64
     We wanna keep that ankle from becoming stiff,
},
{
    671.64,675.12
     as well as motions gonna help pump some fluid up as well.
},
{
    675.12,677.56
     So I always tell my patients, pretend your big toe
},
{
    677.56,682.2
     is a piece of chalk and there's a chalkboard in front of you
},
{
    682.2,685.06
     and you're gonna make the A letter A, always capitals.
},
{
    685.06,685.9
     Capital letters.
},
{
    685.9,688.56
     So make a, and you're using your imagination.
},
{
    688.56,692.4
     You don't tape a piece of chalk to your toes, literally.
},
{
    692.4,696.46
     So you make that A and cross it and then make the B
},
{
    696.46,698.56
     and you make as big as you can.
},
{
    698.56,700.28
     If you've got a lot of sharp pain with this
},
{
    700.28,702.52
     it's too early, but usually this is tolerated well,
},
{
    702.52,704.48
     just don't move it as much.
},
{
    704.48,709.0
     So the motion is gonna help the stiffness, the swelling.
},
{
    709.0,712.56
     And if you maybe only get up to D or E the first day
},
{
    712.56,714.76
     because it's tired, it's starting to hurt.
},
{
    714.76,717.32
     But then you can come back later on a few hours.
},
{
    717.32,718.92
     Give it a break, go right back to it
},
{
    718.92,720.72
     and see what it can tolerate.
},
{
    720.72,722.08
     But it's good for, like you said,
},
{
    722.08,723.4
     knock the fluid out of there too,
},
{
    723.4,724.64
     help pump it out of there.
},
{
    724.64,725.8
     And then you can see, you know,
},
{
    725.8,727.24
     if you're at the E and the next day
},
{
    727.24,728.52
     you can get up to the letter M,
},
{
    728.52,732.16
     it's pretty easy way to keep track of your progress.
},
{
    732.16,734.64
     So, and once you get past that point,
},
{
    734.64,736.26
     you need more aggressive exercises.
},
{
    736.26,738.4
     We do have a number of videos for
},
{
    738.4,741.4
     how to get yourself going so you can get back to stairs.
},
{
    741.4,742.32
     How to rehab.
},
{
    742.32,744.6
     Yeah, get back into the sport,
},
{
    744.6,747.12
     if you're into sports or just walking your daily life
},
{
    747.12,750.44
     and walking around to get to work, et cetera.
},
{
    750.44,751.48
     Good luck, Silas.
},
{
    751.48,752.32
     Silas, is that a good one?
},
{
    752.32,754.24
     Silas, yes, he's a fine young man.
},
{
    754.24,None
     All right, Silas, good luck to you. you
},
