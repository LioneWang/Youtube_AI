},
{
    14.32,19.48
     In our opinion, of course Bob, today we're gonna go over how to fix a stiff neck in seconds and this works
},
{
    19.84,22.52
     Well, yes, unlike some of the other stuff we talk about
},
{
    23.08,26.34

     Bob and Brad and you do that and we will send some positive vibes your way
},
{
    42.86,43.98
     There you go
},
{
    43.98,49.6
     Probably shaking your computer your phone right now right out of your hand. Hold on to it
},
{
    49.6,55.32
     Yeah, all right now we're talking about today. We're not talking about if you have what we call
},
{
    55.76,57.32
     Ridiculopathy or
},
{
    57.32,62.76
     You know pain from a pinched nerve of the neck. It goes down the arm sometimes into the fingers
},
{
    63.48,67.08
     So that's a go back too, you know way back here
},
{
    67.52,71.14
     That that generally some of these exercises might help that
},
{
    71.6,74.74
     But there's really a different approach that we prefer that you do it
},
{
    74.74,79.66
     We'd rather have you watch some of our other videos on it. This is the run of the mill stiff neck
},
{
    80.2,86.68
     Pain in the neck might be from arthritis quite often is and what we have found is that
},
{
    86.68,91.36
     What not we have found but people have discovered is that by regaining motion
},
{
    91.76,94.76
     By regaining motion your pain levels go down, right
},
{
    95.52,100.44
     So you first need to determine which way is your neck stiff, right?
},
{
    100.44,104.68
     And this is not always easy to do you might need someone to go ahead and look at your
},
{
    105.2,107.2
     Your beautiful mug there
},
{
    107.72,112.68
     Yeah, so even a therapist it's like I just had one of our therapists
},
{
    112.68,115.8
     You said could you look at my wrist because it's really hard to assess myself
},
{
    115.8,119.0
     It is, so when you got another eye just look at it on your ear
},
{
    119.0,122.96
     If you're looking in the mirror that'll help, it helps but a lot of times
},
{
    123.88,125.82
     You know I've seen people, even
},
{
    125.82,129.68
     sometimes I'll feel stiff like going one direction and they'll go yeah but it
},
{
    129.68,133.68
     has pretty good motion even though so but anyway let's start off with the
},
{
    133.68,139.08
     first one. The first movement which is usually not lacking in people is going
},
{
    139.08,143.68
     chin down to chest here and the reason it's not lacking is because unfortunately
},
{
    143.68,145.32
     we spend too much of our days looking down
},
{
    145.32,150.12
     Looking down at papers, looking down at books, your phone
},
{
    150.12,155.28
     Yeah, so it usually you're not stiff in that direction. We won't even address that direction
},
{
    155.28,156.32
     Sure
},
{
    156.32,159.28
     Let's go the opposite way going back like this
},
{
    159.72,165.36
     That one quite often is stiff, I'd say in the majority of people there's some stiffness
},
{
    165.36,170.8
     Sure, and show Brad what a you know here you are 50 some years old, but look how far back Brad can go
},
{
    170.8,172.8
     And this would be normal if you could
},
{
    172.96,176.48
     Yeah, you should really be able to go back
},
{
    176.48,182.8
     I don't care if you're in your 70s or 80s and you're only gonna go this far, we can improve on it
},
{
    182.8,189.36
     You can go further, right, You may not get that far back, but you know if it's stiff a little bit just a little bit of
},
{
    190.44,195.68
     Improvement with range can decrease your symptoms. The other thing I see Brad by the way often is they do this
},
{
    196.04,200.6
     They drift one direction, now that's probably beyond the scope of this video
},
{
    200.6,206.5
     But I always try to make sure you're gonna when you're working on this try to go directly back don't go
},
{
    206.78,213.5
     Drift one way or the other. All right the other one direction that's quite often a little bit easier to see is rotation
},
{
    213.5,218.74
     Sure, so if you're again you're gonna sit up nice and straight a lot of times maybe even in a chair
},
{
    219.74,222.38
     And you're gonna go ahead and rotate to the right
},
{
    224.3,227.6
     And then you can go ahead and rotate to the left now with me
},
{
    227.6,232.16
     I feel like I'm a little stiffer going to the left with Brad
},
{
    235.88,241.28
     Oh now he's faking it. I have it's pretty equal. Yeah, he's pretty equal on this one
},
{
    241.28,245.44
     So but it's pretty common to see. yeah, it's not uncommon to see one direction
},
{
    246.2,251.36
     Limited, sometimes both directions limited, sometimes means a lot of things going on.
},
{
    251.36,253.36
     Sure, all right
},
{
    253.36,259.2
     Now the next one is going and actually gonna again have good posture and you're gonna actually bend to the side
},
{
    259.48,271.44
     Now if you look at me, and if you're fairly observant you're gonna see that I am stiff going to the right I go a lot further to the left and I go to the right. Am I correct Brad? You are correct. He's correct. You concur
},
{
    272.0,276.5
     So that that is the direction quite often when I do start getting pain
},
{
    276.56,280.28
     That's what direction I work on and it definitely takes away my pain
},
{
    280.76,285.48
     So I'm not lying. You should do it some more maybe you could regain that permanently.
},
{
    285.48,289.72
     I know but it's you know the reason I have it Brad is because when I do notes
},
{
    289.72,293.04
     I like this without even thinking about it.
},
{
    293.04,296.48
     And I'm doing notes all the time and paperwork all the time so
},
{
    296.92,301.88
     You know that's the problem. You always talked about that scene in Forest Gump.
},
{
    301.88,305.96
     Oh, right. Yeah, if you ever watch forest gump at the end of the movie
},
{
    305.96,311.56
     He's sitting with his child and son and they both sit and look at the TV and they both tilt their heads the same way
},
{
    311.56,315.84
     They don't learn out of work. Let's go on. All right. Let's go on. All right
},
{
    315.84,322.16
     So in order again people are busy and they don't have time to watch our videos. They don't have time for pain
},
{
    322.6,325.32
     So that's why the seconds come in
},
{
    325.32,329.98
     We're gonna show you exercise that you can do it. It's only take a few seconds out of your hour
},
{
    330.5,335.24
     But we want you doing it a lot of times throughout the day five to six seven times a day
},
{
    335.44,338.42
     So take a few seconds work on it
},
{
    338.84,342.8
     Forget about it go back an hour later work on it again for a few seconds, right?
},
{
    342.8,350.04
     So you're gonna go through these exercises We're gonna find show you to get to improve that range of motion that you know you've lost
},
{
    350.2,356.16
     Or you want to regain it. Improve the range of motion it decreases the pain. Let's start off with the first one Brad extension
},
{
    356.16,362.64
     I'll do mine first. That's all right. Sure. So I like to use a towel with salvage on the end and that's a kind of a
},
{
    363.04,368.4
     Fitted end. I don't know if it's a sewing term or
},
{
    368.4,374.04
     what it is. Yeah we don't know but one way or another sounds English. So I got the edge of the
},
{
    374.04,379.12
     towel and I'm grabbing with my hands and you can see I'm a little bit of an angle here that's
},
{
    379.12,387.0
     because the joints angle this way and so it's actually gonna facilitate me moving back like this. Now once I have it in this direction
},
{
    387.0,392.2
     I like to be in a chair like Brad. I'm just showing here right now without the chair because Brad's in the chair
},
{
    392.2,396.84
     Yeah, and I'm gonna go ahead. I'm not just gonna go like this. I'm actually gonna go
},
{
    397.76,401.52
     Up with it. My eyes are following my thumbs
},
{
    402.68,407.32
     And eyes are following my thumbs and now if that hurts what I would try doing is
},
{
    407.32,413.64
     moving the level of the salvage down onto a different level of the neck to a
},
{
    413.64,417.6
     different vertebrae and then try it again and you're gonna find one of them
},
{
    417.6,421.6
     tends to work better than the other. Right, I mean you can usually get three or
},
{
    421.6,428.46
     four levels so I usually just kind of zigzag the towel back and forth and go down a little bit and it touches into the skin
},
{
    428.46,431.56
     You don't want to do it over your clothing right directly on this skin
},
{
    432.04,437.68
     And I'm pulling and going back and now actually lean into the back of the chair. Yeah sometimes as well
},
{
    437.8,442.28
     Absolutely, I lean back into the chair. Find the one that doesn't hurt go ahead do it
},
{
    442.28,446.4
     You know six to eight ten wraps and then you're done
},
{
    446.52,454.12
     And then you can do it again later in the day and do it throughout the day and you're gonna find out your pain levels eventually go down
},
{
    454.12,456.32
     So yeah, it's only gonna take you
},
{
    457.16,462.7
     Less than a minute, 30 seconds to go ahead and do it. So then you're gonna go ahead and show the Brad method here
},
{
    462.7,469.94
     So this one I've done this with a lot of people. I'll do Bob's method too, but sometimes if the person doesn't have good shoulder
},
{
    470.58,475.76
     Motion and that's hard for him. Or sometimes this will work just fine right off the bat
},
{
    475.76,481.86
     It's a little easier to instruct someone as I'll just have him roll up the towel in a bundle like this
},
{
    482.12,484.12
     Get it low on the neck
},
{
    483.68,484.36
     Roll up the towel in a bundle like this get it low on the neck
},
{
    487.62,487.92
     Back on the chair shoulders back and just have them
},
{
    493.48,494.2
     Let's say without the towel you get to hear it kind of hurts and then with the towel with the support
},
{
    499.52,502.36
     Snuggly tension here there you go. Oh boy that feels a lot better with this It does feel good and I use your method quite often Brad
},
{
    503.0,510.52
     So you can use bo's or mine You can comment which one you like better, but that'll work well and the same thing for frequency
},
{
    510.62,518.4
     Five, you know, maybe ten repetitions at the most but repeat that throughout the day as you regain more motion with less pain
},
{
    518.4,522.44
     The thing is you want to go further further further. That was the remember McKenzie
},
{
    522.44,525.04
     The end range is where the magic happens. Further further further further was the remember McKenzie. I don't remember the end range is where the magic happens
},
{
    525.04,527.04
     Further further further further they'd always say that
},
{
    527.88,531.04
     Instructor all right now we're gonna go into rotations and the same thing with this
},
{
    531.04,535.44
     I'd rather do it in a chair, but Brad's gonna show it in the chair. I'm doing it with salvage again
},
{
    536.08,539.92
     Right underneath the ears. I'm at the angle again, and what you're gonna do
},
{
    539.92,544.92
     I'm gonna work on rotation to the left so I drop this one down on the left side
},
{
    544.92,551.46
     I grab the one on the right side I pull down I pull this one out this one's not
},
{
    551.46,555.58
     going across like this because you won't be able to breathe and then you're
},
{
    555.58,561.3
     going to go ahead and pull it around like this as you're rotating and that's
},
{
    561.3,565.54
     going to help facilitate that motion now again you can try different levels with that
},
{
    565.78,567.78
     Brad do you want to show how you
},
{
    568.22,573.2
     Keep the shoulder back. Oh, yeah, so if I'm doing this one
},
{
    574.64,579.04
     See how my right shoulder is moving he wants to keep it back here
},
{
    579.04,581.3
     Sometimes people kind of lock their armor on the chair
},
{
    581.38,585.14
     Brad you were just mentioning earlier that you'd actually hold your patients like this
},
{
    585.14,588.38
     just to give them a feel of how it should feel without
},
{
    589.26,595.9
     Allowing the shoulder to go along with it. I tell them to imagine there's big claws holding your shoulders still and you can't move them
},
{
    596.22,599.12
     Sometimes people have that imaginary thing. Yeah that helps
},
{
    601.24,605.52
     Visualization, monster claws, nice claws. By the way, I don't think I've ever taught this
},
{
    605.52,609.84
     I was taught that if you're lacking motion in both directions you should be concerned that you might have
},
{
    609.84,617.6
     Ankylosing spondylitis. Oh really? Yeah. Don't get too concerned. I was just throwing that out there.
},
{
    617.6,624.08
     All right, so we worked on extension, we worked on rotations, you don't need to do both of them
},
{
    624.08,629.24
     You can just pick one, they're gonna work during the day, right and if one helps better
},
{
    629.36,635.08
     You do that one, right and then we're gonna do side bending now side bending you can do the same as
},
{
    635.28,637.28
     Extension you can use a towel and
},
{
    637.64,643.24
     Use the salvage if you want or you can do a Brad's method, but you want to be in really good
},
{
    644.96,650.16
     you can do a Brad's method, but you want to be in really good position Actually a lot of times, Brad, you want to show a lot of times I actually do a chin tuck even before
},
{
    650.16,657.32
     I do a side bend. First of all it's good posture, I'm gentle chin tuck, not really firing
},
{
    657.32,662.64
     But he's not going down, he's not going up, he's just going back, but that really puts you in right position
},
{
    662.64,671.1
     Right and then side bend and as you were mentioning Brad don't be doing this don't turn your head and go
},
{
    671.1,676.24
     like this, you want to actually put that ear on your shoulder and while
},
{
    676.24,682.36
     maintaining that in line. I often will try towards the painful side first if
},
{
    682.36,688.4
     you're having pain on this side I'll work on that side you can take your fingertips and actually give a little bit of stretch
},
{
    688.48,693.1
     Don't be grabbing with your whole big mitt there and grabbing your skull and pulling it over
},
{
    693.5,696.5
     It's a gentle, very gentle stretch
},
{
    697.24,704.3
     So those you know if you work on you find out which ones work for you work on them take only a few seconds
},
{
    704.3,706.86
     You know throughout your day, bundle together
},
{
    706.86,710.66
     And hopefully will knock your pain down. There you go. Thanks for watching
},
