     When my clients come in for treatment for some of their challenges like depression, anxiety, or relational problems,
},
{
    6.36,8.36
     one of the most common
},
{
    8.44,11.98
     associated problems that they have is difficulty sleeping.
},
{
    12.32,18.72
     This shows up as either having a hard time falling asleep, staying asleep, or just feeling tired all the time.
},
{
    19.48,25.36
     Getting enough quality sleep can make your brain function much better and you'll be better at solving
},
{
    25.36,28.32
     problems and feel more self-control.
},
{
    28.32,33.2
     In this video, we're going to talk about how to train your brain to sleep well and it's
},
{
    33.2,43.36
     called sleep hygiene.
},
{
    43.36,45.04
     Hi everyone, Emma McAdam here.
},
{
    45.04,49.24
     I'm a licensed therapist and I just wanted to remind you that I've got in-depth mental
},
{
    49.24,52.28
     health courses on Udemy.com.
},
{
    52.28,56.4
     Right now they're on sale for $9.99, so check out the link in the description.
},
{
    56.4,58.64
     Okay, back to sleep hygiene.
},
{
    58.64,61.96
     So sleep is essential for good mental health.
},
{
    61.96,65.46
     Lack of sleep can actually cause mental illness. Research
},
{
    65.46,70.38
     is showing that one of the most effective ways to treat depression is by
},
{
    70.38,76.22
     helping people improve the quality and the quantity of their sleep. One study
},
{
    76.22,81.12
     of people with depression found that after resolving their insomnia, 87% of
},
{
    81.12,85.82
     them experienced major improvements in their depression. Their depression symptoms
},
{
    85.82,89.92
     disappeared after 8 weeks of good sleep.
},
{
    89.92,97.04
     So how do we improve our ability to get sleep? We can train our brain to sleep better. Sleep
},
{
    97.04,101.76
     hygiene means going through a routine that trains your brain and body to know when to
},
{
    101.76,106.2
     sleep. So like a muscle that strengthens with practice, sleeping
},
{
    106.2,108.76
     well is a skill we can develop.
},
{
    108.76,112.68
     Okay, so because you're trying to trigger the autonomic nervous system to start your
},
{
    112.68,117.84
     sleep cycle, it's really important to use a routine. If you've ever tried to get a
},
{
    117.84,123.12
     toddler to fall asleep, you know how important it is to stick to a routine. Adults aren't
},
{
    123.12,127.16
     too different. Remember our minds like Pavlov's dogs,
},
{
    127.16,130.12
     they learn to associate sights, smells, and activities
},
{
    130.12,132.32
     with these reflexive responses
},
{
    132.32,135.52
     that are usually outside of our direct control.
},
{
    135.52,137.9
     We can't force ourselves to sleep,
},
{
    137.9,142.04
     but we can train our brain to know when to sleep.
},
{
    142.04,147.08
     So start by creating a wind down routine before bedtime that the brain
},
{
    147.08,153.04
     associates with sleeping. To do this, you want to keep a consistent schedule whenever possible.
},
{
    153.04,158.12
     So try to go to bed and wake up around the same time each day. Dim the lights, cool
},
{
    158.12,163.8
     the temperature and decrease your stimulation. So for example, do quiet activities like reading
},
{
    163.8,171.56
     a book or taking a bath because these help trigger calm. Don't watch TV or exercise right before bed. Another
},
{
    171.56,176.84
     thing you can do is have a routine for right before bed. So for example, in the evening
},
{
    176.84,181.96
     you do a snack and you change into pajamas, then you brush teeth and get into bed, read
},
{
    181.96,188.72
     a book, pray and go to sleep. In addition to a routine, there are some things you can do during the day that are going to
},
{
    188.72,193.26
     improve your ability to fall asleep and stay asleep.
},
{
    193.26,196.88
     Limit your naps during the day to less than 30 minutes.
},
{
    196.88,202.12
     Cut out screen time before bed so not only are devices like phones and tablets and TVs
},
{
    202.12,205.84
     very stimulating and this triggers the alerting
},
{
    205.84,207.68
     system in the brain.
},
{
    207.68,213.8
     But also the tone of the light emanated from your screen tends to have a bluish tint to
},
{
    213.8,218.04
     it and this is similar to the bluish light in the mornings.
},
{
    218.04,222.76
     So again this is a biological trigger to wake up.
},
{
    222.76,225.88
     Research shows that blue toned lights tend to trigger alertness
},
{
    225.88,232.24
     and red or yellow toned lights tend to trigger calmness. So if you must use your
},
{
    232.24,238.18
     phone or tablet before bed check to see if it has a night shift setting. This
},
{
    238.18,244.6
     will shift your screen colors toward the red and yellow range. Next turn your
},
{
    244.6,247.24
     screen brightness down as low as possible
},
{
    247.24,250.16
     and use the night setting for reading.
},
{
    250.16,252.92
     And this makes it so your text appears as white letters
},
{
    252.92,254.88
     on a black background.
},
{
    254.88,258.52
     So many programs have this option in their settings.
},
{
    258.52,260.8
     Also put your phone on do not disturb mode
},
{
    260.8,263.44
     while you're sleeping and don't check your work emails
},
{
    263.44,268.34
     right before bed or read anything that could be stressful like the news or even your
},
{
    268.34,273.32
     Facebook feed. Another thing you want to do is take a look at your caffeine use.
},
{
    273.32,279.08
     Avoid caffeine for at least four to six hours before bedtime. Even one cup of
},
{
    279.08,283.52
     coffee or tea even early in the morning that can affect your sleep for up to
},
{
    283.52,285.96
     48 hours. So if
},
{
    285.96,289.68
     you're not sure of how caffeine is impacting you, you could try going off
},
{
    289.68,294.52
     caffeine for one week. The first couple of days you might feel more tired and by
},
{
    294.52,298.88
     day four you'll probably start feeling better. You'll have better sleep, you'll
},
{
    298.88,304.2
     have better energy and be more focused and you'll most likely be waking up less
},
{
    304.2,306.48
     at night and you'll find it easier to
},
{
    306.48,312.72
     fall asleep. Within one week most people say I feel better off caffeine than on caffeine.
},
{
    312.72,316.56
     They report better energy, better mood, and better sleep.
},
{
    317.76,322.24
     Another thing you want to think about is limiting alcohol use. While some people believe that
},
{
    322.24,325.14
     alcohol helps them sleep, and it might help
},
{
    325.14,331.3
     people fall asleep, alcohol interferes with your brain's ability to sleep well and repair
},
{
    331.3,336.5
     itself, especially during the second half of the night. So that leaves you feeling more
},
{
    336.5,339.06
     exhausted later.
},
{
    339.06,343.84
     Another thing to think about is to avoid rich, heavy or fatty foods before bedtime. Anything
},
{
    343.84,346.04
     that might cause heartburn or indigestion
},
{
    346.04,349.36
     can interfere with sleep, but so can hunger.
},
{
    349.36,351.72
     So you could try a snack like a banana
},
{
    351.72,353.76
     and peanut butter before bed.
},
{
    355.12,357.48
     A warm glass of milk before bed has also been shown
},
{
    357.48,359.32
     in clinical studies to be as effective
},
{
    359.32,362.8
     as many sleep medications, but a lot of people
},
{
    362.8,365.72
     just don't like the idea of drinking warm milk.
},
{
    365.72,368.36
     You may want to try it.
},
{
    368.36,373.18
     Exercise during the day can also greatly improve your ability to sleep, so even 10 minutes
},
{
    373.18,375.88
     of exercise can make a difference.
},
{
    375.88,381.08
     Also light and sound can trigger alertness, so use earplugs, blackout curtains, or eye
},
{
    381.08,385.12
     masks to help cut out that extra stimuli.
},
{
    385.12,387.8
     Another thing you can try is a relaxation routine
},
{
    387.8,389.8
     or meditation before bed.
},
{
    389.8,392.32
     This is something like progressive muscle relaxation.
},
{
    392.32,394.36
     You could check out the video I made on that
},
{
    394.36,397.88
     or you could listen to a guided imagery exercise.
},
{
    397.88,400.56
     And again, as you're trying to create associations
},
{
    400.56,404.44
     for your brain to trigger that sleep response,
},
{
    404.44,407.76
     you wanna only use your bed for sleeping and sex.
},
{
    407.76,410.76
     If your brain associates your bed with watching TV
},
{
    410.76,413.0
     or working on your laptop, eating, paying bills,
},
{
    413.0,416.32
     and et cetera, your brain is gonna associate your bed
},
{
    416.32,419.0
     with alertness, not sleep.
},
{
    419.0,421.58
     If you're having a very hard time falling asleep
},
{
    421.58,426.16
     or falling back asleep, try getting up, get out of bed, and do something
},
{
    426.16,433.6
     really boring like listening to a boring audiobook or a dull documentary. Don't do anything too
},
{
    433.6,438.56
     stimulating. When I'm having a hard time sleeping, I like to listen to this show called Time Team,
},
{
    438.56,448.2
     where a bunch of British archaeologists try and dig to find, you know find history, but it's a pretty slow show and it helps me fall asleep.
},
{
    448.2,453.0
     Okay, I hope you found these tips helpful and if you liked this video, check out my other video called

{
    453.0,458.0
