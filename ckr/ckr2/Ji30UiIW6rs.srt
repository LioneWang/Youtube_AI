     Hi guys, Jason from MrFigio. Today I'm gonna show you the breathing exercises.
},
{
    4.48,8.88
     Before that, you need to loosen up some muscles, like your core muscles and the
},
{
    8.88,14.24
     ceratocentria and chest muscles as well and even neck muscles. If those muscles
},
{
    14.24,19.24
     are tight, it'll be quite difficult for you to expand your belly and your
},
{
    19.24,25.0
     recage as well, which is quite important for breathing so please watch the previous video and
},
{
    25.0,33.8
     follow follow me no god please no no first of all you need to know your limit
},
{
    33.8,45.0
     what I mean is how much you can draw in and how much you can let it out.
},
{
    50.5,56.0
     So that's my top and that's my bottom. And we're going to practice with maybe about 50% of your breath.
},
{
    56.0,60.0
     Initially, your breathing starts with your belly coming forward.
},
{
    60.0,63.0
     So your diaphragm goes down when you breathe in
},
{
    66.0,69.0
     and diaphragm going up when you breathe in and diaphragm going up when you breathe out
},
{
    73.0,75.0
     Now this is belly breathing
},
{
    75.0,78.0
     but a lot of people can't do the belly breathing properly
},
{
    78.0,81.0
     People with chest breathing do this
},
{
    84.0,90.72
     So for those people, my recommendation is to exhale all the air.
},
{
    91.12,97.28
     And after that you just relax without breathing in again. After getting all the
},
{
    97.28,106.86
     air out of the lungs, when you relax the air should automatically go into the lungs again and then that will push
},
{
    106.86,112.54
     your belly forward. If you can feel your tummy you know coming forward a little
},
{
    112.54,118.54
     bit you can just build up on that. What I mean is just breathe in, growing the
},
{
    118.54,126.48
     feeling, trying to grow that feeling as you breathe in. Okay I will show you again.
},
{
    132.44,138.2
     After exhaling all the air, if you hold your breath for a couple of seconds, your
},
{
    138.2,149.0
     belly will come forward and then you just breathe in to grow that feeling.
},
{
    151.0,152.0
     So that's the belly breathing.
},
{
    156.0,170.84
     So you need to be able to breathe without using your chest. And in the last video I told you your diaphragm is also made of muscles and tendons.
},
{
    170.84,173.32
     So we can train the diaphragm.
},
{
    173.32,178.56
     All you need to do is actually put some resistance when your diaphragm is going down.
},
{
    178.56,186.36
     So when you breathe in, your diaphragm goes down, which means it's contracting but if you put resistance by pushing this
},
{
    186.36,193.74
     paper roll against your stomach your diaphragm has to calm down against some
},
{
    193.74,198.96
     increased abdominal pressure so I'm pushing this down against my stomach
},
{
    198.96,201.76
     and breathing
},
{
    203.28,210.04
     it's a lot harder for me to breathe because my diaphragm has to work against increased
},
{
    210.04,211.48
     abdominal pressure.
},
{
    211.48,215.8
     So that's how you practice your belly breathing and training your diaphragm.
},
{
    215.8,221.2
     And this belly breathing is followed by the second phase of the breathing, rickage expansion.
},
{
    221.2,225.32
     At some point of the belly breathing, this recage starts to expand
},
{
    225.32,232.92
     out the side. I will show you. I put this paper roll against my recage.
},
{
    255.48,261.72
     So this paper roll starts to go like that as you can see. When you practice the second part of the breathing, you can put towel roll along the spine line
},
{
    261.72,265.12
     and it will help to open up the rucate and the chest as well.
},
{
    265.76,271.04
     Like I said, you need these back muscles contraction to open up the rucate. So when
},
{
    271.04,276.16
     you breathe like that, your belly comes forward first and then your rucate starts to follow.
},
{
    291.52,294.56
     Actually, you've got lungs and diaphragm going deeper on the backside, so you should feel the air filling in this part as well.
},
{
    294.56,298.0
     So you can feel some tightness, especially on the last two ribs.
},
{
    298.0,303.12
     Then, you need to loosen up that area and keep practicing.
},
{
    303.12,309.88
     And then the second phase of the breathing is followed by the last phase of breathing the upper rib expansion. To facilitate
},
{
    309.88,314.56
     this rib cage expansion you can actually even bring your shoulder blades in
},
{
    314.56,320.6
     towards your spine. I'm actually lying on my shoulder blades and that will push
},
{
    320.6,325.4
     the chest forward a little bit so that it can expand better.
},
{
    325.4,360.64
     And also tilt your head backwards a little bit and lift your chin up to open up the airway. Throughout this whole process you need to be able to feel your chest expanding going
},
{
    360.64,365.12
     out of the side rather than elevating. Because as I said if you
},
{
    365.12,371.82
     breathe correctly you end up having this thoracic extension going backwards
},
{
    371.82,377.92
     rather than going up as your back muscles open up your recage and pulling
},
{
    377.92,384.04
     your recage backwards. So you end up doing this kind of action at the end of
},
{
    384.04,385.0
     the breathing.
},
{
    396.36,398.44
     That's why I use this kind of towel roll
},
{
    398.44,401.8
     and you're bringing my recage or shoulder blades inwards
},
{
    401.8,405.84
     like that to open up the front part and then
},
{
    405.84,411.12
     create some little bit of thoracic extension. In sitting you can practice
},
{
    411.12,416.52
     this thoracic extension. First of all you put your forearms on the inside of your
},
{
    416.52,430.0
     knees and then you start from the belly breathing and as your recage expands, you push your forearms into your knees like that and then open up
},
{
    430.0,447.12
     the recage. I will show you. So in the middle of the breathing I start to push my arms backwards and bring my chest forward like that
},
{
    447.68,452.32
     to engage these back muscles that open up my recage.
},
{
    460.16,467.0
     Also you need to tilt your head backwards, push your head back as you do the last phase of breathing.
},
{
    489.04,495.32
     And you can engage your back muscles lying on your tummy. Basically you have your arms a little bit out to the side like that, not this going out
},
{
    495.32,496.68
     a little bit.
},
{
    496.68,500.24
     And then you're going to raise yourself up using your belly.
},
{
    500.24,506.48
     Of course it's going to be hard for you to breathe as your belly is kind of blocked here.
},
{
    506.48,512.4
     It can't really expand as much as it should, but your diaphragm is going against this strong
},
{
    512.4,516.28
     resistance, which will make it stronger.
},
{
    516.28,519.04
     So you don't need to push yourself up using your arms.
},
{
    519.04,525.46
     You don't need to exert through your upper body at all. All you need to do is breathing into your belly.
},
{
    531.38,535.98
     But you need to keep your shoulders down rather than up
},
{
    535.98,538.26
     and then bring your shoulder blades
},
{
    538.26,550.24
     kind of in towards your spine when you go up.
},
{
    555.08,560.6
     To sum up breathing starts with diaphragm going down and that pushes the belly forward and after that the lower recage starts to expand because those
},
{
    560.6,565.68
     back muscles start to contract so it it will open up the recage
},
{
    565.68,567.98
     by pulling the recage backwards.
},
{
    567.98,572.16
     And then the last phase will be upper recage expansion
},
{
    572.16,574.36
     with these back muscles
},
{
    574.36,577.94
     opening up the recage from the back as well.
},
{
    577.94,582.48
     And those muscle actions opening up the recage from the back
},
{
    582.48,584.64
     will eventually create this kind of
},
{
    584.64,590.86
     a bit of thoracic extension as well. So we need to loosen up the involved muscles and try
},
{
    590.86,595.56
     to facilitate those muscle function. I hope this video helps and I will see you
},
{
    595.56,597.98
     next time.
},
