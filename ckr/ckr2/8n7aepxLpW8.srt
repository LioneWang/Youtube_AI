     Bob and Brad the two most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    7.68,11.06
     Hi, I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist, Brad Heineck physical therapist
},
{
    11.06,14.42
     Together we are the most famous physical therapists on the internet, in our opinion Bob
},
{
    14.42,19.7
     Brad we already did a video on how the single best treatment for quadriceps tendonitis or a tear
},
{
    19.7,22.76
     And I'll link that right here, sure okay right there
},
{
    22.76,30.32
     But now we're gonna show you the three exercises that you want to do after the tear is starting to heal and you want to make sure you're putting some stress on the tendon
},
{
    30.32,34.76
     But not so much that it tears again, so it's controlled stress basically
},
{
    34.88,39.08
     So the first thing you're going to do and this is one you can probably start off with almost
},
{
    39.88,44.32
     Immediately is the straight leg raises because you're not putting a great deal of stress on it
},
{
    44.32,46.32
     You're going to show those Brad? Straight leg raises because you're not putting a great deal of stress on it. You're gonna show those Brad?
},
{
    47.24,49.24
     Straight leg raises times three
},
{
    49.68,55.76
     Okay, so this is the leg that we're working with I always like to keep the opposite leg bent and up in this position
},
{
    55.76,57.76
     And it gives a little more
},
{
    58.32,64.08
     Stability and we're just gonna keep the knees straight if you can't if it comes up and it goes like this and you can't keep it straight
},
{
    64.08,70.68
     It's probably not ready for it yet. So you're here and up and down good control up
},
{
    70.68,75.82
     Yeah, good control down and up to about a 45 is that what you say Bob?
},
{
    75.82,77.22
     I would say yeah
},
{
    77.22,82.9
     And and that's for the hip flexion right and some quad probably. Again, it's early on
},
{
    83.0,85.56
     But it's good to get that quadriceps so that you know
},
{
    85.56,90.8
     You can keep the knees straight and you really need to keep the knees straight for the whole ten of them before you
},
{
    90.8,96.36
     Go to the next exercise. Probably a good three to five seconds going up Brad. Oh a slow good
},
{
    96.36,100.18
     Yeah, you're probably really slow. You really want to slow and controlled here on this one
},
{
    101.48,109.34
     Normally we can do it that fast but on this one you want to keep it slow Even on a healthy quad I can feel him working. It's amazing. What a difference it makes
},
{
    109.34,111.82
     Alright then abduction
},
{
    111.82,116.86
     I'll do it facing this way
},
{
    116.86,126.44
     Okay so now would be we're doing ab or ad? Ab, okay So I keep the bottom one and then I'm gonna go
},
{
    126.44,130.32
     The bottom is bent and he again is keeping and you want to keep
},
{
    130.76,135.14
     Over on your side, you don't want to lean this way too far or this way
},
{
    135.64,139.32
     There you go, and again three to five seconds Brad nice and controlled
},
{
    140.4,144.48
     And watch where my toe is, it's good now, but if you find yourself doing this
},
{
    144.88,145.92
     Yeah, you're cheating
},
{
    145.92,149.72
     That's cheating get it over like this. Toes pointed to the side to the wall
},
{
    150.84,157.56
     2001, 2002, 2003 these are hard aren't they? Oh, yeah now this isn't working the quad a lot
},
{
    157.56,160.8
     It's working more up here, but you need to work the whole leg, right
},
{
    161.32,166.88
     It's working the IT band a little bit here here and then adduction is the last one Brad
},
{
    169.52,171.52
     Now watch your mic on that one
},
{
    172.6,176.16
     So now we're gonna work the muscles on the inner thigh
},
{
    176.68,182.44
     This one's not doing work stabilizing. I need to get over more. I'm gonna squish my mic holder
},
{
    182.44,185.56
     So I'm gonna cheat a little bit there for that reason and
},
{
    187.48,192.56
     Same thing keep you know three to five seconds and keeping the toes straight forward
},
{
    196.98,202.82
     And again these are much harder when you do them than what you're seeing if you haven't done them
},
{
    202.82,211.12
     Especially when you do slow good control with good mechanicser for me Brad because I got long legs. Sure. All right next thing I do
},
{
    211.12,216.88
     I do like to put a little bit of a stretch on the muscle and you can kind of do that you know
},
{
    216.88,221.92
     you can do it this way I'm stretching this is the one I have trouble with actually and you can
},
{
    221.92,225.28
     stretch I'm stretching a little hip flexor but I'm getting the quad here, too
},
{
    231.52,231.88
     But you can also and again you keep good posture and just a real gentle stretch don't bounce at all on this right
},
{
    238.12,241.56
     You're just gonna keep stretch. I think there's some people that say don't stretch your you know torn muscle I really think you got to do it gently, right?
},
{
    241.56,244.44
     I again I'm going through this right now
},
{
    244.44,248.44
     And I found that I do like to keep it slightly stretched out and you can also do
},
{
    248.44,254.4
     this one, just a gentle stretch. Try to realign those fibers, I think
},
{
    254.4,257.44
     that all makes sense. All right now we're gonna go ahead and move this out of the way
},
{
    257.44,259.64
     Brad.
},
{
    261.96,268.84
     All right now you can start off with just take a 2 by 4, this is not 2 by 4, this is
},
{
    268.84,270.32
     what 2 by 6's?
},
{
    270.32,271.32
     1 by 6's?
},
{
    271.32,273.32
     They're 1 by 4's I would think.
},
{
    273.32,274.32
     Alright, 1 by 4's.
},
{
    274.32,278.0
     So we're going to have 3 inch and a half high.
},
{
    278.0,282.96
     Yeah, and you can go higher actually if you want, but I don't know if you can catch that
},
{
    282.96,283.96
     long or not.
},
{
    283.96,285.52
     I'll put it all
},
{
    285.52,290.24
     way back here and this is just gonna make it a lot easier to stay in control
},
{
    290.24,297.3
     but you put your heels on there and let's say this is the trouble, the one I'm
},
{
    297.3,300.8
     having trouble with, so you're gonna go ahead and you're gonna lower yourself down
},
{
    300.8,304.16
     and you're gonna sit way back like you're sitting on a chair because you're
},
{
    304.16,309.46
     trying to make sure the knee stays over the toes, not beyond the toes. You want to show Brad?
},
{
    309.46,311.46
     Yep, I got a board right here
},
{
    312.72,317.0
     So if I go down if I go like this I'm going way in front of the toes
},
{
    317.0,319.2
     I want to stay back like this
},
{
    320.08,325.28
     You can see it's like you're doing a squat with weights on but no bar over your shoulders
},
{
    325.28,329.1
     Okay, now the thing is you want to do three to five seconds going down
},
{
    331.4,336.46
     And three to five seconds going up actually you probably just want to do these centrics to start off with so
},
{
    336.76,340.42
     What we're gonna do is I'm gonna show you this too though by the way
},
{
    343.04,346.68
     Getting ahead of myself here Brad. I can see that. That's all right. All right
},
{
    346.68,352.46
     What I'm gonna do is first I want to make sure you're not going knees in. Right. I want to make sure you're not going knees out
},
{
    352.46,354.46
     You're keeping them straight over the toes
},
{
    354.6,355.76
     Okay
},
{
    355.76,359.4
     And then how far you go down is gonna be by how far you are in the rehab
},
{
    359.4,366.24
     You may want to start off real shallow. Right and the second thing is you probably want to start off with what we call eccentric
},
{
    366.6,373.02
     Strengthening, so I'm strengthening this one, so on the way down you can even lean a little bit more on this one and go down on this one
},
{
    373.02,378.06
     The injured one, and then going up you can lean over onto the right and push up with the right one
},
{
    378.06,382.06
     Brad you had also mentioned that people could use a cane
},
{
    382.6,385.42
     You could go down like this and then push up
},
{
    385.42,389.12
     Right just for some balance take some stress off or a chair
},
{
    389.12,392.68
     You could push up with a chair if you have both legs that are giving you trouble
},
{
    392.68,396.14
     Then you have to have two chairs set up so that you can push up on the way up
},
{
    396.56,398.56
     So again three to five seconds down
},
{
    400.04,402.04
     Push up
},
{
    402.4,405.16
     You can squeeze your butt a little bit too sure as you get up
},
{
    406.44,410.08
     Again no sharp pains if you got sharp pains. It's too early for it
},
{
    410.44,416.22
     The one though that I have found that worked better than this Brad is if you want to invest into a physio ball
},
{
    417.92,423.48
     What else you call these exercise ball exercise ball physio ball this worked much better for me
},
{
    423.48,425.7
     It just it was a lot easier for me to do.
},
{
    425.7,426.36
     Sure.
},
{
    426.36,431.96
     I can keep my toes way out like this and I just slowly went down like this Brad.
},
{
    432.18,436.34
     I'm just really in control. Keeping the same mechanics, the same rules.
},
{
    436.46,441.82
     It's just so easy to stay in control here with this. I just I like this so much better.
},
{
    442.32,448.84
     And even with the ball, depending on you might use a cane that you could hold for balance
},
{
    448.84,452.44
     If you want to do a centric, just do a centric you can go
},
{
    453.12,457.48
     Down like this or you can lean to the right going up and take the pressure off of it
},
{
    457.72,460.2
     So I'm putting the pressure on the left one on the way down
},
{
    460.76,464.44
     And I'm putting the pressure on the right one on the way up. That's what I've been doing at home
},
{
    464.72,467.4
     That's a good technique, I like that
},
{
    467.4,473.6
     Eventually if you're a heavy-duty athlete and a heavy-duty weightlifter
},
{
    474.04,477.44
     You may want to go, this simulates our big bar, right?
},
{
    478.24,485.06
     These are each 45 pounds, yeah, these are those titanium plates you can see through, right
},
{
    485.64,489.18
     So anyway what you're gonna want to do is you're gonna eventually can do some squats
},
{
    489.18,491.68
     If you know the proper technique for squats
},
{
    491.8,495.92
     You can put some heavy weight on you and you can just do some real slow squats
},
{
    495.92,501.44
     And that's supposed to be actually very good for a quadricep tendonitis or tear
},
{
    501.88,506.18
     If you're ready for that phase of it. Right, that's near the end of the rehab
},
{
    506.56,513.08
     Now how often, if you're doing like the ball on the wall and stuff like that you can do that every day
},
{
    513.08,514.68
     You can even do it twice a day
},
{
    514.68,517.64
     That's how often you can do it. You're not gonna get too aggressive
},
{
    517.64,520.64
     You got to let your body rehab, I guess it's an individual thing
},
{
    520.64,524.74
     It is, that's a very good point Brad because you got to listen to your body and see how it's doing
},
{
    524.8,528.14
     But if you're doing squats, I wouldn't do those more than twice a week
},
{
    528.46,532.42
     Yeah, heavy squats, right, but you're exactly right Brad
},
{
    532.42,535.82
     This is all experiment for you got to figure out what works for your body
},
{
    535.82,539.66
     I found out that this worked better for me than doing it on the board
},
{
    540.26,543.16
     Maybe other people are gonna like the board better, so right
},
{
    543.38,546.78
     All right, if you haven't already make sure you subscribe because it would make us happy
},
{
    546.78,552.96
     Right, well yeah, and not only that we're gonna give more information like this, right? Yeah, I think we are, thanks
},
