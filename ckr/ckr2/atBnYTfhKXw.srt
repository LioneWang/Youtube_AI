     So, what do you do if you find an unconscious person?
},
{
    7.24,11.68
     Say you're walking down the street and you see someone laying on the floor or you come
},
{
    11.68,15.62
     home and a family member or a friend is on the floor.
},
{
    15.62,20.6
     The first thing you're going to do is you're going to assess for safety of the scene.
},
{
    20.6,24.04
     You want to make sure that if there's something that put this person in this position, you
},
{
    24.04,26.4
     don't want that same thing to put you in the same position because you're
},
{
    26.4,31.76
     not any help to anybody if you're also unconscious. And then you go up to the person and you say,
},
{
    31.76,35.92
     are you okay? Can you hear me? Everything okay? You know, kind of like we see on the
},
{
    35.92,40.44
     movies. Annie, Annie, are you okay? You want to check to see if there's any kind of, if
},
{
    40.44,45.88
     they're breathing, if they have a pulse and you can check on their elbows, on their wrists,
},
{
    45.88,48.72
     on their neck, up here, you can check on their neck.
},
{
    48.72,50.56
     And if they are, then you wanna see
},
{
    50.56,52.12
     if there's any other kind of trauma,
},
{
    52.12,54.08
     where they hit in the head.
},
{
    54.08,56.2
     Was there anything nearby that may have hurt them?
},
{
    56.2,57.64
     Did they trip on something?
},
{
    57.64,60.72
     Is there anything around, is there alcohol all around?
},
{
    60.72,62.88
     And maybe they just had a lot of too much fun last night,
},
{
    62.88,64.76
     something like that, you wanna make sure
},
{
    64.76,68.02
     you can see what's around and if you can try to figure it out.
},
{
    68.02,72.64
     If you suspect any kind of head injury or especially neck injury, if you suspect any
},
{
    72.64,77.34
     kind of neck injury or spinal injury, you're not going to want to move your friend, okay?
},
{
    77.34,80.82
     Keep them as they are still, call 911 and wait for help.
},
{
    80.82,84.74
     Monitor to make sure that they're breathing, that they have a pulse and stay on the line
},
{
    84.74,87.9
     until the ambulance gets there. If the person is vomiting or
},
{
    87.9,92.9
     there's fluids coming out and you feel comfortable that there wasn't a neck or a
},
{
    92.9,95.86
     spine injury then you're going to want to put them in the recovery position. And
},
{
    95.86,99.98
     the same thing again, you're going to want to bend their knee, roll them over,
},
{
    99.98,109.32
     and then bring their arm over this way. And that way their head is to the side and any kind of fluids or vomit or anything that's
},
{
    109.32,113.72
     coming up will fall out of the mouth onto the floor and they won't choke on it.
},
{
    113.72,116.84
     The recovery position is very simple.
},
{
    116.84,117.84
     I can't say it enough.
},
{
    117.84,118.84
     It's very simple.
},
{
    118.84,119.84
     It can save someone's life.
},
{
    119.84,123.96
     If someone's unconscious, you just lift their knee, roll them over and roll them to the
},
{
    123.96,124.96
     side.
},
{
    124.96,129.32
     It can save your friend's life by just one simple move of rolling their body over to
},
{
    129.32,129.8
     the side.
},
