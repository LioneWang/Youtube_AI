     This is here with registernurserian.com and in this video I'm going to go over some tips on
},
{
    4.56,10.08
     how to deal with those patients who have difficult veins. As a nurse, it is inevitable that on a
},
{
    10.08,15.36
     daily basis you're going to encounter those patients that are difficult to draw blood from or
},
{
    15.36,20.96
     star IVs and there's various reasons that this happens. Some reasons could be your patients
},
{
    20.96,25.6
     just severely dehydrated so those veins are not popping up or they have
},
{
    25.6,30.96
     severe cardiac or renal disease. So what I want to do is I want to give you some tips on how to
},
{
    30.96,36.24
     deal with those things. The first thing what you want to keep in mind is that usually on most patients
},
{
    36.24,41.84
     they're going to have something for you to use for drawing blood or starting an IV even though it
},
{
    41.84,48.96
     doesn't look like it initially or the patient tells you, you know, I'm a really hard stick, but usually most patients will have something that you can
},
{
    48.96,55.52
     access. So with these patients, you're really going to be going by palpation of that vein
},
{
    55.52,61.12
     rather than actually seeing it. Like, you know, on patients who are healthy, they do a lot of
},
{
    61.12,65.6
     cardiovascular exercise, those veins are nice and superficial at the surface.
},
{
    65.6,68.2
     Once you apply that tourniquet, they just pop up there.
},
{
    68.2,70.56
     On patients who have bad veins, that doesn't happen.
},
{
    70.56,74.6
     You'll put the tourniquet on there and those veins really just don't pop up as great as
},
{
    74.6,78.12
     someone who has those nice and gorgeous veins.
},
{
    78.12,83.12
     You have to know, number one, the location of your veins.
},
{
    83.12,86.24
     In the adult, they're usually the same across the board, like the median
},
{
    86.24,90.88
     cubital, the accessories to foul. You're just going to find those in the same location. So be
},
{
    90.88,96.24
     familiar where you can find these veins. Second, what you have to do is you have to practice
},
{
    96.24,103.12
     feeling veins. And veins feel very unique compared to other structures in the arm. So what I like
},
{
    103.12,105.56
     to do is I like to take my index finger
},
{
    105.56,108.76
     and I like to start feeling all throughout my arm,
},
{
    108.76,111.24
     the front, the back, everywhere I can,
},
{
    111.24,113.24
     especially on these patients whose veins
},
{
    113.24,115.28
     just aren't popping up.
},
{
    115.28,118.16
     Because veins have a very unique feel in that
},
{
    118.16,120.8
     they're squishy but bouncy.
},
{
    120.8,123.38
     And once you get the feel of what they feel like,
},
{
    123.38,125.68
     you will never confuse it for other structures and arm
},
{
    125.68,131.22
     But whenever you're first starting out, it's very foreign because you know, I remember starting out and filling on an arm
},
{
    131.22,136.44
     I'm like, what is that? Is that a vein and then my preceptor be like, no, that's like a tendon or a ligament
},
{
    136.44,137.48
     I'll be like, oh, okay
},
{
    137.48,141.44
     So what you can do what worked for me is that I would take a tourniquet
},
{
    141.56,146.0
     Apply it to my own arm and I would feel my veins, or I would use
},
{
    146.0,150.96
     my husband or a friend or a family member, whoever was healthy who had great veins, and I would just
},
{
    150.96,156.56
     feel throughout the arm and get comfortable with how that vein would feel. Next, you want to use
},
{
    156.56,162.08
     two things. You want to use a tourniquet and gravity. Both of these things are going to benefit
},
{
    162.08,165.68
     you greatly when trying to start IVs or draw blood on these
},
{
    165.68,170.8
     people who have difficult veins because it's like the same concept with the water hose. Once you kink
},
{
    170.8,174.72
     that water hose and put a lot of pressure on it, what does that water hose start to do? It starts
},
{
    174.72,179.92
     to swell and that's what these veins are going to do because we need that once we go in there to
},
{
    179.92,187.12
     palpate to fill that swollen squishy bouncy vein so we can stick it. So what I like to do is I
},
{
    187.12,191.76
     like to put the tourniquet on the upper arm, not too tight but not too loose, just right.
},
{
    191.76,197.28
     Have the patient drop the arm by the side and pump that fist just open and close that hand
},
{
    197.28,202.88
     over and over and this gives a time for that blood to pull in that lower part of the arm
},
{
    202.88,205.68
     so you can increase your chances of getting a vein.
},
{
    205.68,212.0
     And the thing is it's really amazing how taking the time to just do those two simple things
},
{
    212.0,216.8
     really does work. Now I worked in a stress lab for many years and right off the bat whenever the
},
{
    216.8,221.36
     patient comes to you for the test they have to have an IV and I would get a lot of patients who
},
{
    221.36,229.28
     would tell me you know people will hardly ever can stick me successfully. It takes multiple tries. I just don't have anything. And, you know,
},
{
    229.28,234.64
     looking at their arm initially, they really didn't have anything. But once I applied that
},
{
    234.64,241.04
     tourniquet, used gravity for my benefit, it was just simply amazing what actually popped up and was
},
{
    241.04,246.42
     available for me to use. It would shock me and shock the patient and we'd usually get it first try
},
{
    246.42,248.7
     and the patient would be like, wow, that never happens.
},
{
    248.7,254.06
     So always try to use those two simple things to help you with drawing blood and getting IVs.
},
{
    254.06,259.08
     And lastly, you know, sometimes you can put the tourniquet on, you can use gravity all day,
},
{
    259.08,263.26
     you can palpate all day, stick the patient, you're just not getting anything.
},
{
    263.26,269.52
     And this is where you need to use those outside resources. There's vein lines available, maybe your unit has one that can help
},
{
    269.52,274.96
     illuminate the vein so you can easily find it. Or in other situations, depending on what you have
},
{
    274.96,281.52
     available at your facility, you can have ultrasound come, ultrasound the arm, find that vein and stick
},
{
    281.52,286.32
     them for IVs and places I've worked we've had that and I'll share a story
},
{
    286.32,290.8
     with you. We had a patient coming in for a stress test and they were like you know I need a central
},
{
    290.8,295.44
     line to have this test and you know going and getting a central line is expensive for the patient.
},
{
    295.44,301.52
     There's risk of infection and all these issues just to have like this four hour test really an
},
{
    301.52,305.52
     IV is the best route. So we called ultrasound, they came up, they
},
{
    305.52,309.92
     ultrasound the arm and they found a vein. It was deep down in the bend of the arm, but there was
},
{
    309.92,314.56
     a vein there. Sergeant IV got it, person had their stress test and we saved them from having to get
},
{
    314.56,320.32
     a central line and that was great. So always look and see what your hospital has available for those
},
{
    320.32,326.48
     situations that do arise. But if you do have a patient, you know, you're just not getting
},
{
    326.48,330.32
     anything on them, they're going to be there because they're really sick. They need a lot of treatment
},
{
    330.32,334.72
     with IV fluids. You probably want to get with the physician, explain what's going on, because that
},
{
    334.72,339.92
     patient may be a candidate for a central line and do that instead. Okay, so that is what I like to do
},
{
    339.92,343.76
     whenever I have those patients who have those difficult veins. And I hope those tips help you
