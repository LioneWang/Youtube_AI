     Check the scene for safety.

{
    16.64,20.36
     For a child, obtain consent from a parent or guardian if present.
},
{
    20.36,22.88
     Then check the person for responsiveness.
},
{
    22.88,25.8
     If the person doesn't respond, call for help.
},
{
    25.8,29.64
     If the person is face down, gently roll the person face up,
},
{
    29.64,32.92
     keeping the head, neck, and back in a straight line
},
{
    32.92,34.52
     so you can provide care.
},
{
    38.84,40.76
     Once the person is on her back,
},
{
    40.76,44.72
     open the airway by using the head tilt, chin lift technique.
},
{
    45.8,51.52
     To perform the head tilt, chin lift technique. To perform the head tilt, chin lift technique, place one hand on the forehead and two fingers
},
{
    51.52,53.76
     on the bony part of the chin.
},
{
    53.76,57.36
     Then tilt the head back as you lift up on the chin.
},
{
    57.36,59.12
     Maintain this position.
},
{
    59.12,63.56
     For a child, do not tilt the head back as far as you would for an adult.
},
{
    63.56,66.44
     Check for breathing for no more than 10 seconds.
},
{
    66.44,70.68
     Look to see if the person's chest clearly rises and falls.
},
{
    70.68,73.96
     Listen for escaping air from the mouth and nose.
},
{
    73.96,76.88
     Feel for escaping air against the side of your face.
},
{
    76.88,81.44
     Normal, effective breathing is quiet, regular, and effortless.
},
{
    81.44,84.56
     In an unconscious adult, you may detect an irregular,
},
{
    84.56,86.16
     gasping, or shallow breath.
},
{
    86.88,92.08
     This is known as an agonal breath. Do not confuse this with effective breathing.
},
{
    92.08,94.64
     Care for the person as if there is no breathing at all.
},
{
    96.24,101.6
     If an adult is not breathing, quickly check for severe bleeding, then begin chest compressions.
},
{
    103.84,107.2
     If a child is not breathing, give two rescue breaths,
},
{
    107.2,109.96
     one after the other, before checking for bleeding
},
{
    109.96,112.36
     and giving care for the conditions you find.
},
{
    112.36,115.22
     Use a CPR breathing barrier if available.
},
{
    116.44,118.76
     Tilt the head back and lift the chin up.
},
{
    120.12,123.24
     Then pinch the nose shut and make a complete seal
},
{
    123.24,124.62
     over the child's mouth.
},
{
    124.62,127.3
     Blow gently for about one second.
},
{
    127.3,131.8
     Each breath should make the chest clearly rise.
},
{
    131.8,137.7
     If the chest does not rise, retilt the child's head and try another rescue breath.
},
{
    137.7,140.7
     After two successful rescue breaths,
},
{
    140.7,145.0
     quickly scan the body for severe bleeding and care for the conditions you find.
},
{
    145.0,152.0
     If at any time an unconscious person begins vomiting, the airway could become blocked.
},
{
    152.0,158.0
     Roll the person onto one side and then use a finger to clear out the mouth.
},
{
    158.0,166.8
     Once the mouth is clear, continue to provide care based on the conditions you find. If the person is unconscious but breathing,
},
{
    166.8,170.5
     maintain an open airway with the head tilt, chin lift technique,
},
{
    170.5,173.3
     and monitor breathing and for any changes in condition
},
{
    173.3,176.0
     until EMS personnel take over.
},
{
    182.5,187.56
     If you cannot maintain an open and clear airway because of fluids or vomit, place the person
},
{
    187.56,192.42
     in a modified Hain's recovery position by moving the person to her side while keeping
},
{
    192.42,198.76
     the head, neck, and back in a straight line with the knees bent.
},
{
    198.76,203.9
     If you need to leave the scene to call 911, modify this position by tucking the hand under
},
{
    203.9,None
     the head.
