     Bleeding control training is of utmost importance in the pediatric population.
},
{
    7.84,12.76
     In those age 1 to 17, injury is a leading cause of mortality.
},
{
    12.76,16.48
     So understanding how to control bleeding is of huge importance.

     A ternicate is a device that is used on an extremity and it provides a circumferential,
},
{
    22.08,25.18
     a pressure around the extremity that stops that blood
},
{
    25.18,30.32
     flow and so blood can't flow through the extremity to the area that is bleeding.
},
{
    30.32,34.16
     Turnickets can only be used on arms or legs and if there's life-threatening bleeding there,
},
{
    34.16,37.72
     putting the tourniquet on and tightening it will put pressure on that extremity.
},
{
    37.72,41.44
     For all other wounds, use direct pressure and that basically means taking your hand and
},
{
    41.44,44.28
     available material if you have gauze, great.
},
{
    44.28,46.88
     If you don't, a t-shirt, newspaper, necktie,
},
{
    46.88,48.68
     whatever you have, you push that on the wound
},
{
    48.68,50.04
     and then push as hard as you can on it.
},
{
    50.04,52.0
     And so those are the two basic ways
},
{
    52.0,54.08
     that you can apply pressure for life-threatening bleeding.
},
{
    54.08,55.64
     Unfortunately, accidents happen
},
{
    55.64,57.8
     and they happen around the home every day.
},
{
    57.8,60.76
     Bleeding to death can occur within a couple of minutes
},
{
    60.76,62.12
     with a severe bleed.
},
{
    62.12,64.6
     This can be before EMS providers arrive.
},
{
    64.6,66.24
     Blood that is spurting
},
{
    66.24,71.36
     from a wound, blood that is pooling on the ground, if the person is starting to get faint or pale
},
{
    71.36,75.68
     appearing. These are signs of life-threatening bleeding and this is when a tourniquet should be
},
{
    75.68,84.8
     applied. Everyone can learn how to use a tourniquet and they can be used to save a life.
