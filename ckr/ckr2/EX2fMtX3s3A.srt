     In this video, let's go over how to fix shoulder blade pain in 30 seconds.
},
{
    4.6,5.6
     Stay tuned.
},
{
    5.6,6.6
     Hey, everyone.
},
{
    6.6,13.72
     Dr. O here at SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan.
},
{
    13.72,17.44
     So I'm going to go over some different exercises that are going to help relieve a lot of pain
},
{
    17.44,19.34
     in between the shoulder blades and upper back.
},
{
    19.34,24.56
     So make sure to try all of them, experiment with them, see which one helps you the most.
},
{
    24.56,27.84
     With these exercises, they don't require any special equipment.
},
{
    27.84,29.88
     They can be done at home or at work.
},
{
    29.88,33.8
     They're just really simple and easy to do, and I really do hope they give you a lot of
},
{
    33.8,34.8
     relief.
},
{
    34.8,38.84
     So with the first exercise, we're going to need a wall or a door, any flat surface.
},
{
    38.84,41.08
     I'm going to be in this position right here.
},
{
    41.08,49.92
     So my bottom leg is at 90 degrees, so my knee is straight with my hip. And then this one is also at 90 degrees. Whatever side is facing the wall, you want
},
{
    49.92,55.6
     to completely flush with the wall. So my ankle, my knee, my hip, my shoulder are all against
},
{
    55.6,60.88
     the wall. I'm going to place the arms straight that's against the wall like this. And then
},
{
    60.88,69.92
     I'm going to take my other one and just kind of go into like I'm going to like clap almost and then this is the first part of this exercise. We're
},
{
    69.92,75.28
     going to lean forward with the shoulders kind of like rounding them forward to
},
{
    75.28,79.68
     open up the shoulder blades in the back. So when I do this you should definitely
},
{
    79.68,86.76
     start to feel a very good stretch into the upper back. Hold this one for about 10 to 15 seconds.
},
{
    86.76,89.32
     Relax, do it a couple times.
},
{
    89.32,91.88
     So this is the next part, and this is the great thing
},
{
    91.88,95.0
     about this thoracic mobility exercise.
},
{
    95.0,97.0
     What I'm going to do is lean forward again
},
{
    97.0,99.48
     until I feel a very good stretch in there.
},
{
    99.48,102.0
     And then what I'm going to do is slowly rotate
},
{
    102.0,103.96
     the upper back like this.
},
{
    103.96,105.6
     I'm taking the arm away from me,
},
{
    105.6,107.96
     and I'm following it with my head.
},
{
    107.96,110.44
     Go back as far as you feel comfortable,
},
{
    110.44,113.6
     and hold that for upwards to 10 to 15 seconds.
},
{
    113.6,117.72
     Relax, come back, and then repeat that three to five times.
},
{
    117.72,120.8
     That's gonna put a very good stretch into the upper back.
},
{
    120.8,122.04
     So with this next one,
},
{
    122.04,125.12
     you're going to use a door or a wall also.
},
{
    125.12,126.72
     It's pretty easy to do.
},
{
    126.72,131.72
     What you want is your feet about shoulder width apart and put your toes about a foot
},
{
    131.72,134.52
     or so away from the door of the wall.
},
{
    134.52,138.44
     Then put your arms like this at 90 degrees and lean into the door.
},
{
    138.44,142.32
     So use your arms right here to really stabilize your upper back.
},
{
    142.32,146.68
     You want a very nice upright posture when you do this.
},
{
    146.68,152.44
     So what I'm going to do is take one arm and bring it down like this and then slide towards
},
{
    152.44,154.52
     the opposite direction.
},
{
    154.52,158.56
     And you're going to feel a very good stretch in between those shoulder blades.
},
{
    158.56,161.52
     Only go as far as you feel comfortable with.
},
{
    161.52,165.32
     And hold that for upwards to 10 to 15 seconds.
},
{
    165.32,171.76
     So I'm just kind of leaning and rotating towards the opposite direction when I do this.
},
{
    171.76,175.24
     And again, it's going to put a lot of mobility into the upper back.
},
{
    175.24,176.44
     It's going to feel really good.
},
{
    176.44,178.2
     It's going to loosen things up.
},
{
    178.2,183.6
     So I just keep repeating this about five times on each side.
},
{
    183.6,186.76
     Again only going to my comfort level
},
{
    186.76,189.0
     and it should help quite a bit
},
{
    189.0,191.68
     with loosening up the upper back, so give it a try.
},
{
    191.68,194.16
     So this next one you can do seated.
},
{
    194.16,197.96
     What you want to do is get in a nice upright posture,
},
{
    197.96,200.72
     take your hands, put them behind your head like this,
},
{
    200.72,204.24
     and then start to go into flexion or leaning forward.
},
{
    204.24,207.76
     You want a very nice stretch in the upper back to begin with.
},
{
    207.76,210.16
     And then I hold this for about 5 to 10 seconds.
},
{
    210.16,214.28
     I'm going to then come back, place my upper back against the back of the chair and then
},
{
    214.28,220.64
     slowly wing my elbows backwards while I lean my head and upper back into extensions or
},
{
    220.64,222.28
     into a backwards movement.
},
{
    222.28,226.0
     You're going to feel a very, very good stretch in between the shoulder blades.
},
{
    226.0,228.0
     You should almost feel like your shoulder blades
},
{
    228.0,231.0
     are pinching together this time around.
},
{
    231.0,234.0
     And you want to hold that one for about 15 seconds.
},
{
    234.0,236.0
     Get a nice stretch into the chest,
},
{
    236.0,238.0
     the packed muscles in the front,
},
{
    238.0,240.0
     and feel a very good stretch in between the shoulder blades
},
{
    240.0,241.0
     in the back.
},
{
    241.0,243.0
     And then just come back,
},
{
    243.0,246.36
     repeat the process of leaning forward, slowly come back into
},
{
    246.36,250.6
     extension, wing those elbows back until you feel a very good stretch, a very comfortable
},
{
    250.6,251.84
     stretch in the upper back.
},
{
    251.84,255.08
     Again, hold that one for 15 seconds or so.
},
{
    255.08,257.24
     Relax, do it three to five times.
},
{
    257.24,260.6
     With all of these, they're going to put a lot more motion into the upper back, loosen
},
{
    260.6,268.2
     up the rhomboids, which are primarily the big cause for a lot of issues in between those shoulder blades and just get you feeling better all the
},
{
    268.2,271.2
     way around. So give them a try I hope they help. If you liked the video and it gave
