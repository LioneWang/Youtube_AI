     Jackson, can you get that board out of the way for me?
},
{
    3.0,6.0
     Jackson, Jackson, can you hear me?
},
{
    6.0,8.0
     Jackson, squeeze my hands if you can hear me.
},
{
    8.0,10.0
     Okay, we need an ambulance. Can you call triple zero?

     A spinal injury should be suspected in any casualty
},
{
    13.0,17.0
     who loses consciousness as a result of a head injury.
},
{
    17.0,20.0
     I'm going to need your help, boys. We need to turn him over onto the side.
},
{
    20.0,22.0
     Should we really be moving him? Wouldn't it?
},
{
    22.0,27.76
     Yeah, he's unconscious and we need to make sure he keeps breathing. The airway takes priority over the spinal injury
},
{
    27.76,32.32
     and the unconscious casualty must always be turned onto their side.
},
{
    32.32,37.36
     When turning these casualties, care must be taken to maintain spinal alignment
},
{
    37.36,39.36
     and minimise twisting.
},
{
    39.36,42.64
     This can be achieved by performing a log roll.
},
{
    42.64,45.68
     To perform a log roll, you will need yourself and two
},
{
    45.68,50.84
     bystanders. Okay boys I need you down that end to hang on to the ankle and the hips.
},
{
    50.84,55.84
     Your hip and shoulder and we're going to turn him over and keep him nice and straight. On
},
{
    55.84,63.06
     the count of three boys, one, two, three. Gently roll the casualty in unison into the
},
{
    63.06,64.68
     side recovery position.
},
