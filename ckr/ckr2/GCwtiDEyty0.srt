     Welcome to Strength Side. This is Strength Side Friday and today we're talking
},
{
    3.96,10.88
     about anterior pelvic tilt and lumbar lordosis coupled with thoracic kyphosis
},
{
    10.88,17.36
     or upper back rounding. So this is sometimes too postural defects or
},
{
    17.36,22.96
     issues that we think of as one or the other but sometimes these accompany
},
{
    22.96,25.36
     each other and come together. So we get kind of
},
{
    25.36,32.96
     poor pelvic control, anterior pelvic tilt, lardosis here, extreme lardosis here, and then
},
{
    32.96,39.68
     it's kind of coupled with this shoulders forward, upper spine rounded, maybe forward head as well.
},
{
    40.48,46.22
     So basically what's happening is, you know, this natural curve of your spine and this
},
{
    46.22,51.7
     loridotic curve in the lumbar spine, which you naturally have, gets too extreme, right?
},
{
    51.7,53.3
     It goes too far one way.
},
{
    53.3,58.5
     That's coupled with the natural kyphosis curve that you have in the upper back going too
},
{
    58.5,60.7
     extreme the other way, okay?
},
{
    60.7,65.2
     So our spine is basically curving too much at the bottom and the top
},
{
    66.44,71.06
     so What we kind of see a lot of the time from individuals who have this issue is
},
{
    72.08,74.08
     that
},
{
    74.92,76.2
     You know
},
{
    76.2,79.92
     When you're so I'm gonna use sitting as an example because so many people
},
{
    80.72,88.88
     Come to this by sitting right so you're, you're maybe doing something on the computer, you notice that you're in a poor position
},
{
    88.88,89.72
     and what do we do?
},
{
    89.72,94.72
     We go like this and we try to basically over correct this.
},
{
    94.96,98.44
     So we think now we're in a better position.
},
{
    98.44,100.72
     But really, all we're really doing here
},
{
    100.72,104.04
     is taking our spine from flexion to extension.
},
{
    104.04,109.84
     We're flaring the rib cage up, going from a rib cage tucked down to now flared up, and
},
{
    109.84,118.68
     basically we're just creating a lot of instability in our spine and more
},
{
    118.68,124.72
     specifically kind of this thoracolumbar part of the spine here, right? So we're
},
{
    124.72,127.2
     here and then we pop up here, right?
},
{
    127.2,134.12
     And we think this is a good position, but really we are not setting ourselves
},
{
    134.12,141.24
     neutral like we should be and then letting our shoulders and hips kind of be
},
{
    141.24,152.6
     in a stable position where they should be as well. So what we have to do is find a way to just get ourselves into more of a neutral position,
},
{
    152.6,157.3
     okay, and not go too extreme back the other way.
},
{
    157.3,162.66
     So one of the things that's very helpful to find this good position is just to put your
},
{
    162.66,165.4
     hands kind of right underneath your chest
},
{
    165.4,166.4
     here, right?
},
{
    166.4,167.88
     And your sternum area.
},
{
    167.88,171.68
     And what you're doing here is you're making sure that your rib cage does not pop up or
},
{
    171.68,173.12
     flare up, right?
},
{
    173.12,175.4
     We don't want this to happen.
},
{
    175.4,178.38
     That's going to be too much extension in the lower back.
},
{
    178.38,182.12
     So we keep the hands here to make sure that does not happen.
},
{
    182.12,187.64
     And then from here, all we're going to do is we're going to drive our chest and our neck backwards. We're going
},
{
    187.64,194.52
     to keep our chin tucked and now we're setting ourselves in a more optimal
},
{
    194.52,200.32
     position. Okay? We're getting more flexion in the lumbar spine through keeping
},
{
    200.32,210.64
     our abs engaged and keeping this rib cage pulled down and then we're getting more extension in the upper spine through you know driving our neck
},
{
    210.64,217.22
     kind of into retraction and same with the chest area kind of pulling this
},
{
    217.22,222.92
     backwards okay so basically we're reversing these extremes that we've
},
{
    222.92,229.6
     created in our body okay so that's the position that we want to strive for, but before we can
},
{
    230.32,237.44
     effectively use that in everyday life, there's some exercises slash stretches that we can do
},
{
    237.44,241.12
     to just make ourselves more comfortable with getting into that position,
},
{
    241.12,246.2
     activating the muscles that should be activated to hold those positions
},
{
    246.2,248.48
     while you're going through everyday life,
},
{
    248.48,250.76
     sitting, standing, walking, all that good stuff.
},
{
    250.76,252.4
     So let's get to the exercises.
},
{
    252.4,257.04
     So for these exercises, we will be regressing our position
},
{
    257.04,259.76
     to get into a position where your body
},
{
    259.76,261.72
     doesn't have to support itself so much,
},
{
    261.72,270.48
     so you can really focus on what is going on in your body to achieve this better postural position. So we're gonna start on
},
{
    270.48,276.72
     our backs and you can pop your feet up onto whatever you got right. I got this
},
{
    276.72,281.88
     little blue Ikea chair here that I put together myself actually took me a while
},
{
    281.88,288.36
     and basically we're just searching for around 90 degrees at the knees, 90 degrees at the
},
{
    288.36,289.36
     hips.
},
{
    289.36,292.76
     As long as you're close to that, then you should be fine.
},
{
    292.76,296.4
     If you don't have anything to put your feet up on, just go ahead and stack them like this
},
{
    296.4,300.12
     like you were going to do a glute bridge.
},
{
    300.12,304.76
     From here, what I'm going to do is really hard exercise.
},
{
    304.76,307.44
     I'm just going to sit here and breathe.
},
{
    307.44,308.6
     Seriously.
},
{
    308.6,309.44
     So,
},
{
    310.84,313.08
     what we are trying to achieve here
},
{
    313.08,316.4
     is we're trying to achieve this flat back
},
{
    317.72,320.04
     posteriorly tilted pelvis.
},
{
    320.04,323.12
     So this makes our rib cage kind of line up
},
{
    323.12,324.32
     to our pelvis here,
},
{
    324.32,327.44
     which creates the advantageous position
},
{
    327.44,330.08
     for our diaphragm to work, okay?
},
{
    330.08,332.28
     And now what you have to consider
},
{
    332.28,333.88
     is that when you're standing up,
},
{
    334.96,337.7
     the position that your spine wants to go to,
},
{
    337.7,339.56
     it's this rounded position.
},
{
    339.56,343.08
     When I'm laying back and letting gravity take my body down,
},
{
    343.08,345.32
     now I'm able to let my spine
},
{
    345.32,350.8
     extend down to the ground here, okay? I can't sit here like this. If you find
},
{
    350.8,354.32
     yourself sitting here like this, then let yourself relax. Let those shoulders go
},
{
    354.32,360.24
     down and get that head down to the ground. Now what I want you to do is focus on a
},
{
    360.24,368.82
     big inhale and as you inhale I want you to feel like you are inhaling into
},
{
    368.82,376.5
     the back of your rib cage and that it should be more so just pushing into the
},
{
    376.5,378.74
     ground.
},
{
    391.4,396.28
     So your spine will naturally extend as you inhale and then flex as you exhale. And this is very, very small changes in your spine.
},
{
    396.28,409.36
     But we want to think about that and we want to use that to when we're inhaling, I'm doing that same motion of driving my sternum, neck, upper back, into
},
{
    409.36,417.28
     the ground, making sure that I'm very straight here, then I can exhale away.
},
{
    417.28,424.68
     So we can just sit here and take breaths for a minute, up to five minutes, whatever feels
},
{
    424.68,426.0
     good to you.
},
{
    426.0,431.24
     So from here, we're going to kick this chair out of the way, we're going to hop into a
},
{
    431.24,435.44
     quadruped position, and then we're going to rock back onto the heels.
},
{
    435.44,441.32
     Okay, now we're going to bring the elbows down to the floor, and from here what we're
},
{
    441.32,446.04
     going to do is we're going gonna practice that same position of driving
},
{
    446.04,454.76
     through my sternum neck area, pushing my head back, tucking my chin, and we're just gonna
},
{
    454.76,465.68
     sit into this position you should really feel your upper back
},
{
    466.96,468.52
     start to
},
{
    468.52,475.38
     activate and fatigue. Now it might feel a little weird, especially if you've been in that hunchback position for a long time.
},
{
    475.56,480.36
     This is going to be reversing the curvature of your spine. It's going to be
},
{
    482.4,485.0
     sort of just making you more familiar
},
{
    485.52,489.14
     with what it feels like to go back the other way
},
{
    489.14,490.44
     into extension.
},
{
    490.44,493.12
     And because I got my hips back locked in here,
},
{
    493.12,496.92
     I can't get that extension through my lower spine, okay?
},
{
    496.92,498.66
     So make sure to keep these tucked,
},
{
    499.76,502.66
     push that head up and we breathe.
},
{
    506.84,507.68
     Perfect.
},
{
    507.68,511.36
     So that transitions us into the last exercise,
},
{
    511.36,513.94
     which is just to come up into quadruped.
},
{
    513.94,515.24
     And now we're gonna do the same thing,
},
{
    515.24,517.08
     but this is gonna be a little bit more challenging
},
{
    517.08,519.2
     because now, as you can see,
},
{
    519.2,523.38
     I can really tilt my pelvis too far into this extension.
},
{
    524.32,526.22
     So now I gotta manually lock this in
},
{
    526.22,528.02
     by keeping my abs braced.
},
{
    528.88,532.68
     And I'm going to push through my sternum,
},
{
    534.16,536.98
     neck up to the ceiling.
},
{
    539.88,541.84
     Gonna keep my chin tucked.
},
{
    544.2,546.26
     I'm just gonna breathe into this position.
},
{
    551.84,553.84
     If you start to feel yourself drift
},
{
    553.84,557.52
     into rounding up or back, just correct.
},
{
    557.52,559.6
     Push yourself up.
},
{
    559.6,562.08
     If you start to feel you getting too much tilt
},
{
    562.08,565.0
     in the pelvis. Just correct.
},
{
    565.0,568.2
     Pull that thing under to tighten up the abs.
},
{
    571.2,576.04
     And we can just breathe in this position for another
},
{
    577.0,579.06
     however long feels comfortable for you.
},
{
    580.06,583.0
     I would suggest one to five minutes.
},
{
    583.0,585.66
     So those are a few exercises that you can use
},
{
    585.66,589.96
     to get more comfortable with being in this
},
{
    590.92,593.02
     stacked spine position.
},
{
    593.02,595.4
     Because really that is, at the end of the day,
},
{
    595.4,596.28
     what we're looking for.
},
{
    596.28,600.32
     We're looking for our rib cage to sit over our hips,
},
{
    600.32,602.36
     for our shoulders to sit over our rib cage
},
{
    602.36,604.88
     and for our neck to kind of just sit
},
{
    604.88,606.8
     right into that shoulder region.
},
{
    606.8,610.92
     So when we start to get here, that's going to affect everything.
},
{
    610.92,614.4
     When we start to get here, that's going to affect everything.
},
{
    614.4,620.56
     So we put the hands on the sternum and we drive that neck and chest backwards, right?
},
{
    620.56,625.92
     This is the position that we are trying to achieve just to have a good neutral posture.
},
{
    625.92,630.72
     Right now it may be challenging, but the more that you go through these exercises, the more
},
{
    630.72,636.94
     this will become a little more natural and your body will be able to get there without
},
{
    636.94,639.14
     so much conscious effort.
},
{
    639.14,640.84
     That's what we want in the long run.
},
{
    640.84,642.56
