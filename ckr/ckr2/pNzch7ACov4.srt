     Bob and Brad the two most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    8.8,13.36
     Hi, I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist. Hi Bob, Brad Heineck physical therapist
},
{
    14.44,18.92
     And together we have the most famous physical therapists on the internet. Oh in our opinion of course Bob
},
{
    18.92,24.12
     I didn't watch that movie or whatever it was. Today we're gonna talk about heel spurs right Brad? Home treatment
},
{
    24.12,25.52
     Yes, what you can do at home
},
{
    25.52,31.38
     Do it yourself, exactly because there are a number of things you can do at home without going to the doctor and going through all the
},
{
    31.94,37.84
     Hops and stuff and have success. First let's talk about heel spurs, can you put your foot up Bob?
},
{
    38.52,42.82
     Okay, that's fine just turn this way there like that
},
{
    43.1,48.94
     Heel spurs typically form right in this part of the foot right by the calcaneus that big bone there
},
{
    48.98,52.74
     So if we look at underneath his skin and then we tear that off and here we go
},
{
    52.78,55.5
     We got our skeleton bone apart the other way now
},
{
    55.58,61.58
     Yep, turn the other way the red bands represent the plantar fascia or some real strong connective tissue
},
{
    62.62,68.18
     Yep, and as you walk they spread and they get pulled and they get a lot of pressure and they pull
},
{
    68.22,73.4
     Where they connect up to this bone and they can actually pull away from that bone in a micro sense
},
{
    73.4,78.68
     And what the body does to heal that puts calcium deposits on there and starts to form
},
{
    78.96,89.84
     Calcium and bone the same thing starts to form bone, extra bone and they're shaped like a spur pointed and this blue putty here reprimands this is a pretty big bone
},
{
    89.84,93.92
     spur here but they can get pretty big you can see we see them on x-rays
},
{
    93.92,98.48
     actually and once you get that bone spur that can cause problems keep in mind
},
{
    98.48,102.92
     people can have bone spurs and not have pain right so if you see x-rays on your
},
{
    102.92,107.88
     foot and you got bone spurs Don't necessarily freak out because there's plenty of people that don't
},
{
    107.88,112.86
     It follows along the tendon as Brad was saying and it won't necessarily give you
},
{
    112.86,116.38
     trouble but if it is these are some things you can try. So we need to loosen up
},
{
    116.38,120.16
     the tissue in here, so Bob can you bring your foot up, if you loosen up the
},
{
    120.16,124.24
     tissue get the work, so one way to do it is you can just go ahead and take your two
},
{
    124.24,130.98
     thumbs and go ahead and spread them apart like this and give them a massage to your foot. Oh boy my
},
{
    130.98,137.64
     foot sensitive. I'm not touching that thing. Yeah, you can work along you know up here where the
},
{
    137.64,143.92
     spur would be and you can go ahead and make sure that the tissue is as pliable as possible.
},
{
    143.92,145.22
     And he's getting in pretty deep
},
{
    145.22,147.22
     Your thumbs are gonna get tired quick
},
{
    148.22,153.88
     I'm feeling this. Yeah, okay. If your thumbs get too tired you can take a tennis ball. Sure
},
{
    153.88,158.78
     Okay, this isn't a tennis ball, but it's the same shape. It's a cross ball. Can you see this lani down here?
},
{
    160.16,163.96
     So you can go ahead and start working it that way. You can do it one of two ways
},
{
    163.96,165.92
     One you can just put pressure on it
},
{
    166.36,171.26
     For like 12 seconds up to a minute or you can start rolling it back and forth like this
},
{
    171.26,173.76
     If you get to a real tender spot
},
{
    173.76,177.92
     You're probably going to want to stay away from that real tender spot and work around it
},
{
    177.92,179.92
     Yeah work around it is exactly right
},
{
    180.08,183.32
     Work on the spots that are less tender at first to stretch out the band
},
{
    183.56,185.08
     So there's a variety of things
},
{
    185.08,189.44
     Bob was talking about pressure hold it for 12 to 30 seconds then move up a little bit.
},
{
    189.44,191.44
     Yeah another
},
{
    192.32,195.04
     12 seconds to a minute. Right and then
},
{
    195.52,199.2
     You can work that in various locations if you want to try doing a
},
{
    199.5,207.2
     Cross massage like you do doing with your thumbs with the ball. That's an option and then also I like to go forward and backwards
},
{
    207.92,212.74
     And you do what works for you because there's different theories and
},
{
    213.88,219.64
     Yeah, just figure out what works for you. That's what comes down here. Now if the ball does seem work good work
},
{
    219.64,226.56
     It's work good for you. There's a device here. This is made by massage track. It's called the body track
},
{
    226.56,229.68
     We're not gonna spend a lot of time on it. It's nice about that as you can do one ball
},
{
    229.68,232.8
     But with this you can actually do two balls. Sure two for the work
},
{
    233.28,239.68
     Different the balls can be different widths apart. These are two wider tracks and two narrower tracks
},
{
    240.32,246.62
     And you can actually work the foot that way too. We've got a video just on this if you want Bob's gonna link up to it.
},
{
    246.62,249.7
     I'll link it right there baby. Okay, and the final thing is
},
{
    250.58,257.48
     Get yourself a different pair of inserts that are inside your shoe. Where's your shoe Bob? Right here
},
{
    258.0,261.28
     Depending on the kind of shoe you wear, like this type of shoe address
},
{
    261.28,265.94
     Who almost never has an insert that you can pull out. I don't know. Yours is glued in
},
{
    266.18,270.08
     But if you have an insert that you can go to the store. I've got some spinco ones here
},
{
    270.08,273.04
     I find they're a pretty good product. I've used them for years
},
{
    273.28,277.96
     But use whatever whatever trips you trigger you can go to Rogans or a shoe store and they'll you have a
},
{
    278.52,285.6
     wide variety and you just got a shoe for that one. Yeah, that's all right Bob, it doesn't matter, go ahead take that one out.
},
{
    285.6,292.4
     So you're gonna get an insert that's cushioned and you may or may not need more of an art support,
},
{
    292.4,295.84
     it depends if you're flat footed you may not want an art support, it's gonna be too much
},
{
    296.88,301.52
     in the shoe, you're gonna have to experiment with that. One thing I do like to have is soft,
},
{
    301.52,310.16
     if you have an art support in there it should have some give to it I don't like rigid hard arch supports. I'm not a big fan of those either. I like to have some flexibility with that
},
{
    310.32,316.52
     So unfortunately, I can't say go and get this specific arch support for your foot. You have to kind of experiment
},
{
    317.96,320.48
     To be honest with you what I do is I take them out of the box
},
{
    320.48,323.94
     I put them on the floor and I put my foot on it and see how it feels
},
{
    323.94,329.62
     out of the box I put them on the floor and I put my foot on it and see how it feels I know but still if I buy them and then you have to take them back because
},
{
    329.62,333.12
     it's the wrong one but if you work with this a little bit I know which ones I
},
{
    333.12,335.96
     need now because I've worked with it for a while as a matter of fact I've got I
},
{
    335.96,340.1
     got about six eight old ones I keep the old ones because you never know if I
},
{
    340.1,344.36
     need them for another project I got with my other shoes and we just I just had a
},
{
    344.36,346.6
     couple laying around that my wife used for plantar fasciitis
},
{
    346.6,353.72
     too for the same reason. Sure, yep. So you can work and they're usually about 20 to 30 dollars if you get a pair of custom ones made
},
{
    353.82,359.14
     They're about 300-400 dollars and if they work it's great and if they don't
},
{
    359.14,365.48
     You're all 200-300 dollars. So it's a good option for that. It's nice to take a few bucks and spend and
},
{
    365.48,370.2
     these might just do as well as the custom-made ones. Yep, oh sure I've
},
{
    370.2,375.12
     experienced that. Anything else Bob? Nope, just remember we can fix just about
},
{
    375.12,378.88
     anything except for a broken heart but we've been working on that and then just
},
{
    378.88,382.32
     before we try to do things with stapler but didn't work but we'll keep going.
},
{
    382.32,384.84
     Thanks
},
