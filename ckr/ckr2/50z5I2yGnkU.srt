     In this video, we're going to go over how to self-correct whole back posture using no equipment. Stay tuned.
},
{
    10.4,14.88
     Hey everyone, Dr. Roe coming to you from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. In this video,
},
{
    14.88,20.0
     we're going to go over some great full back posture exercises that will help improve bad posture
},
{
    20.0,25.76
     and also maintain good posture. These are meant to be done as daily mobility exercises. All of
},
{
    25.76,30.48
     these exercises hit the back just a little bit differently. Go through them all, take what works
},
{
    30.48,35.84
     best for you. As a bonus, they can all be done at home and do not require any equipment and may
},
{
    35.84,41.84
     give quick back pain relief costs from bad back posture. So let's get started and fix that bad
},
{
    41.84,46.44
     posture right now. So here is a great daily posture exercise
},
{
    46.44,48.0
     that you can do first thing in the morning
},
{
    48.0,49.72
     or before you go to bed.
},
{
    49.72,52.12
     I call this the bed-back builder.
},
{
    52.12,53.2
     Very easy to do.
},
{
    53.2,54.92
     We're going to start off on our stomach
},
{
    54.92,56.12
     and we're going to slide forward
},
{
    56.12,59.28
     till our shoulders and head are off the edge of a bed.
},
{
    59.28,62.56
     This exercise has four different dynamic movements in it
},
{
    62.56,65.08
     that are really going to help strengthen the muscles
},
{
    65.08,68.18
     that hold us upright and hopefully will improve posture.
},
{
    68.18,70.08
     So let's start off with the shoulders and head
},
{
    70.08,71.64
     off the edge of that bed.
},
{
    71.64,74.0
     I'm going to do a simple neck retraction
},
{
    74.0,76.28
     to put our neck into better posture.
},
{
    76.28,78.18
     Take two fingers, put them on the chin
},
{
    78.18,80.32
     and drive the whole head up towards the ceiling.
},
{
    80.32,82.0
     You should really feel the muscles in the neck
},
{
    82.0,83.16
     start to activate.
},
{
    83.16,85.5
     You're going to hold this position throughout the exercise.
},
{
    85.5,89.16
     So with the first movement, I'm going to take my arms, straighten them, overlap my hands
},
{
    89.16,91.96
     just like this and put them on the small of the lower back.
},
{
    91.96,95.4
     We want to wing the elbows up towards the ceiling as much as we can.
},
{
    95.4,99.28
     You'll feel a very good activation of the muscles in the shoulder blades, upper back,
},
{
    99.28,100.28
     into the neck themselves.
},
{
    100.28,102.28
     So really focus on feeling that.
},
{
    102.28,105.98
     You want to hold this for about five seconds, but if you want more of a challenge,
},
{
    105.98,108.26
     you can hold these for a little bit longer,
},
{
    108.26,110.42
     10, 15 seconds if you'd like.
},
{
    110.42,111.94
     The next movement what I'm going to do
},
{
    111.94,113.66
     is straighten my arms at the elbow
},
{
    113.66,117.54
     and put my arms roughly 45 degrees towards my side.
},
{
    117.54,119.66
     From there I'm going to lift my arms up,
},
{
    119.66,121.1
     my fist towards the ceiling.
},
{
    121.1,122.78
     When you do this, you're going to feel the muscles
},
{
    122.78,125.0
     in the back just get activated a little bit differently.
},
{
    132.2,132.4
     Again, five second holds. From there, I'm going to turn my hands and then point my arms 90 degrees straight away from the body.
},
{
    137.58,137.92
     Let's make a hitchhiker sign just like this and then lift our hands up towards the ceiling again.
},
{
    141.28,141.4
     Again, you'll feel the muscles in the upper back just get hit a little bit differently.
},
{
    147.24,148.52
     Five second hold. From there, we're going to take our arms in front of us so they're pointed roughly 45 degrees and do the same thing.
},
{
    148.52,150.04
     Lift the arms up towards the ceiling
},
{
    150.04,152.64
     as much as we can to activate those muscles.
},
{
    152.64,153.7
     Five seconds.
},
{
    153.7,155.68
     With the last part, I'm going to take my hands,
},
{
    155.68,157.12
     place them on the back of the head.
},
{
    157.12,159.28
     We're really going to lift the head up as much as we can
},
{
    159.28,160.6
     and then we need the elbows up
},
{
    160.6,162.76
     and then we're going to lift our chest
},
{
    162.76,169.28
     as much as we can off the edge of that bed. You want to hold this one for five seconds really focusing on feeling
},
{
    169.28,173.64
     it into the neck and upper back. From there you can take a breather but we
},
{
    173.64,178.04
     want to go in reverse at this point so I'm going to go like this, like this,
},
{
    178.04,183.56
     taking my arms towards the side and then just start where we began with. But you
},
{
    183.56,185.02
     want to do this nice and slowly
},
{
    185.02,187.72
     for about three to five complete repetitions.
},
{
    187.72,189.3
     And with each repetition,
},
{
    189.3,191.32
     challenge yourself by lifting the arms up
},
{
    191.32,194.52
     just a little bit more to help strengthen those muscles
},
{
    194.52,196.04
     and improve your posture.
},
{
    196.04,198.04
     So here is a wonderful exercise
},
{
    198.04,200.3
     that's going to focus on full back posture.
},
{
    200.3,203.74
     We just need a flat, elevated surface like a chair.
},
{
    203.74,206.48
     You can also use the edge of a desk or a bed.
},
{
    206.48,210.44
     I'm also going to start off on my knees, so make sure to put a pillow or towel underneath
},
{
    210.44,212.16
     it for extra comfort.
},
{
    212.16,213.16
     Let's go up to that flat surface.
},
{
    213.16,218.08
     What I'm going to do is bend my elbows like this, place the backside of my arms, the tricep,
},
{
    218.08,220.62
     flat against the surface for a stable anchor point.
},
{
    220.62,224.44
     My hands are going to go right on my upper back or my shoulders like this.
},
{
    224.44,228.28
     Let's do a simple chin tuck also that is taking the chin down towards the chest
},
{
    228.28,232.56
     as much as we can. The movement from here is very easy. Let's start off with what
},
{
    232.56,237.92
     is known as a back opener. So I'm just going to as a whole body movement
},
{
    237.92,241.6
     pretty much from my upper back to my lower back. I'm moving my butt down
},
{
    241.6,246.48
     towards my heels. The more that you go down the more that you're going to feel it really open into the upper
},
{
    246.48,250.5
     back all the way down to the tailbone, it usually feels really good.
},
{
    250.5,253.26
     Focus on trying to stretch into this as much as you can.
},
{
    253.26,257.46
     Once we hit a very comfortable stretch, let's hold this one for about 20 to 30 seconds.
},
{
    257.46,259.42
     Do nice, slow, controlled breathing also.
},
{
    259.42,260.42
     Let that tension out.
},
{
    260.42,264.34
     When you need a breather, just relax by coming back up like this.
},
{
    264.34,265.12
     On the next repetition,
},
{
    265.12,269.76
     try to stretch into it just a little bit more. And as a note, you get a little bit better results
},
{
    269.76,274.56
     if you focus on just letting the chest right here sag forward down towards the floor. Really try to
},
{
    274.56,278.8
     open up the upper back as much as you can. How we're going to take this one to the next level
},
{
    278.8,283.92
     is incorporate in a little bit more thoracic rotation into it and strengthening the upper back.
},
{
    283.92,288.02
     What I'm going to do is just lift one elbow up and then wing it up towards the ceiling.
},
{
    288.02,292.28
     Pretty much from my lower back to my upper back is rotating or turning up towards the
},
{
    292.28,293.28
     ceiling.
},
{
    293.28,295.96
     You're going to feel a lot of muscles activate into the upper back.
},
{
    295.96,299.14
     You want to hold this one for about 5 to 10 seconds.
},
{
    299.14,302.76
     From there you're just going to relax, take a breather, and just do this one on the other
},
{
    302.76,303.76
     side.
},
{
    303.76,306.28
     Do this for about 10 repetitions on both sides.
},
{
    306.28,309.08
     Again, challenging yourself with each repetition,
},
{
    309.08,311.92
     get more into it, and hopefully strengthen those muscles
},
{
    311.92,313.72
     and improve posture.
},
{
    313.72,315.72
     In the last part, let's focus a little bit more
},
{
    315.72,318.12
     into the lower back with a wonderful exercise
},
{
    318.12,319.88
     known as a bird dog.
},
{
    319.88,322.4
     So what I'm going to do is put my fist together like this.
},
{
    322.4,325.72
     I should say my hands together and create a V with my arms.
},
{
    325.72,329.64
     I'm going to use that to stabilize my upper body just like this.
},
{
    329.64,331.04
     Let's do that chin tuck.
},
{
    331.04,332.88
     The movement from here is very easy.
},
{
    332.88,334.8
     My knees are bent roughly at 90 degrees.
},
{
    334.8,338.0
     I'm going to straighten one leg away from me like this.
},
{
    338.0,341.0
     So my knee is straight, my toes are pointed away from me.
},
{
    341.0,347.92
     You should start to feel an initial stretch, or I should say activation of the muscles in the back of the leg and also the glute. Once we feel
},
{
    347.92,351.88
     that what we want to do is take that straight leg and slowly raise it up
},
{
    351.88,356.56
     until you feel a really good amount of activation into the core muscles, the
},
{
    356.56,360.56
     lower back, glubudox and legs. You should really feel this one into the core.
},
{
    360.56,364.2
     Strengthening the core is one of the best things that you can do to improve
},
{
    364.2,366.36
     pelvic and lower back posture.
},
{
    366.36,369.04
     Hold this one for about five to 10 seconds, relax,
},
{
    369.04,371.32
     take a breather, and then just simply repeat it
},
{
    371.32,372.8
     on the other side.
},
{
    372.8,375.32
     You want to do this one nice and slowly
},
{
    375.32,379.04
     for about 10 to 15 repetitions on both sides.
},
{
    379.04,381.52
     Again, with each repetition, try to build more into it
},
{
    381.52,385.0
     to hopefully strengthen the lower back and improve posture.
},
{
    385.0,392.0
     An overlooked cause of bad rounded back and shoulder posture is because of tight chest muscles that draw us forward.
},
{
    392.0,399.0
     Here is a great two-part exercise that's going to help reduce a lot of chest tightness while also helping to strengthen the upper back.
},
{
    399.0,402.0
     In the first part, we're going to do a basic chest opener.
},
{
    402.0,406.62
     I like to start off by doing a neck retraction. Take two fingers, place them on the chin,
},
{
    406.62,408.44
     draw the chin and head backwards
},
{
    408.44,410.6
     until you feel a very good activation
},
{
    410.6,412.04
     of the muscles into the neck.
},
{
    412.04,415.04
     From there, we're going to go to a corner of a wall.
},
{
    415.04,417.92
     Bend your elbows like this at about 90 degrees.
},
{
    417.92,419.96
     Put your feet together and then just stabilize
},
{
    419.96,422.72
     off to the side of the corner right here with your arms
},
{
    422.72,425.3
     and lean forward with your body weight.
},
{
    425.3,426.56
     The more that you lean forward,
},
{
    426.56,428.96
     the more that you're going to feel a very great stretch
},
{
    428.96,431.36
     into the chest, but you'll also feel the shoulder blades
},
{
    431.36,433.08
     in the back start to pinch together.
},
{
    433.08,434.68
     Focus on feeling that.
},
{
    434.68,437.04
     Once you hit a very deep but comfortable stretch,
},
{
    437.04,439.64
     let's hold this one for 20 to 30 seconds.
},
{
    439.64,441.96
     From there, you're just going to relax, take a breather,
},
{
    441.96,444.68
     and then repeat this one three to five times.
},
{
    444.68,448.96
     With each repetition, stretch into it just a little bit more to get a little bit better
},
{
    448.96,451.64
     stretch and hopefully loosen those chest muscles up.
},
{
    451.64,455.24
     I also like to experiment with just doing a little bit different motions.
},
{
    455.24,459.2
     So instead of going with a field goal position, I'm going to make a wide position with my
},
{
    459.2,462.2
     arms and then just simply repeat this exercise.
},
{
    462.2,465.84
     You'll notice that the muscles get hit just a little bit differently.
},
{
    465.84,468.64
     For me, it's a little bit more on the top part of the chest.
},
{
    468.64,472.08
     I'll also do a W with my arms and do the same thing.
},
{
    472.08,473.72
     Go through those three movements.
},
{
    473.72,476.6
     Whatever one that you feel just hits your tightness
},
{
    476.6,479.64
     a little bit better, throw more reps in at that point.
},
{
    479.64,481.36
     And the second part we're going to do
},
{
    481.36,483.04
     a little bit more for the upper back,
},
{
    483.04,485.32
     even more so in between the shoulder blades.
},
{
    485.32,487.36
     This is known as a shoulder blade lift off.
},
{
    487.36,489.76
     We can do this one next to a door or a wall.
},
{
    489.76,494.6
     I'm going to put my feet together, space them away from that door or the wall so my legs
},
{
    494.6,499.16
     are straight but my body is angled towards that door or the wall and we can press into
},
{
    499.16,500.72
     it with our feet and legs.
},
{
    500.72,504.96
     We want to position our body to the point where our hips through the back of the head
},
{
    504.96,509.48
     are flush against that door or the wall. Let's do a slight chin tuck also
},
{
    509.48,513.88
     for better posture. From there I'm going to bend my elbows at 90 degrees, put them off
},
{
    513.88,519.54
     to my side and press into the door until I feel an initial tension into my upper back.
},
{
    519.54,524.24
     The movement from here is very easy. We're going to press into the door with our elbows,
},
{
    524.24,530.24
     with our arm strength to lift our body forward. Our whole body is going to lift off, so we're not trying to round
},
{
    530.88,535.84
     our back forward to lift it off, but use our arm strength to activate those muscles into the back
},
{
    535.84,540.8
     to press forward. I feel a lot of firing. You're going to feel it into the chest, the shoulders,
},
{
    540.8,546.6
     upper back. It's a wonderful exercise, but you want to hold this one for about five seconds.
},
{
    546.6,550.88
     From there, you're just going to relax, take a breather, and then repeat this 10 to 15
},
{
    550.88,551.88
     times.
},
{
    551.88,554.78
     With each repetition, try to drive yourself forward even more.
},
{
    554.78,559.96
     Challenge those muscles to strengthen them and hopefully lead to better overall posture.
},
{
    559.96,563.52
     This exercise is what I'd like to call Dr. Rose Super Posture Bridge.
},
{
    563.52,568.56
     I'm going to take one of the best lower back and pelvic postural exercises, the glute
},
{
    568.56,572.66
     bridge, modify it, add a twist to it to focus on the full back.
},
{
    572.66,574.96
     You can do this one in bed or on the floor.
},
{
    574.96,579.4
     I would recommend rolling up a large bath towel for this one because it'll help open
},
{
    579.4,583.52
     up the chest a little bit more, making this exercise more efficient.
},
{
    583.52,584.82
     Let's start off on our back.
},
{
    584.82,589.24
     Let's position that towel to run lengthwise in between our shoulder blades and pretty
},
{
    589.24,592.28
     much run from the upper back to the middle back.
},
{
    592.28,594.16
     Just rest your head down like this.
},
{
    594.16,600.24
     In the first part, I want to identify weakness in the lower back to pretty much optimize
},
{
    600.24,601.56
     the pelvic bridge.
},
{
    601.56,604.8
     I'm going to bend my knees, keep my feet flat.
},
{
    604.8,605.16
     Let's start with
},
{
    605.16,609.72
     the heels pretty close to the back of the legs. Hands go right on the hips. The
},
{
    609.72,613.04
     pelvic bridge is very easy. We're just going to lift our hips, our pelvis up
},
{
    613.04,616.36
     towards the ceiling to achieve a nice straight line from the knees to the hips
},
{
    616.36,620.88
     to the shoulders. If you do have weakness and you're not able to go up all the way,
},
{
    620.88,625.04
     do the best you can. Over time, hopefully you'll build strength and be able to
},
{
    625.04,629.84
     get that nice straight line. You should feel an activation of the muscles into the back, the legs,
},
{
    629.84,635.28
     the hamstrings across the pelvis and hips, lower back, and also the stomach. You want to hold this
},
{
    635.28,640.48
     one for about five to ten seconds. From there, you're just going to relax. What we want to do
},
{
    640.48,645.66
     from there is just move our feet a little bit further away from us and repeat this exercise.
},
{
    645.66,651.2
     When you do this, you're going to notice that muscles get hit just a little bit differently.
},
{
    651.2,654.7
     This time around, I feel it more into the back, the legs, the hamstrings.
},
{
    654.7,658.74
     The further that I go away still, the more I'll start to feel it into the glute.
},
{
    658.74,661.04
     But go through different foot placements.
},
{
    661.04,663.74
     Let's say this one right here, I just struggled the most with.
},
{
    663.74,668.8
     I have the most amount of weakness with it. That's where we want to stop and throw more repetitions
},
{
    668.8,673.92
     in. You want to identify weaknesses, throw reps in, build strength because that can help
},
{
    673.92,680.64
     improve lower back and pelvic posture. How we're going to add the twist into this exercise
},
{
    680.64,684.92
     and take it to the next level to focus on the full back is we're going to incorporate
},
{
    684.92,686.28
     a little bit more movements,
},
{
    686.28,688.54
     dynamic movements to target the upper back.
},
{
    688.54,692.72
     So let's get back into our optimal bridge positioning.
},
{
    692.72,695.4
     And then what I'm going to do is straighten my arms like this,
},
{
    695.4,696.48
     straight at the elbow,
},
{
    696.48,698.82
     and then my palms are going to be facing down
},
{
    698.82,699.84
     towards the better of the floor,
},
{
    699.84,704.04
     and I'm going to slowly raise my arms up towards the ceiling,
},
{
    704.04,706.72
     and then away from me just like this.
},
{
    706.72,708.24
     So my palms are up towards the ceiling
},
{
    708.24,709.56
     in the final position.
},
{
    709.56,712.6
     Really try to take your elbows
},
{
    712.6,714.2
     in the backside of your hands right here
},
{
    714.2,715.56
     down towards the floor.
},
{
    715.56,717.48
     You should feel the chest starting to open up
},
{
    717.48,720.36
     and a lot firing into the upper back.
},
{
    720.36,723.2
     Hold this for about five to 10 seconds.
},
{
    723.2,729.5
     From there, you're just going to take a breather and then you're just going to simply repeat this up to ten to fifteen
},
{
    729.5,733.68
     times. With each repetition always challenge yourself to stretch more into
},
{
    733.68,738.06
     it to activate those muscles. If you want to take this one to even the next next
},
{
    738.06,741.94
     level let's get back into that bridge position but this time around I'm going
},
{
    741.94,745.12
     to do a floor angel. So I'm going to take my arms,
},
{
    745.12,749.12
     bend them at 90 degrees at the elbows like this, kind of like making a field goal position. We're
},
{
    749.12,754.16
     going to wing our elbows down as much as we can. Again, feel a very good stretch into the chest
},
{
    754.16,759.52
     and also pinch those shoulder blades over that towel. From there I'm just going to slowly
},
{
    759.52,766.48
     raise my arms overhead while keeping my elbows down until my hands can start to overlap and clap.
},
{
    766.48,771.04
     Hold this for about a second and then just slowly come back down from there.
},
{
    771.04,775.16
     Take a breather and then do this one for about 10 repetitions.
},
{
    775.16,780.16
     But go through all of these motions and progress into them until you can get to the floor angel
},
{
    780.16,785.46
     exercise and I really do hope that that gives you very quick posture improvement.
