     Welcome to Ossir and Pizio YouTube channel. Today we're going to be looking at the best

{
    4.56,7.6
     exercises to deal with acute lower back pain.
},
{
    14.32,19.6
     The first exercise for the acute lower back pain series are knees ways. This is a great
},
{
    19.6,24.56
     exercise if you're finding that you're struggling to move and the back is spasming. What you
},
{
    24.56,26.96
     want to do is lie on your back with a pillow underneath your neck,
},
{
    26.96,30.88
     bringing the knees up and gently allowing the feet to rest on the floor.
},
{
    30.88,35.12
     What we want to aim to do is gently let the knees sway side to side.
},
{
    35.12,39.84
     This is aiming at increasing range of motion and mobility into the lower spine,
},
{
    39.84,42.96
     softening through the postural muscles that have tightened up,
},
{
    42.96,49.92
     as well as allowing movement to be reintroduced into the lower spine. We want to aim
},
{
    49.92,55.68
     to do this between one to two minutes. The next exercise are knee hugs. The aim
},
{
    55.68,59.8
     of this exercise is to decompress through the lower spine. Due to the
},
{
    59.8,64.48
     cuteness of the lower back we want to bring up one leg at a time, gently
},
{
    64.48,65.44
     pulsing at end range for a couple of pulses and then relaxing the lower back, we want to bring up one leg at a time, gently pulsing at end
},
{
    65.44,71.4
     range for a couple of pulses and then relaxing the leg back down. What this is starting to
},
{
    71.4,75.72
     do is decompress and take a little bit of flexion into that lower spine as well as moving
},
{
    75.72,82.28
     through the pelvis. We're aiming to repeat this about 10-15 times on each side. Again
},
{
    82.28,85.6
     the range is determined by how it feels. If it's too much
},
{
    85.6,93.48
     bringing the leg up just reduce the range of motion.
},
{
    93.48,98.96
     The next exercise is looking at gentle side bending through the lower spine. The aim of
},
{
    98.96,105.28
     this is to gently allow the body to move side to side. What this is doing is taking the joints and the
},
{
    105.28,110.64
     discs into a side bending motion whilst fixing the core nice and tight and stretching up
},
{
    110.64,117.88
     through the body. We want to aim to do this gently each side for about a couple of minutes.
},
{
    117.88,122.84
     If it is tender or painful as you're moving through, you want to continue the movement
},
{
    122.84,125.92
     but you want to reduce the range.
},
{
    125.92,130.8
     Finally we're looking at getting comfortable. This is demonstrating a
},
{
    130.8,135.12
     really nice way to relax when resting with an acute spasm in the lower back.
},
{
    135.12,139.44
     You want to aim to be in sideline position with a pillow between the knees,
},
{
    139.44,148.0
     allowing the body to relax. Finally, walking is absolutely vital for a cute lower spine.
},
{
    148.24,152.68
     This increases movement and allows blood to get into the area to help with recovery.
