     Proper therapy exercises are important for recovery
},
{
    25.0,27.0
     from most orthopedic conditions.
},
{
    27.0,31.0
     I've designed this series to provide you with up-to-date therapy regimens
},
{
    31.0,34.0
     that you can access at home, in the gym, or on the road.

    34.0,38.0
     I hope you find these videos helpful, and best of luck in your recovery.

     Passive stretching can be done on the table. This is generally done when you have very little motion.
},
{
    54.18,57.52
     Use a towel under your hand.
},
{
    57.52,62.92
     Lean forward and gently slide the arm out until you feel a gentle stretch at the shoulder
},
{
    62.92,65.98
     and hold that position for 30 seconds.
},
{
    66.82,68.82
     Back off.
},
{
    70.64,74.1
     Same thing can be done with your shoulder directly facing the table,
},
{
    75.24,79.66
     allowing a stretch out to the side. Again, go to the stretched position.
},
{
    80.3,82.3
     Hold for 30 seconds.
},
{
    82.74,86.6
     Back off for 15 seconds and repeat.
},
{
    86.6,93.8
     After you've regained some motion up to shoulder level, you can perform a similar exercise against
},
{
    93.8,96.0
     the wall.
},
{
    96.0,102.88
     The opposite arm is used to push the arm up or the fingers can walk up the wall, keeping
},
{
    102.88,106.72
     your shoulders level without hiking of one shoulder.
},
{
    106.72,109.72
     Go to where you feel a stretch and hold.
},
{
    111.84,113.76
     At the end of the motion, you can bend your knees
},
{
    113.76,117.96
     and lean into the wall to get that last few degrees
},
{
    117.96,119.64
     of full elevation overhead.
},
{
    124.56,130.08
     Rotation stretching can be done against the pole or a wall or in a doorway.
},
{
    130.08,136.48
     You put your arm or hand up against the threshold, keep your elbow at your side, and rotate your
},
{
    136.48,150.26
     torso away until and feeling a stretch
},
{
    150.26,153.12
     in front of the shoulder.
},
{
    156.5,162.6
     You can also be done above shoulder level, rotating your body till you feel a
},
{
    162.6,168.0
     stretch in front of the shoulder and holding that position.
},
{
    172.0,180.0
     Stretch is done with the uninvolved arm, bringing the involved elbow across your body until you feel a stretch behind the shoulder.
},
{
    193.0,213.84
     The stick can be used.
},
{
    213.84,219.64
     The involved arm is the left arm in this case.
},
{
    219.64,225.84
     Opposite arm lifts overhead and brings that involved arm up into a nice stretch behind the back
},
{
    225.84,233.72
     and the position is held.
},
{
    233.72,256.48
     This generally gets the last few degrees of full internal rotation. Music
