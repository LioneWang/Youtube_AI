     Hey everybody, it's Doctor Jo and Bee Bremy and today I'm going to show you nine seated
},
{
    6.18,7.88
     exercises for the leg.
},
{
    7.88,10.4
     So let's get started.
},
{
    10.4,15.24
     Disclaimer alert, disclaimer alert.
},
{
    15.24,19.46
     So the first exercise seated is just going to be a heel-toe raise.
},
{
    19.46,22.72
     So this is really easy to do, especially if you're working out at a desk all day.
},
{
    22.72,28.08
     Most of these are easy to do and you can just kind of do them without thinking very much. But it's just like it sounds, you're going to
},
{
    28.08,33.04
     do heel raises and then toe raises. So the toes usually don't come up quite as much, but you're
},
{
    33.04,38.72
     just going to alternate back and forth. And I like this one because it kind of helps your calves work
},
{
    38.72,43.76
     like a natural pump just to help the blood flow and the circulation in your legs as well. So
},
{
    43.76,45.92
     this is a really nice one to do.
},
{
    45.92,49.8
     Then the next one is just going to be a hip flexion exercise.
},
{
    49.8,54.52
     And so really all you're doing is you're bringing your knee up towards the ceiling.
},
{
    54.52,56.36
     If you have a back rest, that's great.
},
{
    56.36,58.48
     Get your back nice and upright against the back rest.
},
{
    58.48,62.6
     But if you don't have anything, try not to lean when you bring your leg up.
},
{
    62.6,65.52
     Try and really just get that movement at your hip.
},
{
    65.52,72.42
     I like to alternate back and forth with these just because you want to work both sides and it's just a little bit easier for
},
{
    72.42,79.52
     me just to alternate back and forth. So again with these you can do 10 to 15, you know, maybe two sets at a time,
},
{
    80.46,82.26
     several times throughout the day.
},
{
    82.26,89.48
     And then the next one is going to be a long arc quad. And so really all that is is like a knee extension and so you're
},
{
    89.48,92.96
     really just working your quad muscles. So you know we're going all the way up
},
{
    92.96,96.64
     and down the leg. So with this one you're just going to kick your leg up and I
},
{
    96.64,101.44
     like when you come all the way up to pull your toes towards you really just to
},
{
    101.44,109.72
     squeeze that quad muscle at the end and then nice and slow back down. So you can alternate if you want to or with these if it's easier just
},
{
    109.72,115.24
     to do you know 10 to 15 on one side you can do that and then switch to the other
},
{
    115.24,120.4
     side. So same thing couple sets of those a couple times throughout the day. So then
},
{
    120.4,124.2
     the next one is going to be maybe what we would call something like a hip
},
{
    124.2,126.32
     abduction tap out.
},
{
    126.32,134.72
     So now you're kind of working these abductors, the outsides of your leg, and all you're just going to do is kind of bring your leg and tap it out to the side.
},
{
    134.72,140.72
     So again, you can alternate back and forth or you can just do them all at one time.
},
{
    140.72,149.02
     So I'm moving the whole leg for this one. There's some other exercises we're going to do rotation movements in a second. So really this one's moving the
},
{
    149.02,154.28
     whole leg. You are doing that abduction hip abduction movement. So that one
},
{
    154.28,157.62
     you're moving the whole leg, some of the others we won't be. But again you know
},
{
    157.62,162.62
     10 to 15 on each side just kind of getting everything moving. So this one is
},
{
    162.62,165.64
     going into rotation which would be an external
},
{
    165.64,169.52
     hip rotation and it's almost like if you're just going up to cross your leg
},
{
    169.52,173.44
     like into a figure four. So you're coming up this way but as you can see I'm
},
{
    173.44,178.0
     rotating my leg up so I'm not just picking it up and putting it like that.
},
{
    178.0,182.86
     I'm actually bringing the foot up almost like if I was just going to cross my
},
{
    182.86,189.4
     leg but I'm not going to do all of that. I'm trying to rotate my hip and that's an external hip rotation even
},
{
    189.4,194.88
     though my foot's coming inwards it's externally rotating my hip. So again you
},
{
    194.88,200.2
     know 10 to 15 make sure you're doing both sides for that. So then the next one
},
{
    200.2,207.36
     we're going to start using a resistive band. So if you haven't done resistive band
},
{
    207.36,212.56
     exercises before make sure you're using the lightest one because sometimes they feel easy
},
{
    212.56,216.88
     while you're doing them but then you get really sore afterwards. So this one we're going to go
},
{
    216.88,223.44
     back into the hip flexion exercise but this time we're using the band. Now the band is not only
},
{
    223.44,225.78
     giving you resistance going up, but
},
{
    225.78,230.26
     it's also going to try and pull your leg in while you're going. So you really want
},
{
    230.26,234.54
     to keep this leg up. You can see how I tried to pull my foot in. So you don't
},
{
    234.54,239.34
     want to do this. You don't want it coming in. You really want to keep it out that
},
{
    239.34,243.22
     same distance down at the bottom where your feet are and then when you're
},
{
    243.22,247.08
     bringing it up. So you're not only getting resistance this way, but you're getting that
},
{
    247.08,250.2
     resistance on the outside as well. So you might want to do a little less of
},
{
    250.2,253.76
     these. You might want to just do five or ten to start off with and then just kind
},
{
    253.76,258.2
     of see how it feels. So then you're going to bring the band up to your thighs.
},
{
    258.2,262.92
     And while I'm bringing it up, I'd like to give a shout out to my wall of thanks
},
{
    262.92,267.44
     folks. So FRD, Kathleen M, Dan, and
},
{
    267.44,271.28
     Eric P. Thank you so much for being on my wall of thanks and if you'd like to
},
{
    271.28,274.72
     find out how to be on that wall of thanks, make sure you click on the link in
},
{
    274.72,279.96
     the description below. So with this one, now the band or the loop band is going to
},
{
    279.96,284.0
     be above my knees, just kind of on my thighs, but right above the knees. So not
},
{
    284.0,289.82
     on the knees. And then this is almost just like what we would call maybe like a hip abduction
},
{
    289.82,294.16
     roll out. So you're getting some of the rotation of the rolling, but you're still
},
{
    294.16,299.56
     going out to the side with the band. So I would do more just kind of rolling out
},
{
    299.56,305.1
     like this now. And if you've seen some of my other exercises, this would be like a
},
{
    305.1,310.54
     hook line when I'm lying down doing like hip abduction and hook line, but
},
{
    310.54,314.66
     you're doing it seated in a chair. So again you're still working all these leg
},
{
    314.66,318.14
     muscles, but now you're using the band to get yourself a little bit more
},
{
    318.14,322.26
     resistance into it. And again if you haven't done this before, you probably
},
{
    322.26,328.88
     want to start off with just fire a 10 with the lightest band, then if you get to 20, 25 and it's easy then you can go up to a
},
{
    328.88,333.92
     higher resistive band. So now I'm gonna bring it back down to the feet and now
},
{
    333.92,338.92
     we're gonna do a hip internal rotation with a resistive band and this one is a
},
{
    338.92,342.72
     little bit tougher for people. The hip internal rotation is a little more
},
{
    342.72,348.36
     uncomfortable so just make sure you're ready to do this. But again now this is a rotation so I'm not doing
},
{
    348.36,353.4
     that abduction where I'm taking my whole hip out but I'm actually turning at my
},
{
    353.4,358.18
     knee where my foot's going out but the top part of my leg is really just
},
{
    358.18,362.84
     staying in one spot. So you can see here where I'm just kind of rolling it out and
},
{
    362.84,369.36
     coming back in. You can roll it out and tap and come back in which is a little easier or you can do like I'm
},
{
    369.36,373.16
     doing and leave your foot in the air and you're really gonna feel that in your
},
{
    373.16,377.76
     hips and your legs. So again I would just start off with a little bit see how it
},
{
    377.76,382.84
     feels and then kind of bump up from there. And so then the last one then we're
},
{
    382.84,388.64
     gonna go back into that external rotation of the hip, but with the band. So we're going to go back into that kind of figure four
},
{
    388.64,395.92
     motion, but now I have the band. So as I come up, I'm getting that resistance. So you don't have to
},
{
    395.92,401.6
     come up as high as me. But again, you're trying to get that rotation, that external rotation of the
},
{
    401.6,405.0
     hip. And this was the internal rotation just so you
},
{
    405.0,408.76
     kind of know even though your foot's going in the opposite direction your
},
{
    408.76,414.6
     hip's going that way into that external rotation. So again these are working
},
{
    414.6,419.36
     smaller muscles around the hip so when you're using those bands you really want
},
{
    419.36,422.84
     to start off light because you're gonna feel it and you just want to make sure
},
{
    422.84,427.62
     that you're not overdoing it the first couple times you do it. So there you have it those are
},
{
    427.62,431.2
