     Hi, my name is Julie Tongay Gordon, registered dietitian at the Ottawa Hospital Cancer Centre.

     In this video, we'll explore what you can do if you have lost your appetite, and you're
},
{
    12.7,18.52
     losing weight, or you're underweight and you need to achieve a healthy body weight.
},
{
    18.52,21.64
     Weight loss can occur for many reasons.
},
{
    21.64,25.76
     Sometimes your body requires more nutrients to heal. It's sometimes due to
},
{
    25.76,31.28
     side effects associated to the cancer or the treatment such as lack of appetite,
},
{
    31.28,39.44
     sore mouth, trouble swallowing, nausea or vomiting, maybe bowel issues such as
},
{
    39.44,47.04
     diarrhea or constipation. It is sometimes due to anxiety and distress. So let's get started.
},
{
    47.04,51.52
     The first recommendation is that you eat several small meals throughout your day.
},
{
    51.52,57.32
     Try eating your largest meal when you're most hungry. Sometimes going out for a
},
{
    57.32,68.08
     short walk before your meal can help improve your appetite. Try making your plate look more appetizing by adding tomato, herbs, or chives.
},
{
    69.2,76.72
     Eat foods that you tolerate and that you enjoy. Try drinking fluids half an hour to an hour before
},
{
    76.72,85.68
     your meals or after your meals in order to allow more room for nutritious meals. And of course, choose high energy, high protein foods, and
},
{
    85.68,92.72
     avoid fat-free, sugar-free, low-calorie, light foods. There are many ways to
},
{
    92.72,96.08
     increase the protein and caloric content of your plate, and I have a few
},
{
    96.08,101.4
     examples to show you. So you may want to drink more whole milk. Add skim milk
},
{
    101.4,109.6
     powder to your milk in order to make fortified milk by adding one cup of skim milk powder to four cups of milk. Skim milk powder can also be
},
{
    109.6,115.52
     added to most of your moist meals. Try adding more cheese in your meals or as a
},
{
    115.52,127.32
     snack or yogurt especially Greek yogurt which has a higher protein content. Fish, as well as seafood, poultry and meat.
},
{
    128.26,130.36
     Try having more legumes.
},
{
    130.36,134.0
     Legumes include dried peas, beans and lentils.
},
{
    134.9,139.78
     Have more eggs as a snack or as a meal.
},
{
    139.78,142.6
     You can have more nuts and seeds,
},
{
    142.6,146.4
     as well as peanut butter or nut butter and maybe some marinated
},
{
    146.4,152.84
     tofu. You can increase the caloric content of your plate by adding more cream or whipping
},
{
    152.84,161.68
     cream, maybe ice cream and including more butter or oil or maybe margarine in your cooking.
},
{
    161.68,167.14
     Some dried fruits and maybe some jam and sauces. In order to meet your
},
{
    167.14,170.8
     nutritional needs you may find it convenient to purchase some nutritional
},
{
    170.8,175.96
     supplements. They are a great source of nutrients including protein and energy.
},
{
    175.96,182.88
     They come in various forms some are ready to drink, pudding and others come in a
},
{
    182.88,188.38
     powdered form where you have to add your own milk. There are great options especially if
},
{
    188.38,189.64
     you're feeling unwell
},
{
    189.64,194.72
     or you need to maintain your weight or gain weight. You can also make your own
},
{
    194.72,197.32
     milkshake with ingredients that you have in your home.
},
{
    197.32,201.92
     Today we'll make peanut butter shake by adding one tablespoon of peanut butter,
},
{
    201.92,223.88
     one banana, and 1 half cup of purified milk.
},
{
    223.88,227.0
     Sometimes you may feel unwell or too tired to prepare a meal. In those times you may
},
{
    228.72,234.72
     want to try preparing foods in large batches when you do feel more energetic. Then freeze
},
{
    234.72,240.88
     the small portions for later when you are too tired to cook. Ask friends or family for
},
{
    240.88,246.48
     help in making some of your favorite meals. Or you may want to try a catering business
},
{
    246.48,252.6
     or home delivered food programs such as Meals on Wheels. Try eating out at your favorite
},
{
    252.6,259.4
     restaurant on occasion. Keep your kitchen well stocked with easy to prepare nutritious foods
},
{
    259.4,265.52
     that we have discussed earlier. This will ensure that you'll have the foods you need to make a healthy meal or
},
{
    265.52,272.16
     snack, especially when you're feeling under the weather. Remember, if your weight loss persists,
},
{
    272.72,278.0
     please discuss it with your physician, nurse, and radiation therapist. A referral to the
},
{
    278.0,284.48
     dietician may be recommended. I do encourage you to visit our website for more nutrition tips
