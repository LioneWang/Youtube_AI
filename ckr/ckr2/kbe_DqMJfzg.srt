{
    10.68,12.4
     Let's talk today about knee pain.
},
{
    12.4,17.44
     If you've been lifting for any length of time, likely you've had some sort of knee pain or
},
{
    17.44,20.44
     might have knee pain in the future if you're not doing the right things.
},
{
    20.44,23.6
     Guys, knee pain can debilitate your leg workouts.
},
{
    23.6,27.92
     I know I've suffered from it and I know what it can do to your legs when you're trying
},
{
    27.92,30.04
     to squat and especially squat heavy.
},
{
    30.04,33.28
     So what I want to do today is first of all cover a couple of the reasons what might be
},
{
    33.28,36.68
     causing your knee pain because that's going to be important to understand the difference
},
{
    36.68,40.68
     and then show you one that I think is really common especially for guys that train and
},
{
    40.68,41.68
     lift weights.
},
{
    41.68,45.44
     So if we look here we've got our boy Raymond and we've got our skeleton.
},
{
    45.44,50.28
     So what you'll see is that in the knee, we've got a lot of different sources of pain.
},
{
    50.28,55.44
     Now you guys have probably heard about ACL pain and MCL pain and LCL, right?
},
{
    55.44,58.88
     We're talking about tears really because those are ligaments that get injured during sports
},
{
    58.88,59.88
     most often.
},
{
    59.88,65.08
     Those are the ACL and PCL are inside the knee, the LCL and MCL are going to be on the inside
},
{
    65.08,67.52
     and outside of the knee.
},
{
    67.52,73.08
     And basically that's just one source of injury, but we've also got osteoarthritic changes
},
{
    73.08,77.6
     that can happen where you actually get degenerative changes on the bone, the bone and bone area
},
{
    77.6,83.64
     or on the underside of the patella here that grinds up against the femur.
},
{
    83.64,85.52
     We can talk about that in a second.
},
{
    85.52,87.2
     We also have meniscus issues.
},
{
    87.2,91.16
     If you guys talk about that, it's the cushion between the two bones here, the tibia and
},
{
    91.16,96.72
     the femur that gives us that space between the joint that can wear down or tear.
},
{
    96.72,101.76
     But I find that the most common injury that we get when we train our inflammatory conditions
},
{
    101.76,105.32
     from overuse of the patella tendon.
},
{
    105.32,108.32
     So patella tendon, this is what you're seeing right here, okay?
},
{
    108.32,114.76
     And what it does is it runs over the patella here, it holds it in place, and you can get
},
{
    114.76,119.8
     inflammation of this a lot of times causing patella femoral issues, we've heard that
},
{
    119.8,126.96
     before, and it impacts the tracking of the patella when your knee goes into flexion and
},
{
    126.96,127.96
     extension.
},
{
    127.96,133.8
     So, as we flex the knee and extend the knee, you want normal mechanics of the patella so
},
{
    133.8,136.8
     you get this glide and it glides right in this groove right here.
},
{
    136.8,140.92
     You can see that it's supposed to glide right in this groove, but what will happen is it
},
{
    140.92,143.2
     starts to get out of position.
},
{
    143.2,144.4
     Well guess what?
},
{
    144.4,147.18
     This isn't a knee issue. I talked about guess what? This isn't a knee issue. I've
},
{
    147.18,151.48
     talked about this before. This is not a knee issue. The knee is a train and this is its
},
{
    151.48,157.72
     track here and here. So guess what happens when the track gets twisted? The knee in
},
{
    157.72,162.42
     the train goes flying off the track. So when you start looking and focusing all your efforts
},
{
    162.42,168.4
     on the knee pain and trying to cure the patella femoral issues or trying to cure your patella tendinitis, and you're
},
{
    168.4,171.72
     not paying any attention to the track, you're way off track.
},
{
    171.72,175.64
     So, what you want to do is you want to start looking for the source and the cause of your
},
{
    175.64,180.52
     knee pain because most often, 99% of the time, the source of that is going to be somewhere
},
{
    180.52,181.52
     else.
},
{
    181.52,185.28
     And when we look at this, it's either going to be the track at the bottom, which
},
{
    185.28,189.52
     is going to be controlled by your ankle and foot, or the track at the top, which is going
},
{
    189.52,192.6
     to be controlled by the muscles in your head.
},
{
    192.6,197.48
     So if you look at what goes on here, if you're somebody that has flat feet, again, one of
},
{
    197.48,198.48
     my biggest issues.
},
{
    198.48,202.56
     If you have flat feet, your foot will collapse down and in, okay?
},
{
    202.56,209.88
     There's no arch, so the arch comes down and in. That takes the tibia here with it, into internal rotation. Well this stays
},
{
    209.88,215.52
     here, this gets twisted in, now you've got a twisted track. So now this thing
},
{
    215.52,221.48
     tries to move on this twisted track, you can see it's off the track already. It's
},
{
    221.48,227.2
     actually being pulled in, you can see. So it's off the track, that's not going to move smoothly as we do this.
},
{
    227.2,232.08
     And with every rep of your squat with a flat foot, that patella is banging up against
},
{
    232.08,233.32
     the side of the track.
},
{
    233.32,234.52
     Guess what happens?
},
{
    234.52,235.6
     Inflammation.
},
{
    235.6,238.58
     You can get inflammation on the underside of the patella, you can get inflammation up
},
{
    238.58,239.58
     through the tendon.
},
{
    239.58,241.6
     We have issues though, okay?
},
{
    241.6,246.12
     So now, up at the hip, more common, because you can fix this, you can use an orthotic
},
{
    246.12,251.48
     down here to try to boost up your arch so you can sort of fix the mechanics and reestablish
},
{
    251.48,252.84
     your straight track.
},
{
    252.84,255.44
     But up here guys, this is the big issue.
},
{
    255.44,257.84
     Most guys have weak underdeveloped hips.
},
{
    257.84,260.12
     We talked about that a lot too.
},
{
    260.12,264.76
     If your hip is underdeveloped and it can't control the internal or external rotation
},
{
    264.76,267.32
     here of your femur, the same thing is going to happen.
},
{
    267.32,272.2
     This can be all online, but if this gets pulled down and in, you've got an issue.
},
{
    272.2,277.76
     If this gets pulled out too much because of tightness into your hip, you've got an issue.
},
{
    277.76,282.64
     But again, I find the biggest issue here is glute medius weakness, and that's something
},
{
    282.64,284.36
     that we could actually address too.
},
{
    284.36,288.48
     So I wanted to show you one of the ways that you can address that and even test yourself
},
{
    288.48,289.48
     and see.
},
{
    289.48,292.6
     The easiest test and I know it's going to sound embarrassing, especially coming from
},
{
    292.6,297.72
     a strength coach, but lay on your side and do the Jane Fonda leg raise up and down to
},
{
    297.72,298.72
     the side.
},
{
    298.72,300.44
     Do about 50 of them.
},
{
    300.44,305.88
     Do 50 of them and let me know in this video below if it burns like hell because I guarantee
},
{
    305.88,311.68
     if you have weak glute medias you're going to feel a real burn that might feel pretty
},
{
    311.68,316.56
     damn intense and you might be squatting 350-400 pounds it might still feel like it really
},
{
    316.56,317.56
     burns.
},
{
    317.56,319.96
     So if that happens to you you've got to get that stronger.
},
{
    319.96,325.6
     So one of the ways that we do that is with a glute medius hip bump. And it's really pretty simple.
},
{
    325.6,330.32
     What you're trying to do is you're trying to allow your body to drop.
},
{
    330.32,335.52
     In PET we call this the tremdellum beryxiae, where it just drops down to the side.
},
{
    335.52,339.6
     Because you're letting go of the muscles over here that keep you upright.
},
{
    339.6,344.2
     So here, in order to get it back, we have to contract our glute medius, which is going
},
{
    344.2,345.12
     to pull our pelvis back and have to contract our glute medius which is going to pull our
},
{
    345.12,348.16
     pelvis back and over to the side over here.
},
{
    348.16,353.68
     So what we're doing is we're doing a closed chain hip abduction.
},
{
    353.68,357.18
     We know hip abduction if we're looking at the right leg is just lifting our leg out
},
{
    357.18,358.68
     to the side like that.
},
{
    358.68,363.64
     If we were to try to do that in a closed chain with our foot connected to the ground this
},
{
    363.64,364.64
     is what it would look like.
},
{
    364.64,369.16
     I'm basically letting the leg go further away from my midline as I raise my midline to
},
{
    369.16,370.16
     the right.
},
{
    370.16,374.76
     So just after doing this a little bit, I can really feel a burn in that left side glute
},
{
    374.76,375.76
     medius.
},
{
    375.76,377.16
     Maybe it's not enough for you.
},
{
    377.16,383.56
     All you got to do is attach a band, get inside of it, and here put it around your hips.
},
{
    383.56,384.72
     Do the same thing.
},
{
    384.72,385.68
     Get up on your left leg.
},
{
    385.68,392.36
     If you're trying to work the left hip, you get up on the left leg and you face the hip
},
{
    392.36,397.0
     that you're working inside towards the source of the band, the point of attachment.
},
{
    397.0,398.28
     You let yourself drop.
},
{
    398.28,399.28
     Just get really lazy.
},
{
    399.28,400.76
     Let your hips drop.
},
{
    400.76,404.24
     From here, you squeeze it straight over to the side.
},
{
    404.24,405.6
     Let it drop. Squeeze your hips straight to the side. Let it drop.
},
{
    405.6,407.32
     Squeeze your hips straight over the side.
},
{
    407.32,408.32
     This is not an ankle move.
},
{
    408.32,409.84
     This is not a knee move.
},
{
    409.84,410.84
     This is a hip move.
},
{
    410.84,412.64
     All your focus should be right here.
},
{
    412.64,413.8
     Let it drop.
},
{
    413.8,414.8
     Squeeze your hip.
},
{
    414.8,415.8
     Lateral.
},
{
    415.8,416.8
     Straight over to the side.
},
{
    416.8,418.92
     Hold it for a second and then come down.
},
{
    418.92,425.32
     I can already again feel this burning and obviously working a weak area.
},
{
    425.32,430.1
     We had some top major league athletes that had extremely weak hips and you would be surprised
},
{
    430.1,432.3
     because they were strong everywhere else.
},
{
    432.3,436.76
     This can cause knee pain, this can cause chronic knee pain, inflammation and everything else
},
{
    436.76,438.04
     that it is you're feeling.
},
{
    438.04,442.1
     So just because it's small and it seems like kind of a girly exercise, it doesn't mean
},
{
    442.1,445.38
     that it's not worthwhile and something you should do.
},
{
    445.38,446.86
     So guys, again, knee pain.
},
{
    446.86,448.5
     There are take home messages here.
},
{
    448.5,450.46
     There's a lot of different kinds of knee pain.
},
{
    450.46,454.74
     As a trainer, I see guys working out a lot of times, they're dealing with a lot of the
},
{
    454.74,459.06
     chronic inflammatory conditions, mostly of the tendons, the patellar tendon, namely.
},
{
    459.06,461.34
     You can fix it, but you've got to look other places.
},
{
    461.34,462.5
     You can't look right at the knee.
},
{
    462.5,463.5
     You've got to look up and down.
},
{
    463.5,466.96
     Down at your ankle, up at your hip, find out what the cause is.
},
{
    466.96,471.48
     If it persists and you are training with much more than knee pain, it might be time guys
},
{
    471.48,475.0
     that you have to start looking into other solutions.
},
{
    475.0,478.4
     We've created the ATHLEAN Mechanics Joint Supplement for that very reason.
},
{
    478.4,480.48
     I realize how many guys train in pain.
},
{
    480.48,485.8
     Every time I put up one of these videos, there's 50 other requests for shoulders, elbows, wrists,
},
{
    485.8,486.8
     neck.
},
{
    486.8,488.32
     People are dealing with pain.
},
{
    488.32,490.48
     We can fix that, but you've got to look in the right places.
},
{
    490.48,496.08
     And if you have to, guys, you can take, again, find ATHLEANRX, Mechanics over at ATHLEANRX.com.

{
    496.08,500.0
     Meantime, if you found this helpful, leave a thumbs up below and a comment.
},
{
    500.0,502.96
     Again, I'll make more of these videos as you demand them.
},
{
    502.96,504.48
     So just let me know what it is you want to see.
},
{
    504.48,506.6
     All right, guys. I'll see you guys back here again soon.
