     In this video I'm going to show at-home spinal decompression stretches that can give relief for

    4.88,9.44
     bulging discs and pinched nerves in the neck. Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe here at Spine Care in
},
{
    9.44,14.56
     St. Joseph, Michigan. When it comes to cervical discs, those shock absorbers in the neck,
},
{
    14.56,20.08
     it's all about pressure. The discs are built to withstand a lot of compression or up and down
},
{
    20.08,29.12
     forces throughout the day. However, just like a shock absorber on a car, it can be overwhelmed through hard impacts, think a heart fall or an accident and a sports
},
{
    29.12,33.6
     injury, and over time gradually start to break down through repetitive wear and
},
{
    33.6,37.54
     tear. Once the disc become damaged, they tend to bulge or herniate since they
},
{
    37.54,41.84
     cannot contain normal compressive forces. The result of this is an outpouching
},
{
    41.84,45.32
     disc or herniation that will make contact with a
},
{
    45.32,47.06
     nearby spinal nerve.
},
{
    47.06,49.68
     This is the classic cause of a pinched nerve.
},
{
    49.68,54.76
     So to unpinch the nerve, we need to reduce the pressure in the disc or simply decompress
},
{
    54.76,55.76
     the disc.
},
{
    55.76,59.54
     And we're going to do that through pulling or traction based stretches.
},
{
    59.54,63.04
     Why is traction the route to go to for a pinched nerve in the neck?
},
{
    63.04,65.36
     You can imagine if there's a lot of downward force
},
{
    65.36,67.64
     being put on the disc causing compression,
},
{
    67.64,70.56
     it's going to pancake the disc and bulge it out.
},
{
    70.56,72.8
     If we do the opposite by pulling on it,
},
{
    72.8,75.0
     it's going to relieve the pressure within the disc
},
{
    75.0,77.96
     and cause bulging material to come back in,
},
{
    77.96,79.88
     taking the bulge off the nerve.
},
{
    79.88,81.52
     You take the bulge off the nerve,
},
{
    81.52,84.12
     it will start to heal and you'll feel a lot less pain.
},
{
    84.12,88.24
     The main thing that we're going to look for while doing these stretches is less frequent
},
{
    88.24,93.8
     and intense symptoms, but more importantly what we call centralization.
},
{
    93.8,97.14
     Centralization is a fancy way of saying when you put pressure on a nerve, it will cause
},
{
    97.14,101.8
     it to travel, such as a sharp shooting pain into the shoulder or arms.
},
{
    101.8,105.12
     When you take the pressure off the nerve, the pain starts to move back up to
},
{
    105.12,110.88
     the starting point which would be in the neck. So this is important to remember. Nerve pain heals
},
{
    110.88,116.24
     by slowly moving back towards the starting point. After doing these stretches, if you're feeling
},
{
    116.24,121.68
     less pain and the pain isn't traveling as far, then they are working for you. So let's get started
},
{
    121.68,128.62
     with them and get feeling better right now. So the first decompression stretch that we're going to do is very straightforward.
},
{
    128.62,132.72
     You're going to take your thumbs right here and place them at the back of the
},
{
    132.72,136.98
     head or the base of the skull. If you feel off to the side you should feel two
},
{
    136.98,140.7
     large bumps off to the side of your head. That's the spot where you're going to
},
{
    140.7,145.12
     want to put the thumbs at. So I'm going to find those two spots right there,
},
{
    145.12,150.48
     take my thumbs, place them at the base of the skull right here, and then lock my knuckles.
},
{
    150.48,156.48
     The next part is going to be the traction. We're going to lift up on those two spots. So just like
},
{
    156.48,165.88
     this. And then I'm going to lift up until I feel a very good stretch right in the neck. You can also tilt the chin
},
{
    165.88,170.8
     towards the chest to get a little bit of a better angle on it while you lift up
},
{
    170.8,175.44
     and create that traction. The goal is to hold it for about a half minute, 30
},
{
    175.44,180.36
     seconds, relax, and then repeat it three to five times. If you can do this stretch
},
{
    180.36,184.48
     as needed throughout the day as long as you're finding relief with it. So another
},
{
    184.48,188.96
     way to be able to do this stretch is just using a normal hand towel.
},
{
    188.96,191.9
     And I like to fold it up just like that.
},
{
    191.9,196.64
     You're going to place this again at the base of the skull right at those two spots where
},
{
    196.64,198.16
     you feel those bumps.
},
{
    198.16,201.52
     You're going to grab the ends of the towel with your hands right here and then start
},
{
    201.52,205.0
     to lift up to get that traction.
},
{
    205.0,208.4
     Again with this one, I like to hold it for about 30 seconds,
},
{
    208.4,212.08
     relax, and then do it upwards to three to five times.
},
{
    212.08,214.6
     A lot of times with disc bulges in the neck,
},
{
    214.6,216.68
     you're going to get a one-sided arm pain.
},
{
    216.68,218.44
     That's generally from the spot
},
{
    218.44,220.72
     where that bulge is going off towards.
},
{
    220.72,223.6
     So what you can do with this stretch is modify it
},
{
    223.6,227.68
     to the point where you're going to get a lot of relief from a bulging disc that's causing it to go
},
{
    227.68,232.92
     down into the armor hands. So to do that pull up on it and then on one side just
},
{
    232.92,237.96
     pull a little bit more almost kind of like a side tilt with your head and you
},
{
    237.96,242.6
     can do this right here to the point where it starts to help relieve that bulge
},
{
    242.6,248.6
     and gives that pain relief. Give it a try see if it works for you. If your pain is still lingering or getting
},
{
    248.6,252.96
     worse, more sophisticated traction is going to be needed to get relief. Look
},
{
    252.96,257.52
     into spinal decompression therapy, which is one of the best conservative options
},
{
    257.52,262.2
     available that can help treat herniated discs and pinched nerves. I use spinal
},
{
    262.2,265.68
     decompression therapy in my office and have gotten great results with
},
{
    265.68,271.44
     it and have helped a lot of people get long-lasting relief without the use of drugs, injections,
},
{
    271.44,275.92
     and surgery. So I hope these stretches helped you out and you're already getting some relief.
