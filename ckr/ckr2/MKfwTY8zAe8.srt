     Hello everybody, Craig here, Dr. of Physical Therapy from the Prehab Guys.
},
{
    3.96,8.0
     Today, we're going to be talking all things Turkish Getup.
},
{
    11.2,16.6
     First things first, like I said, let's make sure that the Turkish Getup is something safe for you.
},
{
    16.6,22.5
     Because if it's not safe for you, if you're going to expose different body areas, what's the point of even doing it?
},
{
    23.0,27.92
     So number one, do you have good shoulder range of motion?
},
{
    27.92,33.16
     What I mean by that is, can you even get your arms all the way up overhead?
},
{
    33.16,37.24
     If you can't get your arms up all the way overhead, you're here and you're going to
},
{
    37.24,39.12
     be holding a kettlebell.
},
{
    39.12,43.4
     You're just going to be exposing a lot of stress to your shoulder, potentially setting
},
{
    43.4,45.62
     you up for an overuse injury.
},
{
    45.62,46.92
     So that's number one, shoulder.
},
{
    46.92,49.28
     Let's actually, I'm gonna go to the wall in a little bit
},
{
    49.28,51.04
     to show you another way to measure your shoulder range
},
{
    51.04,53.94
     of motion, but let's stay here for a moment.
},
{
    53.94,57.94
     Number two, how well can your trunk and your hips move?
},
{
    57.94,60.64
     What I mean by that is at one point,
},
{
    60.64,63.56
     we have to get into this windmill position.
},
{
    63.56,65.0
     However, I'm not getting into that position
},
{
    65.0,67.0
     by just bending my back.
},
{
    67.0,70.0
     I am moving through my hip joint,
},
{
    70.0,73.0
     keeping my back as straight as I can
},
{
    73.0,77.0
     and rotating to get into this position.
},
{
    77.0,80.0
     So we want to look at that on both sides
},
{
    80.0,82.0
     because it's pretty important to make sure
},
{
    82.0,84.0
     that you can move through your hip
},
{
    84.0,89.0
     so that we're not putting excess stress on our low back and our mid back. So that's
},
{
    89.0,94.88
     number two. Number three, can you even put weight through your wrist? So just put
},
{
    94.88,99.72
     your hands down on the ground. Can you shift your weight back and forth loading
},
{
    99.72,104.08
     through your wrist? Even maybe do some of these circles. You're gonna be holding
},
{
    104.08,105.1
     a weight in your
},
{
    105.1,107.12
     hand the entire time.
},
{
    107.12,108.6
     You need to have good grip strength.
},
{
    108.6,112.92
     You need to have the tolerance to holding weight in your wrist.
},
{
    112.92,116.96
     If you can't even do those things, maybe there's some other things that we need to address
},
{
    116.96,119.6
     before jumping into a get-up.
},
{
    119.6,121.0
     Those are three things, right?
},
{
    121.0,122.0
     Shoulder range of motion.
},
{
    122.0,124.12
     We're going to head to the wall in a bit.
},
{
    124.12,129.56
     How well can you move at your hips and your trunk and what shape are your wrists in last but not
},
{
    129.56,134.6
     least ready I'm going to do some lunges so you notice that at one point you got to get
},
{
    134.6,140.84
     into this lunge position you got to have your arm up overhead stand tall and then come back
},
{
    140.84,145.58
     down can you even do this balanced with no weight?
},
{
    151.12,151.46
     All right, so we want to make sure that this looks good that this looks clean and you're not compensating
},
{
    154.98,155.32
     Because if you don't have good form and good stability in the rest of your body
},
{
    160.62,160.74
     You're gonna have to make up for it with your shoulder and this is how people put too much stress on their shoulder
},
{
    162.82,165.16
     All right, so make sure that you can do lunges as well. All right, let's head over to the wall
},
{
    165.16,167.48
     because I want to show this other cleaner
},
{
    167.48,170.0
     shoulder range of motion test.
},
{
    170.0,172.12
     Bring your feet away from the wall,
},
{
    172.12,175.0
     get your low back and the rest of your back
},
{
    175.0,176.84
     flat against the wall.
},
{
    176.84,180.0
     Now while trying to keep your elbow straight,
},
{
    180.0,181.92
     try to get your thumbs to the wall.
},
{
    181.92,185.66
     So I'm making sure that I'm keeping my elbow straight and I'm trying to get my thumbs to the wall. So, I'm making sure that I'm keeping my elbow straight
},
{
    185.66,188.12
     and I'm trying to get my thumbs to the wall.
},
{
    189.12,190.96
     Are you arching in the back?
},
{
    190.96,193.06
     Are your elbows bending?
},
{
    193.06,194.72
     These are all things to be mindful of
},
{
    194.72,196.22
     and to take a look at,
},
{
    196.22,199.18
     but we wanna make sure that we can get into this position
},
{
    199.18,202.2
     while keeping our back relatively flat against the wall.
},
{
    202.2,204.2
     Or else we're just gonna be compensating
},
{
    204.2,205.72
     at different areas in our body
},
{
    205.72,207.4
     when we're trying to do the get up,
},
{
    207.4,211.12
     especially doing the lunge movement with the get up.
},
{
    211.12,214.64
     All right, so now let's transition into
},
{
    214.64,217.0
     how to get your first Turkish get up.
},
{
    217.0,218.0
     All right, so this is how you should
},
{
    218.0,219.32
     get your first Turkish get up.
},
{
    219.32,221.56
     So now with the weight, it's with the shoe.
},
{
    221.56,223.64
     Let's come over here, I wanna demonstrate.
},
{
    224.88,225.12
     So if you can't master doing the Turkish get up Let's look at the shoe. Let's come over here. I want to demonstrate.
},
{
    225.12,231.2
     So if you can't master doing the Turkish Get Up by balancing a shoe, then you definitely
},
{
    231.2,233.04
     shouldn't be doing it with weight.
},
{
    233.04,237.6
     So get a shoe, balance it on your fist, and then go through the Get Up.
},
{
    237.6,240.98
     So the first part is we just need to get into the first position.
},
{
    240.98,246.12
     If I'm holding the shoe in my left hand, I want to balance right over my shoulder.
},
{
    246.12,251.12
     Now with my right leg and my right arm, I'm thinking give or take maybe 30 degrees or
},
{
    251.12,252.96
     so out to the side.
},
{
    252.96,257.76
     You can go a little bit wider or more narrow if you want, but I think 30 degrees is the
},
{
    257.76,258.76
     right way.
},
{
    258.76,263.48
     Now, I'm going to push through my left leg, pushing through my right arm, pushing through
},
{
    263.48,267.12
     my right heel. I'm pushing into the ground
},
{
    267.12,274.8
     and punching up to the ceiling. This is step one. This is the beginning of the roll. Now from here,
},
{
    274.8,281.44
     I need to really push through my left foot, push through my right elbow to get my chest high. I'm
},
{
    281.44,287.4
     still rolling and punching. Now, step two, we need to do this arm transition.
},
{
    287.4,291.96
     So I need to get off my elbow and get my right arm straight.
},
{
    291.96,295.64
     Now, in this position, we're going to do the next step.
},
{
    295.64,297.84
     We're going to lift up and bridge.
},
{
    297.84,301.26
     Okay, so we're holding this position for a split second.
},
{
    301.26,305.0
     Now the next step is we're going to sweep the leg.
},
{
    305.0,306.96
     This is all a little bit slow motion, okay?
},
{
    306.96,309.3
     But now we're sweeping the leg.
},
{
    309.3,312.64
     When I take a look down, my right knee
},
{
    312.64,315.32
     should be close to my right hand.
},
{
    315.32,318.24
     The shoe is balanced right over my shoulder.
},
{
    318.24,321.16
     The more that the shoe is balanced over my shoulder,
},
{
    321.16,323.92
     the less hard that my shoulder has to work, okay?
},
{
    323.92,324.94
     If this is anywhere else,
},
{
    324.94,327.2
     my shoulder's gonna have to work a little bit harder.
},
{
    327.2,332.16
     Just to get an appreciation for this, I'm moving through my hip right, I have my
},
{
    332.16,337.8
     shoe balanced over my shoulder, my trunk is relatively straight, I'm not really bent
},
{
    337.8,342.64
     or contorted. I'm rotating through my upper body. Now we need to transition
},
{
    342.64,345.52
     into this half-kneeling lunge position. I can rotate my leg a little body. Now we need to transition into this half-kneeling lunge position.
},
{
    345.52,351.36
     I can rotate my leg a little bit. Now from here, the next step, we're going to
},
{
    351.36,357.64
     stand tall. Okay, now we are standing tall here. I would have rotated my foot a
},
{
    357.64,361.64
     little bit more, but the turf didn't feel great on my knee. But you want to
},
{
    361.64,369.08
     rotate that to ideally get into a good lunge position. Now you're just going to reverse everything that you just did. So now
},
{
    369.08,373.92
     come into a reverse lunge. Again this shoe is still balanced over my shoulder.
},
{
    373.92,378.92
     Now I'm going to turn this foot a little bit without destroying my knee on this
},
{
    378.92,384.32
     rough turf and now the next step I'm going to do this windmill. So take a look.
},
{
    384.32,386.0
     I'm going to do it a few times.
},
{
    386.0,388.0
     Hopefully I can balance the shoe.
},
{
    388.0,395.0
     What I'm doing is with my right hand, I'm going to place it outside my right knee.
},
{
    395.0,400.0
     As I do that, I'm pushing my hips this way.
},
{
    400.0,401.0
     Take a look here.
},
{
    401.0,403.0
     Push my hips this way.
},
{
    403.0,404.0
     Rotate my body.
},
{
    404.0,406.36
     Get my right hand down there.
},
{
    406.36,412.26
     I feel a stretch in my left glute and again this shoulder, I mean the shill is positioned
},
{
    412.26,414.06
     right over my shoulder.
},
{
    414.06,420.06
     So now I need to get strong through my right arm and then we're going to transition.
},
{
    420.06,425.68
     Shoot that leg back out, stay really strong through my left foot on my right shoulder, and then come back
},
{
    425.68,431.28
     down to this position. So I'm not, I'm being mindful of my right shoulder. Take a look here.
},
{
    431.28,436.08
     You can even zoom in a little bit, but I don't want this shoulder rotated forward here. I need to
},
{
    436.08,441.84
     stay strong through my shoulder blade. You can readjust your arm position if you need to,
},
{
    441.84,450.7
     but think with this right hand, I'm like screwing it into the ground, screwing it into the ground, locking in my lat and my
},
{
    450.7,456.02
     shoulder blade and that feels a lot more comfortable on my shoulder. Now I am
},
{
    456.02,462.3
     going to do the next step where I transition back to my elbow and my
},
{
    462.3,466.04
     forearm. So this looks familiar right? If I look down,
},
{
    466.04,472.36
     okay, relatively 30 degrees or so, give or take. This shoe is still balanced over
},
{
    472.36,475.48
     my shoulder. I can't believe it. My shoulders even getting a little bit of a
},
{
    475.48,480.32
     workout here. So you can take a look from this position. I'm not sagging into my
},
{
    480.32,486.36
     shoulder. I'm staying strong through my shoulder blade, punching this towards the ceiling.
},
{
    486.36,490.68
     So I'm feeling these muscles here working to keep that
},
{
    490.68,493.4
     as well as staying strong through my right shoulder blade.
},
{
    493.4,498.4
     And now extend that right arm, reverse the roll,
},
{
    498.48,500.3
     and come back to starting position.
},
{
    501.54,503.8
     And now I can finally relax.
},
{
    503.8,505.4
     All right, now that you've mastered how to do
},
{
    505.4,507.52
     a Turkish Getup with just the shoe,
},
{
    507.52,508.6
     what if you went to the weight
},
{
    508.6,510.52
     and you're having a lot of difficulty with it?
},
{
    510.52,512.58
     We're gonna cover some of the common faults
},
{
    512.58,515.12
     and some of the common issues with the Turkish Getup.
},
{
    515.12,517.36
     And I'm gonna give you a few exercises
},
{
    517.36,518.4
     that you can start doing
},
{
    518.4,520.68
     that's gonna improve your Turkish Getup performance.
},
{
    520.68,524.62
     So number one is just wrist position holding a kettlebell.
},
{
    524.62,527.92
     You gotta do this right, especially as the weight gets heavier.
},
{
    527.92,530.08
     You're going to have a really hard time with this.
},
{
    530.08,532.96
     If you don't cradle a kettlebell good,
},
{
    532.96,536.44
     and then lay flat on your back and press up.
},
{
    536.44,539.92
     My knuckles need to be facing the ceiling the entire time.
},
{
    539.92,542.96
     What I see is people let their wrists extend,
},
{
    542.96,545.16
     their palm faces the ceiling, they're
},
{
    545.16,549.56
     stretching and compressing everything in the front of the wrist. Your wrist is
},
{
    549.56,554.76
     going to hurt if you do that long enough with heavy weight. Also, I'll see elbows
},
{
    554.76,559.92
     bend. So you need to stay strong through your shoulder blade, lock in that shoulder
},
{
    559.92,565.5
     blade, get your lats activated, squeeze the crap out of that handle, and keep your elbow
},
{
    565.5,566.5
     straight.
},
{
    566.5,567.74
     So that's number one.
},
{
    567.74,570.26
     Number two is the roll.
},
{
    570.26,575.28
     People will have a hard time getting into this rolling position.
},
{
    575.28,578.9
     So what you can do is just practice the roll, right?
},
{
    578.9,586.0
     So you can be here, push down through this left leg, push down through this right leg, keep your quads squeezed,
},
{
    586.0,590.6
     and push down through this right arm, and then roll.
},
{
    590.6,592.8
     You can just practice that.
},
{
    592.8,596.8
     If that's getting good and getting better, and we're rolling, right?
},
{
    596.8,600.8
     So I'm not trying to crunch like I'm doing the ab workout.
},
{
    600.8,602.8
     I am rolling.
},
{
    602.8,604.5
     So practice that roll.
},
{
    604.5,608.16
     Once that gets good, then you can practice to this.
},
{
    608.16,610.32
     Come down, come back up.
},
{
    610.32,615.32
     Roll, get on up, come back down.
},
{
    615.8,617.84
     If that's giving you too much trouble,
},
{
    617.84,622.36
     you can just be here and now you can roll this way.
},
{
    622.36,624.48
     So keep both knees bent.
},
{
    624.48,625.4
     So this we're just getting
},
{
    625.4,630.72
     comfortable with rolling and we're getting comfortable with our shoulder
},
{
    630.72,635.9
     being stabilized and working in this position because not only does our shoulder
},
{
    635.9,639.56
     have to work with the kettlebell right over it, but the Turkish get up a lot we
},
{
    639.56,645.0
     get sideways. So this is like a rolling arm bar with the kettlebell.
},
{
    646.52,648.42
     I really like these ones.
},
{
    648.42,651.26
     You can even take it a step further where you go here,
},
{
    651.26,653.12
     go up on the forearm.
},
{
    653.12,655.72
     You can get pretty creative with this stuff.
},
{
    655.72,660.04
     All right, so rolling and wrist position are two.
},
{
    660.04,664.32
     Now, what if you're having trouble with this leg sweep
},
{
    664.32,668.3
     where we get here, I'll demonstrate without the kettlebell,
},
{
    668.3,670.64
     but we're here, boom, boom, okay.
},
{
    670.64,673.68
     Now, what about the bridge?
},
{
    673.68,675.4
     Where I'm here, okay.
},
{
    675.4,680.4
     So, how do I get from here to boom, this leg sweep?
},
{
    681.0,683.56
     So, just exactly practice that.
},
{
    683.56,686.88
     You can do it with the weight. You can do it with a
},
{
    686.88,694.48
     shoe, but I'll demonstrate it here. Let's get here. Position up. Okay. Bridge up.
},
{
    694.48,699.08
     Strong through my right arm. Strong through my left hip. Strong through my right leg.
},
{
    699.08,713.22
     Lower back down. When I lower back down, I'm being mindful of that right shoulder, right? So keep it back, keep it pinned down, bridge up, bridge up. So that's one thing. Now,
},
{
    713.22,720.42
     if you just need to work on the leg sweep, just get here, practice this. Be here, okay,
},
{
    720.42,728.04
     that was good. Come back down. Sometimes I think we're always so focused on the kettlebell as we should be
},
{
    728.56,733.82
     But this is a really nice way to practice this drill and make sure that you're getting your knee
},
{
    734.32,740.44
     In the spot that it needs to be in so it should be behind your hand. Maybe a little bit inside
},
{
    741.36,743.36
     closer towards my other leg
},
{
    743.48,744.8
     all right
},
{
    744.8,747.88
     what about coming down?
},
{
    747.88,751.76
     So, say that you're having a hard time with this.
},
{
    751.76,752.8
     Let's go to this.
},
{
    752.8,754.56
     So these are windmills, right?
},
{
    754.56,755.48
     So ready?
},
{
    755.48,759.6
     Let's have the camera get my entire body in this view.
},
{
    759.6,761.28
     You're gonna be here.
},
{
    761.28,764.96
     If I'm holding the kettlebell, left leg is forward.
},
{
    764.96,765.64
     And now I'm just gonna kettlebell, left leg is forward, and now I'm just going to
},
{
    765.64,775.72
     windmill. Come down, come back up. Come down, come back up. So with this, I'm
},
{
    775.72,780.28
     moving through my hip, I'm getting strong in this position. Now I'm staying
},
{
    780.28,788.12
     rooted in all points of contact with the ground, but then I'm punching up
},
{
    788.12,789.12
     towards the ceiling.
},
{
    789.12,795.32
     What I mean by that is I'm here and then it's a boom, punch up and get balanced.
},
{
    795.32,799.72
     Boom, punch up and get balanced.
},
{
    799.72,805.0
     That's a really good shoulder stability part task exercise of the get up.
},
{
    806.32,807.32
     Last but not least,
},
{
    808.24,811.12
     if you're having trouble with the lunge,
},
{
    811.92,815.92
     just practice lunges with an overhead kettlebell press.
},
{
    816.76,819.88
     So it's here, stand up, come down,
},
{
    821.16,822.0
     stand up,
},
{
    824.56,827.96
     down, stand up the entire time.
},
{
    827.96,831.92
     Keeping this kettlebell positioned right over my shoulder.
},
{
    831.92,838.52
     I don't want to see anything where you come down, your arms lowers, you're moving around.
},
{
    838.52,843.2
     Like I said earlier, you were going to stress your shoulder.
},
{
    843.2,848.16
     The more that you have to make up for balancing the kettlebell, if your lower body isn't balanced.
},
{
    848.16,852.48
     All right, those are great tips to get going with the get up.
},
{
    852.48,853.48
     Try them out.
