     Friends, leg pain is a common problem but do you know many studies and researches have
},
{
    33.76,40.16
     proven that if you do regular warm up and cool down exercises you can prevent your leg
},
{
    40.16,45.56
     pain to a lot of extent and a very core part of cool down and warm up exercises are
},
{
    45.56,51.56
     stretching exercises or stretches of the muscle. And when it comes to leg muscles, there are
},
{
    51.56,57.32
     three important muscles that need to be stretched over and over again in order to maintain good
},
{
    57.32,62.8
     flexibility and prevent injury. Quadricep muscles also called as front thigh muscle.
},
{
    62.8,68.14
     Humstring muscle also called as your back thigh muscle and your calf muscle.
},
{
    68.14,73.82
     These three muscles are always at higher risk of developing tightness and this tightness
},
{
    73.82,78.98
     leads to abnormal movement patterns or is limited mobility in the muscles and when you
},
{
    78.98,84.74
     try to do some activity at that time this limited mobility can lead to further injury
},
{
    84.74,85.74
     and damage and
},
{
    85.74,86.74
     causes pain.
},
{
    86.74,92.66
     Hence, in order to prevent this pain, it's important that these muscles need to be stretched
},
{
    92.66,94.26
     on a regular basis.
},
{
    94.26,101.56
     So now, without wasting any due time, let's understand how to perform these three stretches.
},
{
    101.56,106.8
     The first stretch that you need to do is a calf muscle stretch. For this, you need to
},
{
    106.8,112.4
     take the help of thera-band and place it on your forefoot. Now pull this thera-band towards
},
{
    112.4,142.04
     yourself. Hold this for 20 to 30 seconds and then relax. You need to perform this stretching 3 repetitions.
},
{
    142.04,147.0
     The next stretch is for hamstring muscle, the muscle that lies behind your thigh.
},
{
    147.0,153.5
     For this, place your leg over a stool, bend forward from the hip and try to touch your

     Hold the position for 20-30 seconds and then relax. You need to perform this particular stretching exercise for three reputations.

     And the third muscle that needs to be stretched is the quadricep muscle or else the front thigh muscle.
},
{
    189.0,197.0
     For this, you need to stand straight with the help of some support and then bend your knee and try to touch your heel to the hips.
