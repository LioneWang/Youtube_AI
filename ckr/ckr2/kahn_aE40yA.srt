},
{
    28.48,32.24
     second stretch and a little 10 second rest in between. So I've got my timer
},
{
    32.24,38.58
     ready to go and I'll kind of just explain it as we get started. So for the
},
{
    38.58,43.4
     levator scap which is this muscle here you're gonna bring your arm up up the
},
{
    43.4,50.64
     side you want to stretch. Try and get that elbow as high as you comfortably can and then gently pull your head towards the opposite knee.
},
{
    50.64,56.32
     So you're just going to go down in this direction and that's stretching this muscle right through
},
{
    56.32,63.2
     here. And the purpose of bringing this side up is to hold that scapula or that shoulder blade down.
},
{
    63.2,66.48
     So it's going to give you a better stretch.
},
{
    66.48,68.88
     If you have a lot of pain there
},
{
    68.88,70.98
     and you feel like that's too much,
},
{
    70.98,72.76
     you don't have to put that arm up.
},
{
    72.76,74.8
     You can still stretch over to the side,
},
{
    74.8,76.04
     but if you can bring it up,
},
{
    76.04,78.44
     it really kind of pushes it down
},
{
    78.44,79.92
     so you can get that good stretch.
},
{
    79.92,82.84
     And if you can't, again, if that feels like it's too much,
},
{
    82.84,84.12
     just bring that arm down,
},
{
    84.12,89.38
     but maybe try and push it down a little bit, or maybe even sit on it if you can, again if that feels like it's too much, just bring that arm down but maybe try and push it down a little bit or maybe even sit on it if you can. That
},
{
    89.38,92.9
     will give you a little bit more of a stretch there as well. But the best way
},
{
    92.9,96.98
     to do it is kind of just resting that hand on the back of the shoulder and
},
{
    96.98,100.76
     then pushing that elbow up as much as you can. But make sure you're getting an
},
{
    100.76,106.38
     angled stretch here so it's not over towards the side, it's not
},
{
    106.38,111.42
     straight down, it's at that angle. And this is really important because that
},
{
    111.42,116.64
     levator zap muscle is the one that elevates our shoulder blades. So when
},
{
    116.64,123.54
     we're sitting at a desk working all day, a lot of times our our shoulders start
},
{
    123.54,125.82
     hunching up and we overwork those
},
{
    125.82,131.04
     muscles and they get really tired and petite. So this is a great stretch just
},
{
    131.04,135.72
     to get it all nice and loosened up and relax everything and start everything
},
{
    135.72,143.2
     kind of over again. And it also the muscle connects down here to your scapula
},
{
    143.2,146.24
     but it goes all the way up into the neck as well.
},
{
    146.24,153.12
     So sometimes this can cause some shoulder pain, it can cause neck pain, it can cause tension headache
},
{
    153.12,158.16
     sometimes. So again, this is a really important one just to get it all stretched out. So again,
},
{
    158.16,164.88
     bringing that arm and that elbow up, and then just gently pulling down towards the opposite knee.
},
{
    164.9,170.26
     that elbow up and then just gently pulling down towards the opposite knee. And a lot of times after you're doing it more, you'll feel it just get a little
},
{
    170.26,174.34
     more stretch. You can pull just a little bit more, but you don't ever want that
},
{
    174.34,178.34
     stretch to be painful. You just want to feel some tension in there. So if you're
},
{
    178.34,183.58
     feeling some pain, maybe back off a little bit up here or just go ahead and
},
{
    183.58,190.26
     bring that arm down and get that little stretch in there as well. So the the rest break in between if you
},
{
    190.26,194.02
     want to kind of shake out the shoulders a little bit you can if you want to kind
},
{
    194.02,198.34
     of rub these out a little bit you can do that as well but then just going right
},
{
    198.34,203.58
     back into that stretch and gently pulling over. Make sure you're not pulling
},
{
    203.58,205.52
     your whole body over like that. I've
},
{
    205.52,210.96
     had some people try and do that. You want to keep your back upright and just get that pull at your
},
{
    210.96,217.84
     neck so you're really getting that good stretch right through there. So nice hold, getting that
},
{
    218.4,230.2
     stretch, and then just looking straight down towards that opposite knee. And if you feel like you're getting
},
{
    230.2,236.4
     more of like a pinchy pain versus a stretchy pain, make sure you stop. Make
},
{
    236.4,240.12
     sure you talk to your doctor or physical therapist about it because if
},
{
    240.12,244.24
     you're not getting a stretch with this, if you're just getting pain, you might
},
{
    244.24,247.56
     have something going on where you actually don't need to be stretching
},
{
    247.56,252.42
     this out. But if you don't have any injuries, and again if you're working at
},
{
    252.42,256.68
     your desk all day long, or if you're driving a lot, if you drive a lot of the
},
{
    256.68,259.88
     day and you're kind of holding on that steering wheel and those shoulders kind
},
{
    259.88,272.92
     of inch up like that, this is a great stretch to kind of work those muscles back out for you. So there you have it, the 30 seconds, three times on each side for the Levators gap stretch. So
