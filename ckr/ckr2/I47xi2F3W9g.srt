     Welcome everyone, Dr. Mandela here. There's a lot of viruses, bacteria, and pollen in

     the air. When it comes to congested sinus, pain in your sinus region, as well as that old stuffy nose. Here is something that's going to
},
{
    26.72,33.04
     make huge changes within seconds. We're going to be focusing with the perinazle
},
{
    33.04,40.08
     sinuses as well as a reflex from the brain to get that instant drainage and
},
{
    40.08,45.52
     open up that stuffy nose. If you look here, the perinazle sinuses
},
{
    45.52,47.68
     is made up of four sinuses.
},
{
    47.68,51.36
     You have the ethmoidal sinus, the spinoidal sinus,
},
{
    51.36,56.02
     the frontal sinus, as well as the maxillary sinus.
},
{
    56.02,58.76
     And they are all interconnected.
},
{
    58.76,62.36
     But the majority of sinus conditions that we have
},
{
    62.36,67.4
     are generally behind the cheekbones and up in the frontal
},
{
    67.4,68.4
     sinus.
},
{
    68.4,75.88
     Well, we're going to be stimulating the zygomatic bone, which is our cheekbone, as well as pulling
},
{
    75.88,79.9
     on our ears to open up the eustachian tubes.
},
{
    79.9,86.36
     Those eustachian tubes are connected from the back of the nasal region to the middle ear.
},
{
    86.36,93.4
     But when those use station tubes become congested, we can experience lots of pain, clicking in
},
{
    93.4,99.88
     our ear, tinnitus, ringing in our ears, as well as vertigo, which is that dizziness.
},
{
    99.88,103.08
     So let me show you how fast and effective this technique is.
},
{
    103.08,106.9
     So we can get your sinuses to drain and open up that stuffy nose.
},
{
    106.9,109.54
     Take your right thumb put underneath the cheekbone.
},
{
    109.54,112.92
     You're going to push in and out.
},
{
    112.92,117.4
     Take your other hand, contact the lower part of the ear, pull it straight out.
},
{
    117.4,119.56
     Hold it there 10 seconds.
},
{
    119.56,120.56
     Good.
},
{
    120.56,122.5
     Just keep holding it there.
},
{
    122.5,125.18
     You'll feel that left sinus open up.
},
{
    127.72,129.64
     Good, take your left thumb,
},
{
    129.64,131.56
     put it underneath the right cheekbone.
},
{
    131.56,135.04
     You're gonna push in and out, pushing it out.
},
{
    135.04,139.66
     Take your other hand, contacting the lower part of your ear,
},
{
    139.66,141.24
     pulling it straight out.
},
{
    141.24,143.24
     Hold it there 10 seconds.
},
{
    144.12,149.5
     Good, as we open up the right sinus region, keep
},
{
    149.5,156.98
     holding it and release. Now the majority of you should feel some type of drainage or dripping
},
{
    156.98,164.36
     immediately. Now we're going to work the nasal region. We're going to take our fingers and
},
{
    164.36,167.68
     squeeze our nose. We're going to take a deep breath.
},
{
    167.68,172.72
     And when we take that deep breath, bring your head back and hold your breath as long as you can.
},
{
    172.72,182.48
     Let's go. Deep breath, hold it, bring your head back. Keep holding it, holding that air in.
},
{
    190.92,196.38
     holding that ear in. Good. Keep your head back. Beautiful. This is going to interconnect with the brain, sending a reflex back to the sinus region and the nasal area to open it up. Keep
},
{
    196.38,225.0
     holding it. When you cannot hold it anymore, I want you to let go of your nose and breathe it all your ear out as your head goes back down.
