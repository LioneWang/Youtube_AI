     In this video we are going to show you deep cervical flexor and extensor exercises for a specific neck pain.

     Hi and welcome back to Physiotutors.

    20.5,26.0
     A systematic review by Lowetal in the year 2017 has shown that strengthening exercises
},
{
    26.0,30.96
     are an effective way to improve neck pain but also quality of life while the effects
},
{
    30.96,36.6
     of endurance training and stretching need further exploration.
},
{
    36.6,49.04
     Should we then do general strengthening exercises or exercises specific to the neck area. A study by Ludwig Zonendal in the year 2016 has found that neck specific exercises were
},
{
    49.04,55.32
     superior in terms of reduction of pain and disability in patients with whiplash associated
},
{
    55.32,56.32
     disorders.
},
{
    56.32,62.36
     So what about exercises for the deep neck flexors versus the more superficial neck muscles?
},
{
    62.36,67.6
     A study by Boris Zonendal in the year 2013 compared cranioservical
},
{
    67.6,73.76
     flexion exercises with a group performing progressive resistance exercises targeted at the more

    73.76,80.0
     superficial neck flexors and extensor muscles in a group of female office workers with chronic neck

{
    80.0,86.6
     pain. They found both a decrease in pain and disability in both groups, which means that
},
{
    86.6,91.24
     we are free to choose an exercise that best suits the patient in front of us.
},
{
    91.24,96.8
     For the cranioservical flexion exercise, have the patient in hook-lying position. An air-filled
},
{
    96.8,105.92
     pressure sensor is placed under the patient's occipit and inflated to 20 mm mercury. The subject then performs a head knot in order to increase
},
{
    105.92,113.44
     the pressure to 22 mm mercury. The pressure is subsequently held for 10 seconds, after
},
{
    113.44,120.92
     which a 10 second rest is allowed.
},
{
    120.92,127.0
     Perform 15 repetitions with 1 minute rest between sets and try to progress up to 30mm mercury.
},
{
    153.24,160.32
     Fun fact, a study of Parkedal in the year 2018 has found out that a mouth opening of 20mm coupled with a gaze of 45 degrees below vertical resulted in the lowest activation of the sternocleidum

{
    160.32,161.64
     mastoid muscle.
},
{
    161.64,169.96
     Alternatives to the pressure sensor can be performed in sitting position with or without an elastic band.
},
{
    194.32,199.78
     In order to incorporate the deep cervical extensor muscles such as the semi-spinalis services and the multifeedy have the patient in quadruped position.
},
{
    199.78,205.92
     After the initiation of a chin tuck, the patient is asked to move into flexion with his lower cervical
},
{
    205.92,219.32
     spine while keeping the chin tuck.
},
{
    219.32,225.04
     Afterwards the patient extends his lower and mid cervical spine again without losing the chin tuck.
},

    232.16,236.8
     Boris said that our reason that CCF exercises might benefit through better

{
    242.88,245.82
     flexor muscles. The study shows that
},
{
    245.82,250.86
     exercises were able to significantly decrease the activity of the cervical

     muscles which commonly have a hard time to relax in patients with neck pain.

     Alright this is our video on deep cervical flexor and extensor strengthening.
