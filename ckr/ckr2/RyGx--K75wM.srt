     You will begin taking insulin by injecting it with a needle into the subcutaneous tissue.
},
{
    9.76,13.84
     To determine when you should inject insulin, pay attention to the times you check your
},
{
    13.84,18.48
     blood sugar, when you eat, and what kind of insulin you are taking.
},
{
    18.48,22.2
     Check your blood sugar no more than 30 minutes before you eat.
},
{
    22.2,26.74
     If you are taking rapid acting insulin before meals, give yourself the insulin when you
},
{
    26.74,28.48
     sit down to eat.
},
{
    28.48,32.96
     If you are taking regular insulin before meals, give yourself the insulin no more than 30
},
{
    32.96,34.84
     minutes before the meal.
},
{
    34.84,39.96
     If you are taking intermediate acting or long acting insulin, give yourself the insulin
},
{
    39.96,42.72
     at the same time each day.
},
{
    42.72,45.8
     There is no standard or typical dose of insulin.
},
{
    45.8,48.32
     Your dose will be the amount of insulin that you need
},
{
    48.32,51.28
     in order to keep your blood sugar in good control.
},
{
    51.28,53.32
     Your doctor will prescribe an insulin dose
},
{
    53.32,54.88
     that is right for you.
},
{
    54.88,56.84
     The most common side effect of insulin
},
{
    56.84,59.72
     is low blood sugar or hypoglycemia.
},
{
    59.72,62.08
     Low blood sugar happens when the level of sugar
},
{
    62.08,67.12
     in the blood falls below 70 mg per deciliter.
},
{
    67.12,73.2
     Symptoms include sleepiness, shaking, sweating, dizziness, and hunger.
},
{
    73.2,91.48
     Be sure you know how to treat low blood sugar before you start using insulin. An insulin injection delivers medicine into the subcutaneous tissue, which is the tissue
},
{
    91.48,94.28
     between your skin and muscle.
},
{
    94.28,99.84
     Subcutaneous tissue, which is also called sub-Q tissue, is found all over your body.
},
{
    99.84,104.16
     Your healthcare provider has chosen insulin injections that are done with a syringe that
},
{
    104.16,108.26
     is filled from a bottle of insulin as the best option for you.
},
{
    108.26,110.76
     Here are the steps you will take.
},
{
    110.76,113.28
     Select a clean, dry work area.
},
{
    113.28,119.16
     The supplies you will need include the prescribed bottle of insulin, an insulin syringe, alcohol
},
{
    119.16,122.48
     wipes, and a container for used equipment.
},
{
    122.48,125.76
     You can use a hard plastic container with a screw on or tight
},
{
    125.76,132.48
     lid or a commercial sharps container. Begin by washing your hands. If the bottle of insulin
},
{
    132.48,138.16
     appears cloudy, roll the bottle in your hands and turn it from side to side for one full minute.
},
{
    138.16,143.12
     You do not have to roll the bottle if the insulin is completely clear. Do not shake the bottle.
},
{
    143.76,145.74
     If opening a new bottle of insulin,
},
{
    145.74,148.42
     remove the plastic cap and wipe the top of the bottle
},
{
    148.42,150.14
     with an alcohol wipe.
},
{
    150.14,152.94
     If using a bottle of insulin that has already been open,
},
{
    152.94,155.86
     you will still need to wipe the top or rubber stopper
},
{
    155.86,157.58
     with an alcohol wipe.
},
{
    157.58,159.98
     Remove the caps from both the top and bottom
},
{
    159.98,161.94
     of the insulin syringe.
},
{
    161.94,164.7
     You may need to twist the cap to get it to come off
},
{
    164.7,165.7
     more easily.
},
{
    165.7,167.86
     Do not touch the needle.
},
{
    167.86,170.1
     Pull back on the plunger to the unit mark
},
{
    170.1,173.22
     for the insulin dose that has been ordered for you.
},
{
    173.22,175.24
     Put the bottle on the table.
},
{
    175.24,177.78
     Insert the needle straight into the top of the bottle
},
{
    177.78,179.74
     through the rubber stopper.
},
{
    179.74,182.9
     Push the plunger down to inject the air into the bottle.
},
{
    182.9,185.2
     Turn the bottle upside down with the needle still in
},
{
    185.2,190.72
     it. Hold the bottle at eye level. Make sure the tip of the needle is in the insulin. Make sure not
},
{
    190.72,195.28
     to bend the needle when picking up the bottle. Pull the plunger back to the unit mark for the
},
{
    195.28,200.88
     insulin dose ordered for you. If you see bubbles in the syringe, gently tap on the syringe so the
},
{
    200.88,208.72
     bubbles move to the top. Push the syringe to release the bubbles back into the bottle of insulin. Once again, with the needle in the insulin,
},
{
    208.72,212.84
     pull the plunger back to the unit mark for insulin dose that has been ordered
},
{
    212.84,217.6
     for you. Check that the dose is correct. Set the syringe down without letting the
},
{
    217.6,220.56
     needle touch anything.
},
{
    234.06,236.18
     Since you will be injecting your insulin on a regular basis, you need to know where on your body to inject it.
},
{
    236.18,241.5
     You will also need to learn how to rotate or switch your injection sites.
},
{
    241.5,246.72
     Recommended injection sites include the abdomen, front and side of the thighs, upper and outer
},
{
    246.72,249.04
     arms, and buttocks.
},
{
    249.04,256.0
     Do not inject near joints, the groin area, the navel, the middle of the abdomen, or scar
},
{
    256.0,257.34
     tissue.
},
{
    257.34,262.78
     If you use the same injection site over and over again, you may get hardened areas under
},
{
    262.78,266.72
     your skin that keep the insulin from working properly.
},
{
    266.72,273.32
     Rotating your injection sites will make your injections easier, safer, and more comfortable.
},
{
    273.32,275.2
     Follow these guidelines.
},
{
    275.2,278.6
     Ask your healthcare provider which sites you should use.
},
{
    278.6,281.92
     The injection site is about 2 inches of skin.
},
{
    281.92,286.48
     Clean this area in a circular motion with an alcohol wipe. Move the site
},
{
    286.48,293.68
     of each injection. Inject at least 1.5 inches away from the last spot where you injected.
},
{
    293.68,299.24
     Try to inject in the same general area of your body at the same time each day. Keep a record
},
{
    299.24,307.28
     of which injection sites you have used. Every time you give yourself an injection, write down the date, time, and site.
},
{
    307.28,312.24
     Please note, depending on which type of insulin you are taking, absorption may be different
},
{
    312.24,316.64
     for different parts of the body. Talk to your healthcare provider to learn more about the
},
{
    316.64,335.56
     insulin you are using and which sites work best. Using the hand you write with, hold the syringe like a pen or a pencil, with the needle end
},
{
    335.56,336.56
     down.
},
{
    336.56,342.0
     With your other hand, pinch about 2-3 inches on both sides of the cleaned skin.
},
{
    342.0,345.54
     Insert the needle with a quick motion into the pinched skin at a 90
},
{
    345.54,350.7
     degree angle. The needle should go all the way into your skin. Slowly push the
},
{
    350.7,355.26
     plunger of the syringe until all of the insulin is pushed out. Stop pinching your
},
{
    355.26,360.52
     skin and pull the needle out. You may bleed at the spot of the injection. If you
},
{
    360.52,365.32
     notice bleeding, apply pressure with a clean alcohol wipe or a cotton ball.
},
{
    365.32,368.64
     Cover the injection site with a bandage if necessary.
},
{
    368.64,373.72
     Drop the entire syringe and needle into your container for use sharps equipment.
},
{
    373.72,376.08
     Do not put the cap back on the needle.
},
{
    389.72,391.76
     It's important to remember that when storing your insulin that you store unopened bottles in the refrigerator.
},
{
    391.76,396.0
     Unopened insulin that is stored in the refrigerator will be good until the expiration date printed
},
{
    396.0,397.56
     on the box.
},
{
    397.56,400.48
     Write the date on the bottle when you first open it.
},
{
    400.48,403.82
     Store the bottle you are using at room temperature.
},
{
    403.82,406.5
     Avoid temperatures that are too hot or too cold.
},
{
    406.5,409.0
     This can change how the insulin works.
},
{
    409.0,412.5
     Most insulin is good for 28 days once it's opened.
},
{
    412.5,417.0
     Check with your pharmacist or read the drug insert for exact instructions.
},
{
    417.0,423.0
     Always check your medicine type and the expiration date printed on the box before you leave the pharmacy.
},
{
    423.0,430.58
     Do not use insulin if it has lumps, is discolored, or has been frozen. Place used insulin syringes and
},
{
    430.58,435.8
     lancets for blood sugar testing in a hard plastic or metal container with a
},
{
    435.8,441.22
     screw-on or tight lid or a commercial sharps container. If you have questions
},
{
    441.22,446.0
     about the subcutaneous injection procedure, please ask your healthcare providers.
