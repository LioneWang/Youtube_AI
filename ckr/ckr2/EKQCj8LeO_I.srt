     In this video, let's go over how to fix a crooked lower back quickly and easily.
},
{
    4.48,5.12
     Stay tuned.
},
{
    10.24,13.84
     Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe here at SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan.
},
{
    13.84,19.28
     So if you have a lower back injury going on and you notice that you are just kind of tilted to one
},
{
    19.28,26.04
     side, that's pretty common with a lumbar disc issue. Your body has a self-defense mechanism
},
{
    26.04,30.04
     that will shift your weight away from the spot of pain.
},
{
    30.04,33.78
     We call that an antelgic position or an antelgic lean.
},
{
    33.78,37.18
     It's also known as a lateral shift to one side.
},
{
    37.18,39.08
     So how we're going to tackle this
},
{
    39.08,43.28
     and get you basically upright and not having a crooked back
},
{
    43.28,46.52
     is by doing three simple exercises
},
{
    46.52,48.04
     that you can do at home.
},
{
    48.04,50.36
     I guess you could do them at work if you really wanted to,
},
{
    50.36,51.68
     but they're really easy.
},
{
    51.68,53.72
     They don't require any special equipment,
},
{
    53.72,56.68
     and I think that you'll find that it helps very, very quickly.
},
{
    56.68,58.44
     It might even give you pain relief
},
{
    58.44,60.84
     as in little as 30 seconds.
},
{
    60.84,62.36
     So let's get started with them
},
{
    62.36,63.76
     and get you feeling better right now.
},
{
    63.76,67.64
     So the first exercise is done laying flat. You can do this in bed, you can do it on
},
{
    67.64,71.7
     the floor, on a yoga mat, whatever is more comfortable. But what you want to do
},
{
    71.7,77.44
     is put a pillow underneath the hips, the pelvis, and the stomach right here to
},
{
    77.44,81.4
     offer a little bit more support. So for the first part what I'm going to do is
},
{
    81.4,85.0
     just prop up on my elbows just like this.
},
{
    85.0,89.64
     You're going to put extension or backwards movement into the lower back right here that
},
{
    89.64,92.52
     helps facilitate a little bit more of a curve.
},
{
    92.52,95.24
     This takes pressure off spinal discs.
},
{
    95.24,101.32
     Again, spinal disc injuries in the lower back are the primary cause for this lateral shift.
},
{
    101.32,105.2
     We want to directly take pressure off those discs as quickly as we can to see if we can get this lateral shift, so we want to directly take pressure off those discs as quickly as
},
{
    105.2,109.76
     we can to see if we can get this lateral shift to go away.
},
{
    109.76,114.12
     So when I'm doing this exercise, if you are tilted to one side, you're going to notice
},
{
    114.12,117.8
     that when you lay flat, it's not comfortable to go straight.
},
{
    117.8,121.56
     You're going to be tilted kind of how you are when you stand up.
},
{
    121.56,128.74
     So when you do this, you start in a position where you feel comfortable with that you know, an intelligent lean towards the opposite
},
{
    128.74,133.74
     side. So in this one I'm mimicking a right intelligent lean right here. So I'm
},
{
    133.74,138.82
     going to do this position for about 15 seconds. I'm then just going to relax with
},
{
    138.82,146.38
     it. And what I'm going to do is slowly try to straighten myself and then repeat that process. I'm going
},
{
    146.38,151.6
     back up on my elbows and I'm trying to put a little bit more of a curve into
},
{
    151.6,156.4
     the lower back. Only go to your comfort levels. If this is causing more discomfort
},
{
    156.4,161.32
     you're going too far with it and discontinue and then slowly build into it
},
{
    161.32,165.34
     instead. But with this you should start to notice that you can just
},
{
    165.34,172.78
     slowly start to inch over further with each time that you do it until you are
},
{
    172.78,178.5
     completely straight. Once you are completely straight you then want to go
},
{
    178.5,184.26
     towards the opposite side very very slowly and keep repeating that process. So
},
{
    184.26,185.14
     what I'm doing is I'm
},
{
    185.14,190.5
     inching over towards my left only to the point where I feel a very good stretch
},
{
    190.5,195.62
     and not causing any more discomfort. And with this one you're going to notice
},
{
    195.62,200.58
     that you're increasing flexibility towards the opposite side. So after doing
},
{
    200.58,207.8
     this you should be able to go straight a lot more easily and with a lot less
},
{
    207.8,208.8
     pain.
},
{
    208.8,210.48
     It's very simple to do.
},
{
    210.48,212.84
     Give it a try and see if it makes a big difference.
},
{
    212.84,217.72
     With this next one, let's build off that first exercise and take it to the next level.
},
{
    217.72,221.44
     I'm going to be laying flat again with this one.
},
{
    221.44,225.74
     What I'm going to do, whatever side is primarily the focus of pain, like let's say
},
{
    225.74,230.02
     you have a lot of right-sided pain, maybe even like a sciatic pain going down the leg, you're
},
{
    230.02,234.92
     going to want to take that side's leg and then slowly start to bring it up towards the
},
{
    234.92,236.82
     upper body just like this.
},
{
    236.82,240.12
     It's almost like a position where an army guy is crawling on the ground.
},
{
    240.12,242.26
     That's the best way that I can explain it.
},
{
    242.26,244.76
     You want to just bring that up to your comfort level.
},
{
    244.76,246.96
     Give that about a 10 to 15 second hold.
},
{
    246.96,250.4
     And then from there, go back into the press-up stretch
},
{
    250.4,251.78
     that we did earlier.
},
{
    251.78,254.52
     You're going to want to give this a 15 to 30 second hold,
},
{
    254.52,257.16
     relax, and then repeat it a couple times.
},
{
    257.16,258.64
     What you're going to want to do then,
},
{
    258.64,262.2
     obviously, is start to inch over towards the center line
},
{
    262.2,263.32
     to straighten the back.
},
{
    263.32,269.48
     And just keep repeating that process slowly until you feel that you are in a straight neutral
},
{
    269.48,274.16
     position with your back. And then from there we're going to slowly start to
},
{
    274.16,279.4
     inch towards the opposite side to get that deeper stretch and really help that
},
{
    279.4,284.64
     intelligent lean. Once this becomes too easy we can progress even further by
},
{
    284.64,287.0
     then going into a full cobra pose like this.
},
{
    287.0,290.0
     We're just stretching the arms out completely.
},
{
    290.0,295.0
     You want to try to keep the hips, the pelvis flat as possible while doing this.
},
{
    295.0,299.0
     I tell you why. You're going to get a great stretch into the lower back.
},
{
    299.0,307.54
     This is an extension exercise that helps take pressure out of spinal discs and off-pinch nerves, which should help you with your
},
{
    307.82,312.32
     intelligently or your crooked back. From there, hold for 15 to 30 seconds,
},
{
    312.68,318.68
     relax, repeat it a couple times. And again, if you feel like you're starting off in a crooked posture,
},
{
    318.68,325.84
     you're going to want to just slowly progress until it's straight and then keep going towards the opposite side to get
},
{
    325.84,329.56
     that extra stretch that is going to help straighten you out.
},
{
    329.56,332.06
     This next one is based off the McKinsey method.
},
{
    332.06,333.64
     You can do this one standing.
},
{
    333.64,336.44
     You're going to do it against a door or a wall.
},
{
    336.44,338.04
     Start off by putting your feet together.
},
{
    338.04,342.18
     They should be spaced about 12 inches away from a wall.
},
{
    342.18,347.58
     You're going to want to put the side that does not hurt, so the good side, towards the
},
{
    347.58,348.58
     door.
},
{
    348.58,354.1
     What I'm going to do next is then put the good side's shoulder and arm directly against
},
{
    354.1,355.1
     the door.
},
{
    355.1,358.06
     My upper body weight is completely flush with it.
},
{
    358.06,360.26
     I should be kind of at an angle.
},
{
    360.26,364.1
     What I'm going to do is take the opposite side's hand, put it at the hip, and then I'm
},
{
    364.1,366.74
     going to drive it towards the door.
},
{
    366.74,368.98
     Just do this very, very slowly.
},
{
    368.98,373.4
     You should start to feel a very good stretch into that crooked lower back.
},
{
    373.4,376.26
     Only go to the point where you feel comfortable.
},
{
    376.26,382.5
     After you hit that point, hold it for 15 to 30 seconds, relax, and then repeat up to 3
},
{
    382.5,383.62
     to 5 times.
},
{
    383.62,385.16
     Each time you do this you should be
},
{
    385.16,390.72
     able to drive it a little bit further towards that door. But this one right here it just
},
{
    390.72,395.96
     puts a lot more motion into the back. It's very easy to do and it should help with that
},
{
    395.96,399.68
     crooked back. If you like the video and got a lot of relief please show us your support
