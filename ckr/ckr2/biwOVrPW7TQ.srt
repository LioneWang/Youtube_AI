     Now we're going to cover arterial bleeding in the workplace.
},
{
    26.46,30.5
     In this setup, what we saw as a person who knew he probably should have used something
},
{
    30.5,35.78
     to help put the wood through, but the problem was it was inconvenient, which is so common,
},
{
    35.78,41.44
     puts it down, uses his hand but slips and cuts his radial artery.
},
{
    41.44,45.12
     We know that it's an arterial bleed because it's pulsating and bright
},
{
    45.12,51.22
     red in color. Vanus bleeding is more oozing and is darker in color. Now when
},
{
    51.22,55.48
     we come across this most people automatically they grab their bleeding
},
{
    55.48,60.96
     part of their body. They put a hand over it. That's natural, it's normal, but they
},
{
    60.96,64.56
     may not even have a bandage. So when we respond we're going to make sure our
},
{
    64.56,69.48
     scene is safe, the machinery is off, our gloves are on and we're ready to rescue.
},
{
    69.48,74.2
     I like to come at least with a 4x4 or a 5x9 immediately. Sir, I'm going to go ahead and
},
{
    74.2,80.32
     replace your hand with this 4x4. Ready? Go ahead and change it out. Now we saw that it
},
{
    80.32,90.14
     was obviously pulsating. Go ahead and put pressure on that right there there you go he puts direct pressure himself he can assist as long as he's
},
{
    90.14,95.06
     conscious and not losing responsiveness I can see that it's already leaking
},
{
    95.06,99.28
     through so I don't take the first one away go ahead and cover that now and I
},
{
    99.28,109.04
     put a second one on there he puts firm pressure it you know getting it above the heart was something that we used to teach, but again, if they're not
},
{
    109.04,114.0
     comfortable doing that, it's more important to put the direct pressure instead of worrying
},
{
    114.0,119.68
     about elevating it. We're sitting the person down so that if they do get a little light-headed,
},
{
    119.68,123.76
     they're in a sitting position. Eventually, maybe a chair, and if it gets real bad, we'll
},
{
    123.76,126.44
     lower them all the way down to the ground.
},
{
    126.44,131.16
     Now once we have controlled the bleeding, and it's not like arterial bleeding cannot
},
{
    131.16,136.6
     be controlled with direct pressure, it's something that we need to keep an eye on.
},
{
    136.6,142.72
     Every time we see it starting to leak through, we put another fresh bandage, here's a 5x9,
},
{
    142.72,150.36
     go ahead and put direct pressure there, and now we see that it's not leaking through this 5x9 bandage. Here's a 5x9, go ahead and put direct pressure there. And now we see that it's not leaking through this 5x9 bandage. If we could not control
},
{
    150.36,157.36
     this arterial bleeding, we might move to a proper tourniquet device. This is for
},
{
    157.36,163.04
     delayed emergency response of greater than 10 to 15 minutes. Major arterial
},
{
    163.04,166.68
     bleeding that cannot be controlled and life
},
{
    166.68,171.04
     threatening bleeding that if we don't stop the bleeding the person's going to
},
{
    171.04,175.68
     lose their life. That's the proper use of tourniquets and when to use them. In
},
{
    175.68,181.6
     most cases direct pressure and pressure bandages are going to work just fine. You
},
{
    181.6,186.24
     can also make a makeshift tourniquet if you don't have a proper
},
{
    186.24,189.0
     tourniquet device. In this case we're
},
{
    189.0,190.56
     controlling it with direct pressure.
},
{
    190.56,193.26
     Now it's not leaking through. The
},
{
    193.26,195.52
     person's consciousness is fine. He's
},
{
    195.52,197.52
     responding to me well. He's still helping.
},
{
    197.52,199.04
     And now I'm going to go ahead and wrap
},
{
    199.04,202.48
     this sir. I wrap it from the distal end
},
{
    202.48,204.52
     which means all the way to the end. I
},
{
    204.52,207.36
     start at the end of the extremity.
},
{
    207.36,210.92
     I'm using an ace wrap to hold pressure with this,
},
{
    210.92,214.36
     so it could actually work like a tourniquet by accident.
},
{
    214.36,215.36
     Not my point.
},
{
    215.36,217.36
     And I'm going to show you how to check to make sure
},
{
    217.36,220.52
     we're not causing a tourniquet in just a minute.
},
{
    220.52,223.32
     But I'm able to wrap that pad in place.
},
{
    223.32,224.08
     Look it.
},
{
    224.08,228.0
     If I need a little extra pressure once I get over the wound itself,
},
{
    228.0,231.52
     I do a little twist. Then I come back around,
},
{
    231.52,235.84
     another little twist straight over it, and now I can finish out that bandage.
},
{
    235.84,239.2
     And now I just tuck the end
},
{
    239.2,242.96
     into the actual ace wrap to hold it there. Now,
},
{
    242.96,245.72
     I want to check nail beds. I squeeze the
},
{
    245.72,249.84
     nail bed and look at this. You can see that when I pinch the nail bed and it
},
{
    249.84,254.96
     blanches white and then I let it go, it only takes like one to maybe two seconds
},
{
    254.96,259.64
     to refill with blood. That's what tells me this is not so tight that it's cutting
},
{
    259.64,263.88
     off circulation, but it's tight enough that it's holding direct pressure and
},
{
    263.88,265.18
     keeping the arterial
},
{
    265.18,268.82
     bleeding from still losing a certain amount of blood.
},
{
    268.82,270.64
     So this is a great vantage.
},
{
    270.64,275.3
     Now we can decide whether we're going to transport this patient to the emergency room by private
},
{
    275.3,278.62
     vehicle or whether we need to activate EMS.
},
{
    278.62,283.22
     At the point that this person started to lose consciousness or show signs of shock like
},
{
    283.22,286.5
     cool, pale, sweaty skin, decreased
},
{
    286.5,290.88
     level of consciousness or I could not get this bleeding to stop and they were losing
},
{
    290.88,292.38
     a large amount.
},
{
    292.38,297.16
     That's when I activate EMS by calling 911 and get help on the way and treat the patient
},
{
    297.16,300.1
     for shock or any other life threatening conditions.
},
