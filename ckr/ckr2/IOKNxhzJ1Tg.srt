     Hey everybody, it's Doctor Jo and Princess Remy and today I'm going to show you my 10
},
{
    6.6,10.4
     best stretches and exercises for a herniated cervical disc.
},
{
    10.4,12.12
     So let's get started.
},
{
    12.12,16.8
     Disclaimer alert, disclaimer alert.
},
{
    16.8,21.12
     So the first stretch is kind of a stretch and an exercise and that's going to be a chin
},
{
    21.12,22.12
     tuck.
},
{
    22.12,23.12
     Chin tucks are one of my favorites.
},
{
    23.12,25.8
     Not only do they help if you have a disc issue in your neck,
},
{
    25.8,29.3
     but they also help just kind of re-correcting your posture.
},
{
    29.3,31.0
     And so they're really easy to do.
},
{
    31.0,32.4
     You can do them almost anywhere.
},
{
    32.4,35.9
     So a chin tuck is not tucking it down like this,
},
{
    35.9,38.3
     but you're tucking your chin in.
},
{
    38.3,41.3
     So you're trying to get that neck into a normal position.
},
{
    41.3,45.36
     So I like to sometimes just use my finger as a target. So I'm
},
{
    45.36,49.84
     going to keep my finger here and I'm going to try and bring my chin away from
},
{
    49.84,54.92
     it. So I'm taking my head and moving it backwards and then so just holding it
},
{
    54.92,58.7
     for about three to five seconds and then relaxing. A lot of times once you
},
{
    58.7,61.72
     relax there's a little bit of space in between your finger and that means that
},
{
    61.72,68.0
     it just gives you a good visual feedback that you're actually resetting those muscles getting you back into that position. So you
},
{
    68.0,73.12
     don't have to put your finger there, you can just pull that chin in and you can see it
},
{
    73.12,76.72
     kind of flattens out and gives me a bunch of little chins right there and then again
},
{
    76.72,80.92
     holding that for three to five seconds and then coming back. So sometimes this is a little
},
{
    80.92,86.16
     hard for people if they've got some stiffness in their neck or even if they have that disc issue in their neck.
},
{
    86.16,90.6
     But just work on it a little bit and the more you do it, the more you'll actually be able
},
{
    90.6,92.96
     to get that head actually going back.
},
{
    92.96,98.12
     But keep that chin in that neutral position so it's not tucking in like that or tucking
},
{
    98.12,99.12
     in like that.
},
{
    99.12,104.16
     You're really just bringing it straight back and then letting those muscles kind of relax
},
{
    104.16,105.76
     once you let it go.
},
{
    105.76,109.72
     So then the next one is going to be isometric exercises for your neck.
},
{
    109.72,114.28
     And isometric exercises are really, you're activating the muscle but you're not really
},
{
    114.28,115.28
     moving it.
},
{
    115.28,120.24
     So it does a good job of kind of getting some stiffness out of the muscles, starting to
},
{
    120.24,124.16
     get some strength in the muscles, but you're not doing the big movements that might still
},
{
    124.16,128.46
     hurt your neck at the time. So what you're gonna do is we're gonna
},
{
    128.46,133.46
     start off with what would be a side bend but again I'm not actually moving into
},
{
    133.46,138.36
     that side bend. I'm gonna place my hand on my head and then push into it. You
},
{
    138.36,143.34
     should see my muscles here activating a little bit and just again a three to five
},
{
    143.34,149.16
     second hold and then relax. I'm not pushing as hard as I can especially the first couple times I do
},
{
    149.16,154.76
     these isometrics. I'm doing maybe 20 to 30% of my push and then later on the
},
{
    154.76,159.8
     next day if it's not sore then I can push 40 to 50 and then 60 you know in the
},
{
    159.8,163.28
     70 and so forth but make sure you're doing both sides so then this is the
},
{
    163.28,169.52
     movement I would do and then I'm pushing in three to five seconds and then relaxing. Do
},
{
    169.52,173.04
     five on each side. You can alternate back and forth if you want or you can
},
{
    173.04,176.08
     just do them all on one side and then do all on the other side. But make sure
},
{
    176.08,180.56
     you're doing both sides. So the next isometric one is turning your head
},
{
    180.56,190.04
     from side to side and so that would be what we would call rotation. So again, I'm just placing my hand here. I would be turning into my hand. So then
},
{
    190.04,193.68
     again, I'm pushing, but now I'm getting the rotational movement. So you can
},
{
    193.68,197.64
     probably see a little bit of those muscles activating that three to five
},
{
    197.64,203.48
     seconds, then my hand on the other side, and then I'm turning in that way. So three
},
{
    203.48,208.44
     to five seconds, five on each side. I like to alternate back and forth but you can do them all on one side
},
{
    208.44,214.32
     if you want to. So then the next one is going to be to get some neck or cervical
},
{
    214.32,219.8
     extension. And so when we have a disc issue, a lot of times if you can get that
},
{
    219.8,231.28
     extension movement at the right level, you're gonna actually kind of push that disc back in a little bit. So using a towel to kind of stabilize the bottom
},
{
    231.28,235.04
     part so you can move the top part actually does a really good job. So I'm
},
{
    235.04,240.76
     gonna put the towel you know around this one level and then it's staying and
},
{
    240.76,245.28
     then I'm gonna move my head back into that extension. So you're
},
{
    245.28,248.58
     probably not going to be exact to start off with so sometimes I say just move it
},
{
    248.58,253.24
     up a little bit each time. But what I'm going to do is I'm taking this towel and
},
{
    253.24,257.58
     I'm pulling it forward this way to help kind of stabilize the bottom
},
{
    257.58,262.8
     part of the spine. So I'm pushing or pulling forward and then I'm just going
},
{
    262.8,265.92
     to look back and up going into that
},
{
    265.92,271.34
     extension. So doing that motion at the same time while I'm pushing forward. So
},
{
    271.34,276.26
     I'm stabilizing that bottom segment and moving that top one and you can go at
},
{
    276.26,282.34
     each level of your spine and just do maybe five to ten of those at each one
},
{
    282.34,287.64
     and that really helps kind of loosen everything up. It's a really nice way to get some movement in there.
},
{
    287.64,291.0
     So now we wanna stretch out all the muscles around our neck.
},
{
    291.0,292.88
     So we got some big muscles in the back.
},
{
    292.88,295.72
     We've got some smaller muscles up in the front.
},
{
    295.72,297.84
     So let's start off with an upper trap stretch.
},
{
    297.84,301.04
     And that's that big top of the triangle muscle
},
{
    301.04,302.04
     in the back of your neck.
},
{
    302.04,303.72
     And a lot of times when it's tight,
},
{
    303.72,307.48
     it's putting a lot of pressure on your cervical spine in that neck area and
},
{
    307.48,313.9
     pushing on that disc. So when you're gonna stretch your upper trap, I like kind
},
{
    313.9,317.66
     of sitting on my hand of the side that I want to stretch. And what that does is
},
{
    317.66,322.38
     that just keeps that shoulder down. You don't have to sit on it, but I feel like
},
{
    322.38,326.32
     you're gonna get a better stretch. Then all you're gonna do is take your other hand and
},
{
    326.6,331.48
     Pull your head gently towards the opposite side like I'm trying to take that ear to the other shoulder
},
{
    331.48,333.64
     But keep this shoulder down. Don't bring it up
},
{
    333.76,339.2
     But just gently pull over this way and you should feel that stretch right in through here
},
{
    339.2,342.6
     So nice gentle stretch just holding that stretch
},
{
    342.7,349.96
     So since this is a full stretch you want to hold it for 30 seconds and then switch sides. So sitting here,
},
{
    349.96,353.96
     pulling it over, gently getting that stretch and doing three on each side.
},
{
    353.96,358.24
     Again, I like to alternate back and forth just because that makes it where you
},
{
    358.24,362.24
     can give each side just a little bit of a break. So before I go on to my next
},
{
    362.24,368.24
     exercise, I want to do a wall of thanks for some of my folks that have supported me on the wall of thanks and so
},
{
    368.24,373.8
     Catherine H, Louise W, and Elon M. Thank you so much for supporting me and if
},
{
    373.8,378.16
     you're interested in being on the wall of thanks find out how by clicking on the
},
{
    378.16,382.8
     link in the description below. So the next stretch is going to be for our
},
{
    382.8,390.1
     levator scab and that levator scapulae muscle is the one that kind of holds our shoulders up, elevates it or lifts it.
},
{
    390.1,395.2
     And when we have a lot of stress and tension, that's the muscle that really holds a lot of that tension.
},
{
    395.2,401.7
     So it gets tight a lot, comes all the way up into the neck, so it can put a lot of pressure on that neck or that cervical area.
},
{
    401.7,408.28
     So this time, the side that you want to stretch, you're going to put your hand up where you're trying to bring your elbow up
},
{
    408.28,412.6
     towards the ceiling. Now sometimes people can't do that, that's okay. You can also
},
{
    412.6,416.72
     just raise your arm up but you don't have to do that either. This is just now
},
{
    416.72,420.72
     that's pushing that shoulder blade or that scapula down to give you a better
},
{
    420.72,423.64
     stretch. But you don't have to do that, I just feel like you're going to get a
},
{
    423.64,427.76
     better stretch. So I'm going to bring this side up of the side that I want to stretch, and then
},
{
    427.76,434.4
     I'm going to take my other hand and put it behind my head. I'm going to pull down at an angle about
},
{
    434.4,440.48
     a 45 degree angle towards my opposite knee. So I want my nose to point towards my opposite knee
},
{
    440.48,446.96
     when I'm going down. So I'm stretching this way. So it's not stretching to the side, it's not stretching forward, it's stretching at
},
{
    446.96,451.84
     that angle to really get that stretch right through back there. That's where
},
{
    451.84,457.92
     you should feel that stretch. So again, this is a full 30-second hold and you
},
{
    457.92,462.64
     want to do three on each side. So then the next stretch is going to be for your
},
{
    462.64,470.52
     anterior scalene muscles. These are the ones in the front here. So the way to stretch those is to take your
},
{
    470.52,476.44
     opposite hand and kind of push down on your collar bone and that just again
},
{
    476.44,480.4
     kind of helps stabilize everything. Then you're going to turn towards the side
},
{
    480.4,484.64
     that you want to stretch and look up towards the ceiling. And so you can see
},
{
    484.64,487.44
     right here that's where I'm getting all those stretch of those scaling
},
{
    487.44,488.76
     muscles right there.
},
{
    488.76,493.76
     And so again, you're holding that for 30 seconds and doing three on each side.
},
{
    493.76,496.28
     So really getting it nice and stretched out.
},
{
    496.28,499.84
     So then we're going to go into some exercises where we are getting some movement.
},
{
    499.84,502.92
     So the next one is just going to be scapular squeezes.
},
{
    502.92,505.04
     And our scapulae
},
{
    505.04,509.84
     have more than 20 muscles attached to them and a lot of them go up into our
},
{
    509.84,513.08
     neck so that's really why it's important to get those moving, get everything
},
{
    513.08,517.64
     moving in the right place. So for a scapular squeeze you want to almost
},
{
    517.64,521.64
     imagine that somebody's hand is on your spine and you're just going to squeeze
},
{
    521.64,529.0
     those shoulder blades back. Now you can use your elbows to kind of guide your shoulder blades going back,
},
{
    529.0,534.0
     but don't just use your elbows. So see, if I'm just using my elbows, I'm not actually getting that squeeze.
},
{
    534.0,538.0
     But sometimes when you first start doing it, you can get a better squeeze if you use your elbows,
},
{
    538.0,541.0
     but you don't have to. You can just squeeze them back this way.
},
{
    541.0,544.0
     But try and keep your shoulders down when you're squeezing.
},
{
    544.0,549.84
     So you're not coming up like this, but you're squeezing down and back. Hold it for about
},
{
    549.84,554.32
     three to five seconds and then do ten of those a couple times throughout the day.
},
{
    554.32,558.24
     And that's really going to kind of help reset that and get some strengthening in there as well.
},
{
    558.88,567.28
     So then the next one is going to be lying down. And so the side that you want to work is going to be up on top.
},
{
    567.28,572.56
     So this one, if you can, you're going to lie down and put your arm just kind of out so you
},
{
    572.56,578.16
     can rest your head on it. So your head stays in a neutral position. So all I'm going to do is just
},
{
    578.16,584.08
     lift my head up to the side and come back down. So I'm working these muscles on the side, but I'm
},
{
    584.08,586.3
     supporting it in a neutral position and then bringing it up. So I'm working these muscles on the side, but I'm supporting it in a neutral position and
},
{
    586.32,591.22
     then bringing it up. So I'm trying to keep everything straightforward here. So I'm not looking up like this.
},
{
    591.34,597.54
     I'm not coming like this, but I'm really almost just trying to bring that ear towards my shoulder.
},
{
    597.56,599.56
     So this one you can do
},
{
    599.8,605.36
     10, 10 to 15, couple sets, couple times times throughout day, but make sure you're switching sides.
},
{
    606.48,613.28
     So then the next one, so you can get some extension, is to get it on all fours or in quadruped,
},
{
    613.92,619.36
     and you're going to just put your head in a neutral position here, and then you're going to lift up
},
{
    619.36,625.0
     into extension, and then come all the way down so you're getting that full motion and then
},
{
    625.0,629.68
     coming back up and again if you've got a disc issue you might not be able to
},
{
    629.68,633.36
     come all the way up without some pain so make sure it's a pain-free motion so if
},
{
    633.36,638.96
     you can only come up to about right there that's okay but each time try and go a
},
{
    638.96,643.84
     little bit more as long as it's in a comfortable position and then the last
},
{
    643.84,647.88
     one is just going to be a cat dog because again you want to kind of get that upper back as
},
{
    647.88,651.64
     well as that cervical area. And this is one of my favorite stretches it always
},
{
    651.64,655.6
     feels really good. So the cat stretch you're going to arch your back up and
},
{
    655.6,659.4
     tuck in your chin. So just like when a cat is stretching you're coming up like
},
{
    659.4,664.0
     this. Just hold it for about three to five seconds and then drop down into the
},
{
    664.0,667.76
     dog or some people call it a cow and then lift your head up again.
},
{
    667.76,670.4
     So again, you want it to be in a pain-free motion.
},
{
    670.4,675.1
     So if that's uncomfortable, you can bring your head down just a little bit and just alternate
},
{
    675.54,681.48
     back and forth maybe five times each way holding it three to five seconds.
},
{
    681.8,682.88
     So there you have it.
},
{
    682.88,687.6
     Those are my ten best stretches and exercises for a herniated cervical disc. If you'd like to help support my
