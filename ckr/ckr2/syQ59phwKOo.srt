     If we want to talk about health issues in California, then skin cancer needs to be right
},
{
    13.32,14.72
     at the top.
},
{
    14.72,20.32
     More than 8,000 new cases of melanoma, which is the most deadly form of skin cancer, will
},
{
    20.32,23.24
     be diagnosed here in California this year.
},
{
    23.24,25.48
     We're seeing an alarming trend.
},
{
    25.48,28.16
     More and more young women are being diagnosed
},
{
    28.16,30.8
     with more advanced stages of melanoma.
},
{
    30.8,33.2
     We're also seeing something else that's unusual.
},
{
    33.2,35.8
     We're now seeing more melanoma on the breast,
},
{
    35.8,37.6
     the trunk, and the groin.
},
{
    37.6,40.24
     And those are areas that aren't typically exposed
},
{
    40.24,41.2
     to sunlight.
},
{
    41.2,43.28
     So what's the culprit?
},
{
    43.28,46.2
     Most likely it's the tanning bed. So as a
},
{
    46.2,50.8
     dermatologist I would like to tell you what I think is important to know about
},
{
    50.8,57.52
     ultraviolet or UV radiation. There are two main types of ultraviolet rays. UVB is
},
{
    57.52,62.88
     the burning ray. That's easy to remember. That's the ray that causes sunburn on a
},
{
    62.88,69.0
     sunny day. UVA is a longer wavelength ray and it is the aging ray.
},
{
    69.0,73.0
     It goes through clouds, so that's what causes sunburn on a cloudy day.
},
{
    73.0,78.0
     Because it's a longer wavelength, it also penetrates the skin a little bit more deeply
},
{
    78.0,81.0
     and is responsible for photoaging.
},
{
    81.0,86.68
     Now, when UVB and UVA radiation accumulates in the skin, that's where we
},
{
    86.68,91.92
     get into trouble. It all happens at the DNA level. DNA is made of various
},
{
    91.92,97.52
     proteins. They're the building blocks of life, but UVA and UVB rays damage a
},
{
    97.52,103.16
     specific protein in your DNA. This damaged protein is responsible for tanning
},
{
    103.16,108.56
     your skin and it's the same protein that transforms a cell into producing skin cancer.
},
{
    109.76,115.2
     So now we know. Potentially life-threatening DNA damage can happen just when we tan our skin.
},
{
    115.76,118.8
     You don't even need to get a burn to increase your risk of skin cancer.
},
{
    119.44,123.76
     That's why I tell my patients that there is no such thing as a safe tan.
},
{
    123.76,127.32
     So what can you do today to help prevent skin cancer?
},
{
    127.32,129.44
     Well, the first thing you can do is stay out of the tanning
},
{
    129.44,130.72
     booth.
},
{
    130.72,134.4
     If you want a tan, spray it on or rub it on.
},
{
    134.4,137.48
     This is safe.
},
{
    137.48,140.12
     Tip number two, block it out.
},
{
    140.12,144.0
     This is a shot glass full of my SPF 30 plus sunscreen.
},
{
    144.0,148.0
     And this is how much you need to use 15 minutes before you go out in the sun
},
{
    148.0,150.56
     and every two hours that you are in the sun.
},
{
    150.56,154.16
     This is the same amount that you need to use after swimming and sweating.
},
{
    155.68,158.56
     Now that we have sunscreen on, it's time to cover up.
},
{
    158.56,163.2
     Here is my BroadBrim Sun Hat, my sunshirt with its tightly woven fabric.
},
{
    163.2,165.68
     This is my swim shirt and I always
},
{
    165.68,168.72
     remember my SPF 20 protective lip balm.
},
{
    168.72,172.16
     I keep this stuff handy so that I can grab it when I'm on the go.
},
{
    172.16,174.88
     Tip number three, time your exposure.
},
{
    174.88,179.52
     Did you know that the sun's rays are most intense between the hours of 10 and 2?
},
{
    179.52,187.94
     So if you're out in the sun at that time, find a tree or an umbrella or a pop-up, seek some shade, just knowing where the sun is
},
{
    187.94,190.76
     and acting responsibly can greatly reduce your risk
},
{
    190.76,192.16
     of skin cancer.
},
{
    192.16,195.6
     Remember, there will be over 8,000 new cases
},
{
    195.6,198.44
     of melanoma diagnosed at the state of California this year
},
{
    198.44,201.08
     and I don't want you to be one of them.
},
{
    201.08,202.6
     As far as fashion is concerned,
},
{
    202.6,206.08
     well, they're saying pale is the new tan anyway.
},
{
    206.08,209.96
     So with that in mind, have a SunSafe Day.
},
