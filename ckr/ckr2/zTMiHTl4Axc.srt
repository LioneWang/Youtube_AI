     Now let's cover rescue breathing for the healthcare professional on an adult patient.
},
{
    8.72,13.68
     Now in this case, we still need to make sure the scene is safe and that our gloves are on,
},
{
    13.68,20.68
     but when we assess the patient, our main point here is can we find a pulse or not?
},
{
    20.68,24.36
     And if we can't find one, we're going to be going on to CPR.
},
{
    24.36,28.8
     But if we do find a pulse and we're confident that it's a pulse, then we're going to be
},
{
    28.8,30.04
     doing rescue breathing.
},
{
    30.04,31.66
     And this is how it's going to look.
},
{
    31.66,32.66
     My scene is safe.
},
{
    32.66,33.76
     My gloves are on.
},
{
    33.76,36.28
     My rescue mask with a one-way valve is available.
},
{
    36.28,38.16
     Sir, are you all right?
},
{
    38.16,39.16
     Are you okay?
},
{
    39.16,40.24
     They don't respond.
},
{
    40.24,41.24
     I tap and shout.
},
{
    41.24,42.92
     Sir, can you hear me?
},
{
    42.92,44.4
     They still don't respond.
},
{
    44.4,46.48
     I activate EMS or I call a code.
},
{
    46.48,51.28
     You in the plaid shirt go call 911 and come back. I might need your help and if you can find an AED
},
{
    51.28,57.68
     please bring it with you. Now I'm going to head to Chin Lift, look for normal breathing,
},
{
    57.68,67.04
     and check for a pulse for no more than 10 seconds. Immediately I can feel a pulse, but the patient is not breathing normally. This includes
},
{
    67.04,73.68
     the potential for agonal respirations, which we've covered in other trainings, but it's not considered
},
{
    73.68,79.44
     real breathing. So this person is going to receive now one breath every five seconds
},
{
    79.44,84.64
     for a total of about two minutes before I reassess the pulse. And it looks like this.
},
{
    83.8,85.16
     total of about two minutes before I reassess the pulse. And it looks like this.
},
{
    89.1,92.36
     One, one thousand, two, one thousand, three, one thousand,
},
{
    92.36,93.54
     four, one thousand.
},
{
    97.16,100.44
     One, one thousand, two, one thousand, three, one thousand,
},
{
    100.44,101.7
     four, one thousand.
},
{
    104.32,107.68
     So I continue giving these rescue breaths one breath every
},
{
    107.68,114.88
     five seconds and in about two minutes I recheck for a carotid pulse. If the pulse is present
},
{
    114.88,120.52
     but the patient is not breathing I continue rescue breathing and I await EMS and I have
},
{
    120.52,130.44
     the AED here. Ready to go in case I lose the pulse as well. If at any time on my reassessment the breathing is not there and there is no carotid pulse,
},
{
    130.44,133.04
     I'm going to go immediately into CPR.
},
{
    133.04,138.0
     If my AED is present, I'm going to use the AED right away and I'll go into CPR mode.
},
{
    138.0,142.12
     And we'll continue this rescue breathing until help arrives or the patient revives.
},
