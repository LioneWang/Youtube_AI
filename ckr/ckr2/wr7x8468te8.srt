     you're going to follow two important protocol
},
{
    49.04,52.16
     for your recovery, which we call police protocol
},
{
    52.16,53.44
     and avoid harm.
},
{
    53.44,56.04
     I'm going to leave you a link underneath of this video
},
{
    56.04,58.36
     that you have to read through these two protocols
},
{
    58.36,60.6
     and follow them step by step.
},
{
    60.6,63.36
     If you follow the exercises and these two tips
},
{
    63.36,69.12
     that I should leave you in this basically video you can get a quicker recovery and actually be able to get back
},
{
    69.12,74.16
     to your sport quicker. Let's get started with the exercises one by one and you can
},
{
    74.16,79.68
     literally start your rehab routine right away. The first exercise that I'm going to
},
{
    79.68,83.04
     show you guys is going to be active range of movements for your hamstring.
},
{
    83.04,86.2
     Weeding a comfortable range of movements.
},
{
    86.2,88.28
     I'm going to show you how to do it and you can give it a try.
},
{
    88.32,93.08
     You're going to lie on your back and be presumed that your left hamstring is the
},
{
    93.08,94.4
     one that is actually injured.
},
{
    94.68,98.36
     We're going to hold the hands around basically hamstring,
},
{
    99.0,102.72
     lower basic fiber and we want to keep it not too tight,
},
{
    102.76,105.48
     just gently holding it there. And you want to keep it not too tight, just gently holding it there and you want to bring
},
{
    106.2,108.2
     the knee up, slow control down.
},
{
    108.72,113.72
     You want to go beat in the range that it feels comfortable. If you can get more range
},
{
    114.72,116.12
     that's fine.
},
{
    116.12,122.44
     You gently wants to challenge to get that range up and slowly down. It's basically
},
{
    123.12,125.72
     kind of like activation of your hamstring and your quads
},
{
    125.72,131.8
     at the same time, but it mostly is just basically active range of movements. We want to practice
},
{
    131.8,139.52
     this movement for three sets of eight to fifteen repetitions. I would say make sure
},
{
    139.52,145.68
     while you're doing this exercise, you are not actually applying too much pressure in the area that
},
{
    145.68,153.2
     is actually sore. You can practice this exercise once or twice a day if you find it comfortable.
},
{
    153.2,161.12
     You can basically progress it from 10 to 12 to 15 repetitions. The next exercise I'm going
},
{
    161.12,170.36
     to show you guys is going to be glute bridges, which is a simple exercise but it actually can strengthen your hamstring muscle in a cute phase.
},
{
    170.36,173.02
     You got to be very careful with this exercise, why?
},
{
    173.02,175.66
     Because you don't want to basically push it too much.
},
{
    175.66,179.28
     You want to go within the comfortable range and I'm going to give it a try and show you
},
{
    179.28,180.28
     how to try it.
},
{
    180.28,184.74
     You're going to lie on your back, feet, you want to keep your heel of your foot close
},
{
    184.74,189.72
     to your body, which means close to the glutes and hands next to your body.
},
{
    189.72,193.54
     You want to go through the beating range that you feel is comfortable.
},
{
    193.54,194.54
     Slow control.
},
{
    194.54,196.24
     You don't want to hold it too long at the top.
},
{
    196.24,200.08
     You can activate the glutes, slow down.
},
{
    200.08,206.9
     This basically can reduce the sensitivity on your hamstring and the closer the foot
},
{
    206.9,211.22
     are to your glutes, the easier it is.
},
{
    211.22,220.66
     You want to hold it there for seconds, slow control down, breathing in and out, slow
},
{
    220.66,225.04
     control down.
},
{
    229.84,230.24
     You can practice this exercise for three sets of eight to fifteen repetition.
},
{
    236.72,240.88
     Go within the range that you feel comfortable and make sure that your foot or not too far away from your body. Now the reason that I'm asking you to do that because if you keep the feet closer to the body,
},
{
    240.96,250.0
     you're activating more of the glutes and as soon as you get the foot, maybe further, you actually engage in more hamstring. We're going to keep that exercise
},
{
    250.0,254.88
     with the challenge for the later stage of your injury, which means the last exercise that I'm
},
{
    254.88,261.2
     going to show you in this routine is going to be a progression of this basically exercise.
},
{
    261.2,264.56
     Just if you watch the video until the end, you can basically see that as well.
},
{
    264.56,267.04
     the exercise. Just if you watch the video until the end you can basically see that as well.
},
{
    271.84,277.12
     All right guys we're gonna go to the next move which is the slide movement with the towel or sliders. If you have at home I'm gonna show you both which is pretty straightforward. In this
},
{
    277.12,284.4
     exercise we're trying to basically and slightly use the hamstring muscle in acute phase which means
},
{
    286.8,291.04
     slightly use the hamstring muscle in acute phase, which means with movement that we create in this exercise, we kind of like challenge the hamstring fibers.
},
{
    291.04,293.32
     I'm going to show you how to do it, you can give it a try.
},
{
    293.32,297.92
     You're going to basically need a small towel, kitchen towel, or slide as if you have in
},
{
    297.92,299.52
     a seated position.
},
{
    299.52,305.72
     You want to gently go through the range that it feels comfortable and push back.
},
{
    305.72,309.56
     If you feel comfortable until there, that's fine.
},
{
    309.56,311.28
     You don't want to push it too much.
},
{
    311.28,312.28
     Slow control back.
},
{
    312.28,317.8
     Now, if you push more through your heel of your foot, you engage in more hamstring fibers
},
{
    317.8,322.64
     and literally you don't want to push too much now, which means you want to gently put your
},
{
    322.64,325.08
     foot there, slow control, the range
},
{
    325.08,329.34
     that you feel is comfortable and a slow control back.
},
{
    329.34,335.14
     Go through the basically comfortable zone, don't stretch it too much and back.
},
{
    335.14,339.94
     If you find it's getting easier, you can apply slight pressure on the heel and do the same
},
{
    339.94,347.14
     movement for three sets of eight to and basically 12 repetition. Now again in
},
{
    347.14,350.32
     some cases you might say well I can't really do this immediately after my
},
{
    350.32,355.0
     injury that's totally fine. If you find any of the exercises is aggravating your
},
{
    355.0,359.88
     pain too much in the hamstring you don't want to necessarily do that so often.
},
{
    359.88,364.56
     Maybe give it a try for other exercises and slow you back to that routine and
},
{
    364.56,365.36
     that specific
},
{
    365.36,367.36
     exercise after a few days.
},
{
    367.36,372.88
     Alright guys, we're going to move on to prone hamstring curls which is your body weight
},
{
    372.88,376.72
     and in time you can actually use the ankle and weight coughs.
},
{
    376.72,379.68
     I'm going to show you both options and you can give it a try.
},
{
    379.68,389.36
     You're going to lie down on the tummy and you are going to literally actively kill that hamstring. You
},
{
    389.36,396.28
     want to go through the range that it feels comfortable, slow control down and keep it
},
{
    396.28,404.64
     calm. Now this exercise looks simple but if you had a bad strain you can definitely feel
},
{
    404.64,406.52
     actually it can be challenging in acute
},
{
    406.52,407.52
     phase.
},
{
    407.52,412.92
     You want to make sure that we moving the body in acute phase to the point that actually
},
{
    412.92,417.4
     you create circulation and movement around the scar tissue and you're not leaving it
},
{
    417.4,418.4
     just alone.
},
{
    418.4,424.56
     Now, I would definitely suggest you guys while you are following these six songs, make sure
},
{
    424.56,429.18
     that you are getting the right diagnosis in terms of the location of your hamstring injury because
},
{
    429.18,433.24
     it is a proximal to distal hamstring injury.
},
{
    433.24,436.92
     Your rehab plan can be slightly different.
},
{
    436.92,441.24
     The basic information that I give you in this video is a general information about how you
},
{
    441.24,444.32
     can actually start your recovery in acute phase.
},
{
    444.32,446.08
     If you have a proximal specifically
},
{
    446.08,452.08
     hamstring injury, your timeline can be a little bit longer than this though and in that sense I suppose
},
{
    452.08,457.04
     contacting your physical therapist can be really beneficial. Now I'm going to show you the weighted
},
{
    457.04,476.88
     version of the same exercise and I do have weights here but if you don't have it you don't need to be too worried about it you can literally wrap these guys around your your foot they're kind of like handy in
},
{
    476.88,489.4
     a sense that you can actually get them bit of of extra weight and like literally they can be kind of like make
},
{
    489.4,493.8
     your workout a little bit challenging. You do the same thing but like literally
},
{
    493.8,499.48
     now you have a slight amount of weight. Now remember the downward phase when I'm
},
{
    499.48,508.76
     going down it actually has importance coming back up. In some cases even a lot of study has shown that the eccentric phase of the hamstring
},
{
    508.76,517.16
     curls is actually very more recruiting muscles that we need in sport and like literally for
},
{
    517.16,520.4
     your recovery can be a beneficial point.
},
{
    520.4,522.44
     As you can see I'm going down very slow.
},
{
    522.44,525.96
     I'm not coming over the 90 degrees because that's negative.
},
{
    525.96,528.88
     You wanna go up to there and slow control down.
},
{
    528.88,532.32
     To here, slow control down.
},
{
    532.32,535.6
     You can practice this exercise with the weight.
},
{
    535.6,537.46
     I suppose maybe with less repetition,
},
{
    537.46,540.4
     maybe three sets of eight,
},
{
    540.4,542.36
     and slowly build up to two, 12.
},
{
    543.76,545.4
     All right, guys, as I promised you guys,
},
{
    545.4,546.98
     you can actually progress your routine
},
{
    546.98,550.4
     with a very simple changes in your position of your foot
},
{
    550.4,553.84
     that you can actually try in this video.
},
{
    553.84,555.36
     I'm gonna show you in this routine,
},
{
    555.36,558.36
     you're gonna put your feet a little far away from your hip
},
{
    558.36,560.28
     in comparison to the first group beach that we did.
},
{
    560.28,561.92
     It's a little bit different.
},
{
    561.92,565.72
     You're gonna lie on your back, the same movement, now I can
},
{
    565.72,572.24
     feel more of my hamstring actually getting involved in lifting my hip off the ground,
},
{
    572.24,578.96
     slow control, back down again, all the way up, slow control down.
},
{
    578.96,587.3
     Now if I move this little bit far away, that actually engaging more of my hamstring in comparison to my glutes
},
{
    587.92,590.2
     I'm putting my heel on the ground
},
{
    591.2,597.86
     All the up and still control down now you got to be very and smart about this exercise because you don't want to
},
{
    598.4,602.36
     Push it and rush it too quick and you want to progress it gradually
},
{
    602.8,609.86
     Whenever you find the first few and exercise that I showed you are easy and getting easier you can add on this
},
{
    609.86,615.4
     routine and progress it. You can try this for three sets of A to 12 to 15
},
{
    615.4,620.46
     repetition and slowly progress them. Alright guys as I promised you earlier I
},
{
    620.46,623.94
     would like to share with you three important tips that you have to follow
},
{
    623.94,629.56
     with basic DDS exercises for your quick recovery. If you're suffering from hamstring injury
},
{
    629.64,636.3
     there are a couple of things that you should watch in your acute phase of your injury that can help you to fasten your recovery and
},
{
    636.32,641.68
     these three tips are gonna be first of all you don't want to stretch your hamstring in acute phase.
},
{
    642.04,646.52
     The reason that is your body basically tighten up your hamstring in a cute face. The reason that is your body basically tightens up your hamstring,
},
{
    646.52,648.44
     specifically the area that is injured
},
{
    648.44,649.72
     and you've got this strain,
},
{
    649.72,651.36
     and you want to basically stretch it
},
{
    651.36,653.52
     and work against your body.
},
{
    653.52,656.68
     You don't promote stretching in the first basically
},
{
    656.68,658.44
     two to three weeks for your hamstring.
},
{
    658.44,659.72
     As soon as you've got the recovery,
},
{
    659.72,661.36
     then you can install your buildup movement
},
{
    661.36,663.24
     and mobility exercises.
},
{
    663.24,665.48
     The second tip is that in many cases,
},
{
    665.48,668.44
     sitting in a prolonged can apply too much pressure
},
{
    668.44,672.56
     on your hamstring and we avoid those kind of activity
},
{
    672.56,674.8
     for prolonged, which means I wouldn't ask you to don't sit,
},
{
    674.8,676.96
     but if you know that you're sitting for prolonged,
},
{
    676.96,679.12
     apply that much pressure on the hamstring
},
{
    679.12,680.96
     and actually become discomfort.
},
{
    680.96,683.64
     And in some cases, I would definitely ask my patient
},
{
    683.64,688.92
     to avoid putting their wallet in their pocket, the back pocket and that increase more pressure
},
{
    688.92,693.16
     in their hamstring. Make sure to watch these two important tips. The last tips
},
{
    693.16,698.6
     is that you want to avoid heel walking or sprinting in the first two to three weeks
},
{
    698.6,702.88
     of your recovery while you're doing these exercises because those exercises can
},
{
    702.88,708.72
     aggravate your symptoms and I would suggest to look at any type of exercise or movement that you do that aggravate
},
{
    708.72,714.16
     your pain you want to minimize it in a cute face. I hope you guys find this
