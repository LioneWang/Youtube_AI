},
{
    31.26,33.84
     that'll help you along your sclerolens journey.
},
{
    33.84,36.04
     Now, inserting sclerolenses can be a bit tricky,
},
{
    36.04,37.98
     so I'm gonna walk you through how I feel
},
{
    37.98,39.4
     it works the best for me.
},
{
    39.4,41.42
     But if at any point you have trouble
},
{
    41.42,44.5
     with your sclerolenses, contact your local eye care provider.
},
{
    44.5,46.08
     Now, first thing, when dealing with contacts, whether you're putting them in or taking them lenses, contact your local eye care provider. Now, first thing when dealing with contacts,
},
{
    46.08,47.44
     whether you're putting them in or taking them out,
},
{
    47.44,48.6
     you're gonna be touching around your eye,
},
{
    48.6,51.24
     so make sure you wash your hands thoroughly.
},
{
    51.24,53.2
     Next, you wanna identify which contact lens
},
{
    53.2,54.2
     you're gonna be putting in.
},
{
    54.2,56.16
     I typically always start with my right eye
},
{
    56.16,57.42
     because I am right-handed.
},
{
    57.42,60.36
     That way I don't mix up which lens I'm putting in which eye.
},
{
    60.36,61.92
     It's just easier to build a habit out of it.
},
{
    61.92,64.16
     That way you don't have to try to remember which is which.
},
{
    64.16,65.44
     If you do ever mix up your lenses,
},
{
    65.44,68.0
     some brands do have little laser markings on them,
},
{
    68.0,70.6
     including little dots that'll tell you which eye
},
{
    70.6,71.96
     belongs to which.
},
{
    71.96,74.28
     Usually there's one dot for the right eye
},
{
    74.28,76.92
     and sometimes you'll see two dots for the left eye.
},
{
    76.92,78.28
     But ultimately, if you do mix them up
},
{
    78.28,80.56
     and you're not sure, contact your eye clinic for help.
},
{
    80.56,82.6
     Now when you remove the lens, you want to inspect it
},
{
    82.6,84.68
     to make sure there's no defects, no chips,
},
{
    84.68,85.98
     or any other problems.
},
{
    85.98,88.28
     Now there's a few different ways to insert scleral lenses.
},
{
    88.28,91.76
     However, I prefer to use a little plunger called a DMV.
},
{
    91.76,93.56
     Now a pro tip is if you get a DMV
},
{
    93.56,95.86
     and it does have the bottom being rounded,
},
{
    95.86,98.76
     you can go ahead and use the scissors to snip that off
},
{
    98.76,101.02
     because afterward you'll have a DMV
},
{
    101.02,102.8
     that has a little hole in the bottom.
},
{
    102.8,105.46
     And with this little hole, you can see a light passing through it
},
{
    105.46,106.84
     and the acts as a guide for you
},
{
    106.84,108.02
     when you're putting in the lens.
},
{
    108.02,110.22
     Now, you put the lens on the DMV like so,
},
{
    110.22,112.34
     and then you wanna fill the bowl completely
},
{
    112.34,115.1
     with non-preserved saline solution.
},
{
    115.1,117.22
     Otherwise, if you're using a multipurpose solution
},
{
    117.22,119.58
     of some kind for other types of contact lenses,
},
{
    119.58,121.3
     that solution will have preservatives
},
{
    121.3,123.34
     and those preservatives will get trapped on the eye
},
{
    123.34,125.0
     and that can lead to a chemical burn.
},
{
    125.08,130.16
     You can often buy this special type of saline solution from your eye clinic. Otherwise you can also find them online.
},
{
    130.16,132.68
     I'll include some resources in the description below. Now
},
{
    132.68,135.86
     you'll need to fill the bowl of the lens completely
},
{
    135.92,140.48
     all the way to the top. That way you can kind of see a bubble of fluid forming on the top.
},
{
    140.48,148.08
     If you don't fill the bowl completely, then you're likely going to get a bubble when you apply the lens and then you're not going to see well and the lens is going to move and it won't
},
{
    148.08,153.04
     be as comfortable. Now inserting the scleral lens you want to have your face completely parallel
},
{
    153.04,159.12
     to the floor. Some people find using a mirror or something as a fixation target on the counter
},
{
    159.12,163.2
     can help you with inserting the lens and getting it in the right spot. But again you want to be
},
{
    163.2,168.72
     facing down and parallel to the floor that way you don't spill the fluid out of the scleral lens when you're
},
{
    168.72,173.28
     trying to put it in. Now most people find it easiest to hold the scleral lens in one hand
},
{
    173.28,178.8
     while using the other hand to hold both eyelids open as you're putting the lens onto the eye.
},
{
    178.8,183.2
     Another pro tip is to keep both eyelids open during this whole process because that'll help
},
{
    183.2,186.44
     keep the eyelids open. As the eyelids are open wide,
},
{
    186.44,188.32
     push the lens onto the eye
},
{
    188.32,191.08
     while staring straight down toward the floor.
},
{
    191.08,194.7
     The lens will gently suction onto the eye and into place.
},
{
    194.7,197.44
     Naturally, some of the saline solution will be displaced
},
{
    197.44,198.84
     and spill out of the lens,
},
{
    198.84,200.76
     so expect it to be a little messy.
},
{
    200.76,202.2
     Don't be afraid, this whole process
},
{
    202.2,204.36
     can take a few tries if you're just starting out.
},
{
    204.36,207.28
     If you do find it challenging to hold both eyelids open
},
{
    207.28,209.48
     with just one hand, like maybe your eyelids
},
{
    209.48,212.12
     are just too strong, then perhaps considering
},
{
    212.12,214.92
     using what's called the S5 Inserter.
},
{
    214.92,217.12
     This is a special type of lens inserter
},
{
    217.12,220.2
     that will hold your scleral lens for you,
},
{
    220.2,222.08
     that suction's onto the counter,
},
{
    222.08,224.72
     and then you can just kind of hold both eyelids open
},
{
    224.72,225.04
     with both of your hands, and then you can just kind of hold both eyelids open with both of
},
{
    225.04,231.04
     your hands and then you can slowly dip your eye into the scleral lens having its suction on. For
},
{
    231.04,236.0
     a lot of people when you initially get the lens on things aren't perfectly clear. It takes a little
},
{
    236.0,241.44
     time for that lens to settle so if it's not fully clear right away consider that to be pretty normal.
},
{
    241.44,248.24
     Now next we're going to go over how to remove the lens but first if you're liking this video hit that like button for me and leave a comment below of what part of this video
},
{
    248.24,250.04
     you find most helpful.
},
{
    250.04,254.12
     Now to remove a scleral contact lens, there are again a couple of different methods that
},
{
    254.12,256.84
     you can use, however I still like to use a plunger.
},
{
    256.84,260.06
     This plunger is a little different than the first one we used, this one is a little smaller
},
{
    260.06,264.84
     and is the exact same one you can use to remove things like hard RGP lenses.
},
{
    264.84,269.56
     First you want to wet the plunger and then aim the plunger at the lower one-third of the scleral lens.
},
{
    269.64,274.52
     Then you will pull up and out until the scleral lens breaks suction.
},
{
    274.52,278.6
     At the same time you can push on the side of the eye and that'll help break suction from the lens.
},
{
    278.6,281.16
     Try not to put the plunger directly on the center of the eye,
},
{
    281.16,286.16
     otherwise it's going to put too much pressure of suction on eye itself, and it's gonna be hard to get off.
},
{
    286.16,288.44
     Again, try to aim for the lower one-thread of the lens
},
{
    288.44,289.96
     so it acts kind of like a fulcrum
},
{
    289.96,291.8
     and is able to come off much easier.
},
{
    291.8,293.8
     And there, you did it, congratulations.
},
{
    293.8,295.12
     Now to clean and store the lens,
},
{
    295.12,297.08
     make sure you use an approved solution
},
{
    297.08,299.72
     for hard RGP or scleral lenses,
},
{
    299.72,301.44
     or just follow the instructions
},
{
    301.44,303.04
     by your local eye care provider.
},
{
    303.04,304.84
     Again, this whole process is pretty difficult,
},
{
    304.84,306.4
     so don't feel discouraged if you didn't get
},
{
    306.4,307.72
     it on the first few tries.
},
{
    307.72,312.0
     But if you continue to have difficulties, make sure to ask your local eye care professional
},
{
    312.0,313.56
     for some more guided help.
},
{
    313.56,315.08
