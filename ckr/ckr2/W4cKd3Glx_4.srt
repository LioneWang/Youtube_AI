     Hey guys, Nicola here from City Physio and today I'm going to be showing you how to do
},
{
    3.92,10.32
     buddy taping on your fingers. Now buddy taping is a technique used for a finger sprain,
},
{
    10.32,15.84
     strain or even a small fracture but it can be a little bit tricky to do if you don't know what
},
{
    15.84,21.44
     you're doing. So what you're looking for is to grab some tape from your local pharmacy or even
},
{
    21.44,28.84
     supermarkets sometimes have your sort of tape there. You've got a couple of different kinds of tapes. This is rigid sports tape. It's got little
},
{
    28.84,32.96
     zigzags on the edges here making it hand terrible which means you can tear it
},
{
    32.96,36.64
     with your hands rather than scissors and then you've got this sort of style which
},
{
    36.64,41.72
     is more of an elastoplast. It's stretchy, it's very sort of adhesive in the
},
{
    41.72,45.4
     really sticky. My personal preference is not this tape
},
{
    45.4,50.56
     but this tape instead the more rigid version. Now that's just a personal
},
{
    50.56,54.52
     preference you can do all of the taping with this sort of tape I'll show you how
},
{
    54.52,60.04
     as well but if you can you're looking to grab this size or this type of tape. It
},
{
    60.04,67.16
     comes in a variety of widths don't worry too much on the width because you can actually just tear it smaller,
},
{
    67.16,68.56
     which is what I'm gonna do here.
},
{
    68.56,71.7
     So this tape here is 38 millimeters,
},
{
    71.7,73.68
     I'm pretty sure is the size.
},
{
    73.68,75.64
     What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna place a little nick
},
{
    75.64,76.56
     in the middle of that tape.
},
{
    76.56,77.94
     So I'm just gonna use my scissors here.
},
{
    77.94,79.12
     You can do this with your hands,
},
{
    79.12,81.68
     but of course I can never do it when I'm filming anything.
},
{
    81.68,82.88
     So I'm gonna use scissors
},
{
    82.88,85.36
     so that it's effectively split down the middle here.
},
{
    85.36,86.54
     So you can see that.
},
{
    86.54,88.52
     And then I'm just going to give it a yank.
},
{
    88.52,90.52
     And now I've got a smaller piece.
},
{
    90.52,94.72
     Now in true TV glory, here's what I prepared earlier.
},
{
    94.72,97.88
     So when you're using a roll of tape for a smaller piece,
},
{
    97.88,99.36
     you can kind of just keep pulling it off.
},
{
    99.36,101.6
     So you've got the two sides.
},
{
    101.6,104.56
     Now, when you have an ankle sprain,
},
{
    104.56,106.1
     we are assuming that you've injured what
},
{
    106.1,109.68
     we call the collateral ligaments. They are the ligaments on the sides of the
},
{
    109.68,114.0
     knuckles of your finger and we want to make sure that we protect those while
},
{
    114.0,119.16
     keeping any of the complications to a minimum which is stiffness in your sort
},
{
    119.16,123.64
     of your knuckles. So when you're doing your buddy taping you want to make sure
},
{
    123.64,127.0
     that you are preserving the movement of the major knuckle sort of through here.
},
{
    127.0,133.0
     So you get your tape and you're pulling off a piece about maybe that long-ish.
},
{
    133.0,139.0
     Again, hand terrible, so if you can, you can just pull it off, flatten that bit off.
},
{
    139.0,145.36
     And what we're looking to do is tape the two fingers together, hence buddy taping.
},
{
    145.36,148.24
     So if you have sprained either your index or your middle finger,
},
{
    148.24,153.68
     the taping is really self-explanatory. You stick the tape over your finger,
},
{
    154.88,161.2
     preserving the knuckle, and then you loop it around itself back to the other side. So you
},
{
    161.2,167.02
     can see I've still got full range of those knuckles, but my fingers are protected together now your second piece of tape
},
{
    168.84,174.12
     Goes around the fingers as well, but this time it actually goes over the end sort of joints to protect it
},
{
    174.12,178.02
     So keeping that middle joint free you're going to loop it over like this
},
{
    178.56,184.88
     Stick it down and you're looking just to wrap it around the finger one and a half to two times for good stability
},
{
    184.96,185.68
     and that is what your sort of and you're looking just to wrap it around the finger one and a half to two times for good stability.
},
{
    185.68,191.84
     And that is what your sort of buddy taping looks like for your index or your middle finger.
},
{
    192.48,198.64
     Now when you are taping for other fingers on the hand, what we're looking to do is make sure we
},
{
    198.64,206.72
     keep the hand as functional as possible. So we're going to take these ones off. Now my preference for taping for the middle finger
},
{
    206.72,211.28
     is to stick it to your index finger. You can stick it to your ring finger but your hand
},
{
    212.56,218.96
     sort of becomes a little bit like claw-like. It's a bit harder to use but if you have sprained your
},
{
    218.96,224.72
     ring finger my preference always is to tape to the middle finger because taping it to the little
},
{
    224.72,225.6
     finger makes your hand a bit useless. So for starters in order to preserve that knuckle My preference always is to tape to the middle finger. Because taping it to the little finger
},
{
    225.6,227.38
     makes your hand a bit useless.
},
{
    227.38,229.76
     So for starters, in order to preserve that knuckle,
},
{
    229.76,231.3
     because of the height difference,
},
{
    231.3,233.56
     you've actually got to come on quite an angle.
},
{
    233.56,235.66
     And then when you get to taping this end of the finger,
},
{
    235.66,236.8
     it's a bit useless.
},
{
    236.8,240.2
     So what you do is, you do the same thing.
},
{
    240.2,243.46
     If we were taping that ring finger too pinky,
},
{
    243.46,245.84
     if you come around, but you've got to bring that tape
},
{
    245.84,249.84
     on a massive angle so you can see that I'm coming off as an angle here, loop it around the hand.
},
{
    251.28,254.64
     Oh I can't even do it now, loop it around the hand, let's stick them together like that.
},
{
    256.0,261.92
     And then for your second piece of tape, when you bring it over the fingers it gets quite tricky
},
{
    261.92,266.0
     because now I'm like that's not my finger anymore and I loop it this way
},
{
    266.84,271.84
     It's also not very secure. So if you've injured your ring finger
},
{
    272.32,275.4
     Taping it to this guy is not going to give it stability and security
},
{
    276.08,279.08
     Whereas if you take your ring finger to your middle finger, they're both quite strong
},
{
    279.64,285.88
     However, if you sprained your little finger, you have no options. This is your taping technique for your pinky finger.
},
{
    285.88,287.52
     Okay?
},
{
    287.52,289.64
     You wanna replace this one a couple of times a day
},
{
    289.64,291.52
     or as you wash your hands
},
{
    291.52,293.76
     because the tape loses its stick
},
{
    293.76,297.36
     and it loses its rigidity, becomes a bit flexible.
},
{
    297.36,299.96
     So you wanna make sure you're keeping it nice and clean.
},
{
    299.96,301.64
     And you can clean and dry between your fingers
},
{
    301.64,303.32
     as well at the same time.
},
{
    303.32,304.16
     Now, as promised,
},
{
    304.16,307.32
     I wanna show you what the taping technique looks like for the middle fingers.
},
{
    307.32,310.44
     I'm going to use the stretchy sort of elastoplast tape.
},
{
    310.44,312.72
     Now because it's got some spring to it,
},
{
    312.72,316.52
     you want to make sure that you're getting enough stability from this tape.
},
{
    316.52,320.0
     If you just loop it on like loosely like I did with the rigid tape,
},
{
    320.0,322.08
     which has very little stretch in it,
},
{
    322.08,325.68
     it's going to have a bit more flexibility than you'd want for this technique.
},
{
    325.68,327.04
     So when you bring it on,
},
{
    327.04,328.5
     you wanna give it a bit of a stretch,
},
{
    328.5,332.26
     just a gentle stretch, maybe about 20 or 30%,
},
{
    332.26,334.74
     so that when it goes on, it's got some recoil
},
{
    334.74,337.66
     and it's got sort of nice firm support on that.
},
{
    338.74,341.48
     Same thing when you're doing the other half,
},
{
    341.48,347.0
     stick it down, give it a bit of a stretch, and then loop it around.
},
{
    347.0,351.6
     Again, one and a half to two times to get that stability. So that is what your
},
{
    351.6,356.8
     little fingers tape together for a buddy taping looks like. Now when we are
},
{
    356.8,361.12
     taping fingers, how tight is too tight? The main thing you're looking for is what
},
{
    361.12,364.6
     we call capillary return. So capillary return, see how my fingertips are quite
},
{
    364.6,368.8
     pink here? If I give this a bit of a squeeze, it blanches, it goes white and then
},
{
    368.8,374.16
     returns quite quickly back to pink. That means that my capillary return in my fingers is quite good.
},
{
    374.8,380.08
     If you have taped your fingers too tight, that capillary return is very, very slow or doesn't
},
{
    380.08,385.2
     happen at all. Or even your fingernails will start to turn a bluish purple colour. If you have that,
},
{
    385.2,390.56
     immediately remove the tape, loosen it all off and start again. Sometimes that can be from the
},
{
    390.56,396.64
     tape itself, it's too tight. Other times it's because your finger is swelling up. So either way,
},
{
    396.64,401.6
     you need blood flow to your fingertips so make sure you unload the. It's absolutely a disclaimer.
},
{
    401.6,405.1
     Now a sprained or strained finger should get better within sort of two to legal disclaimer. Now, a sprained Australian finger should get better
},
{
    405.1,407.1
     within sort of two to four weeks.
},
{
    407.1,409.7
     However, you should get an improvement in that first week.
},
{
    409.7,413.06
     If your finger is not improving in that week,
},
{
    413.06,414.22
     I still want you taping it
},
{
    414.22,416.46
     because if it is something like a small fracture
},
{
    416.46,418.66
     or a little ligament tendon or, you know,
},
{
    418.66,421.9
     tend, ligament or tendon has put a little bit of bone off
},
{
    421.9,424.1
     or you've got a small fracture into your joint,
},
{
    424.1,427.92
     the budding taping is the easiest way to protect it in the short term, but you want to seek
},
{
    427.92,433.36
     appropriate medical advice on how to actually get an x-ray or a scan or further treatment on it
},
{
    433.36,436.8
     because you want to make sure that you're not missing anything that could change your
},
{
    437.52,441.76
     your prognosis with that finger down the track. So that is my buddhi taping technique.
},
{
    442.32,444.8
     Hopefully it's helpful for you guys. Bye.
