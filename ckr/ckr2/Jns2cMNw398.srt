     Hello again, this is Dr. Mix from West Plano Pediatrics.
},
{
    4.64,8.76
     We are talking about how to take a rectal temperature.
},
{
    8.76,10.24
     Lots of parents freak out about this.
},
{
    10.24,12.56
     I promise you, it's not that bad.
},
{
    12.56,15.84
     Okay, fever, again, in reference to our last video,
},
{
    15.84,18.72
     red flags, if your baby is acting really fussy,
},
{
    18.72,21.0
     not feeding well, something is just off
},
{
    21.0,23.48
     and your little spidey sense goes off,
},
{
    23.48,30.48
     take a rectal temperature. Remember again, fever is defined as a hundred point four or greater rectally as
},
{
    30.48,35.64
     ideal at your baby's core temperature. That's Fahrenheit or 38 degrees Celsius.
},
{
    35.64,41.8
     Okay, so we're just gonna kind of do like a little demo here. Just kind of use
},
{
    41.8,45.66
     your imagination a bit. You can use gloves with your baby if you
},
{
    45.66,49.3
     want, you don't have to, but certainly if your baby ever or your child ever has
},
{
    49.3,53.44
     diarrhea, I would definitely recommend using gloves and wiping down surfaces
},
{
    53.44,57.74
     after. That's always a good thing. So here's our little patient, our little
},
{
    57.74,62.7
     cowboy's bear. Okay, cowboys. And here he is. So what we'll do, you lay your baby
},
{
    62.7,65.6
     down on your little changing table or on the floor
},
{
    71.76,79.36
     and all you need this is it like a little digital rectal thermometer. From this one happens to be from CBS. You can go into Walgreens, Target, Walmart, you know Kroger, wherever. Any anywhere has it.
},
{
    79.36,85.16
     So very simple. I think they only cost a few dollars. And then you just have a little button
},
{
    85.16,87.64
     and so it's off right now when I turn it on,
},
{
    87.64,89.92
     it'll go, you know, you can even have different settings.
},
{
    89.92,92.08
     You can put it in Fahrenheit or Celsius.
},
{
    92.08,93.08
     Right now it's measuring low
},
{
    93.08,95.1
     because we're not taking a temperature.
},
{
    95.1,97.92
     So the key is you're going to insert it
},
{
    97.92,100.4
     into where the poo poo comes out, into the child's rectum,
},
{
    100.4,103.0
     until this little silver tip disappears.
},
{
    103.0,105.16
     I promise you, it will not hurt them.
},
{
    105.16,106.56
     They may get a little mad
},
{
    106.56,107.64
     and you need to watch out
},
{
    107.64,109.0
     after you're done taking the temperature.
},
{
    109.0,112.24
     They may have a little explosion after.
},
{
    112.24,114.16
     Okay, this is also another trick
},
{
    114.16,116.6
     that if your baby has a really hard stool,
},
{
    116.6,119.52
     we may instruct you to take a rectal temperature one time
},
{
    119.52,121.2
     to relieve the obstruction.
},
{
    121.2,123.16
     It's not something you should be doing every day.
},
{
    123.16,128.6
     You're only doing this if your pediatrician tells you to or you think your baby has a fever because you don't want
},
{
    128.6,132.72
     them to get dependent on rectal temperatures to have a poo poo. All right, so we got our
},
{
    132.72,139.32
     little guy. He doesn't really have an opening or anything, but this is a little lubricant.
},
{
    139.32,147.36
     You don't need that. You can just use Vaseline, aqua- four, whatever. You just put it very generously on this metal tip, okay?
},
{
    147.36,149.48
     And then you just turn your little thermometer on
},
{
    149.48,152.56
     and then you will insert it like that.
},
{
    152.56,155.4
     So see, you don't see the silver tip anymore.
},
{
    155.4,157.02
     So you can zoom in on that if you want.
},
{
    157.02,158.4
     And I usually just lift up their legs.
},
{
    158.4,160.72
     You can lift up one or both
},
{
    160.72,163.72
     and see our little teddy bear, our little baby is just fine.
},
{
    163.72,168.72
     Doesn't even care, just la la la. And then you wait for a beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, and then you're gonna see
},
{
    168.72,172.88
     what the measurement is. That's it. It might take about a minute and it should beep after that.
},
{
    172.88,177.84
     Okay? If you, if it's not beeping or you get a really low temperature, you probably didn't
},
{
    177.84,186.48
     insert it far enough. So you just need to insert it until that little silver disappears and you get to the blue. Okay well that's
},
{
    186.48,193.32
     then taking a rectal temperature 101. Have a great day. I'm fever free.
