     Hey everyone, I'm Elise, the occupational therapist making stroke information simple.
},
{
    7.12,11.68
     And today I want to talk about one of those invisible issues that people often deal with
},
{
    11.68,13.48
     after stroke.
},
{
    13.48,15.28
     Trouble with memory.
},
{
    15.28,20.32
     This video is specifically for survivors with short-term memory issues impacting function
},
{
    20.32,22.98
     and daily activities.
},
{
    22.98,26.12
     When we have an injury to our brain, this can result in
},
{
    26.12,31.76
     both visible and invisible changes. Just like how some of you might experience
},
{
    31.76,36.16
     one-sided weakness, which is a very visible issue, brain injury can also
},
{
    36.16,41.44
     result in invisible changes like changes to our cognition. And cognition is
},
{
    41.44,45.0
     basically just how we take in information,
},
{
    45.2,48.68
     store it, process it and retrieve it.
},
{
    48.68,52.6
     The first thing I want you to know is that you are not alone.
},
{
    52.6,54.68
     I have worked with many survivors
},
{
    54.68,56.42
     who have dealt with memory issues
},
{
    56.42,58.2
     and changes in cognition.
},
{
    58.2,61.76
     And a 2015 study actually found that two thirds
},
{
    61.76,69.84
     of stroke survivors actually deal with cognitive changes after their first stroke. I'm going to walk you through two different
},
{
    69.84,76.08
     approaches to cognitive rehabilitation. The first approach is remediation.
},
{
    76.08,81.48
     Remediation uses exercises and activities to improve your memory and
},
{
    81.48,86.44
     cognition. The second approach is compensation.
},
{
    87.42,90.78
     Compensation uses techniques and strategies
},
{
    90.78,93.08
     to help you work around memory issues
},
{
    93.08,96.52
     so that you can still do what's important to you.
},
{
    96.52,99.2
     Now, both of these approaches have their merits,
},
{
    99.2,101.6
     and I'd argue that you actually need both of them
},
{
    101.6,103.66
     to improve your overall cognition.
},
{
    104.8,107.12
     Just like in physical rehabilitation,
},
{
    107.12,111.16
     it takes a lot of practice and repetition to improve memory.
},
{
    111.16,114.84
     Neuroplasticity principles apply here too.
},
{
    114.84,118.36
     Try to start thinking of your brain more like a muscle.
},
{
    118.36,120.16
     If you had bicep weakness,
},
{
    120.16,123.96
     you might pick up a dumbbell and start to do some bicep curls.
},
{
    123.96,128.0
     If you're having trouble with memory, you need to practice things that challenge your memory.
},
{
    129.2,135.68
     Let's start with remediation. The first remediation activity is card matching.
},
{
    137.2,142.32
     I like this activity because most of us have an old deck of cards lying around somewhere,
},
{
    142.96,145.22
     although I got these specific matching cards
},
{
    145.22,148.78
     from the Dollar Tree, you may be able to pick one up too.
},
{
    148.78,151.36
     You don't have to use the entire deck,
},
{
    151.36,154.96
     pick anywhere between six to 12 cards to start with
},
{
    154.96,156.74
     and just make sure that they're in pairs.
},
{
    156.74,160.18
     For example, red eights, black jacks, et cetera.
},
{
    161.2,164.14
     Place the cards face down on the table,
},
{
    164.14,166.88
     flip one over and then look for its match.
},
{
    166.88,171.28
     If they don't match, flip them both back over and repeat.
},
{
    171.28,175.32
     The goal with this activity is to work on that memory muscle by having you remember
},
{
    175.32,179.28
     where the card matches are located.
},
{
    179.28,183.96
     The second remediation activity is working puzzles.
},
{
    183.96,186.96
     Some people love them, and some people don't, but
},
{
    186.96,192.56
     puzzles can be a great way to challenge your memory and perception. Pour the
},
{
    192.56,197.48
     pieces out onto the table and set the box up so that you can look at it to give
},
{
    197.48,202.56
     you a reference. You'll have to refer to the picture and remember what it looks
},
{
    202.56,210.56
     like to start setting it up. Then you'll have to remember which pieces fit where.
},
{
    210.56,215.2
     The third remediation activity is meditation.
},
{
    215.2,220.4
     Meditation not only helps us feel more relaxed, less depressed, and connected to our bodies,
},
{
    220.4,224.6
     but researchers have also found that it can actually help increase brain connectivity,
},
{
    224.6,227.44
     which is a huge part of stroke recovery.
},
{
    227.44,230.16
     It might be hard to do when you're first starting out.
},
{
    230.16,234.72
     If you've ever tried to just sit quietly, you'll notice that you can get very distracted
},
{
    234.72,236.88
     by all the thoughts running through your brain.
},
{
    236.88,242.04
     I'd recommend using a free app like Insight Timer or even a paid app like Headspace to
},
{
    242.04,245.12
     help guide you through it.
},
{
    247.76,248.88
     Now let's move on to some compensatory strategies.
},
{
    252.0,253.6
     The first compensatory strategy is to set a reminder.
},
{
    258.64,259.36
     Although I haven't had a brain injury or a stroke, I do struggle with short-term memory issues.
},
{
    266.18,271.26
     I use reminders for everything. I set a recurring reminder for my nightly medication, I set a reminder when I start laundry, and I set a reminder when I'm cooking food and don't
},
{
    271.26,277.08
     want to forget that I have the oven on. My favorite app to use is the Reminders app on
},
{
    277.08,282.48
     my iPhone, which is what I'm showing you in this video. I like using my phone because
},
{
    282.48,288.04
     I always have it with me, but if you're old school, you can use a stopwatch or a kitchen timer.
},
{
    288.04,294.72
     They'll work too.
},
{
    294.72,299.16
     The second compensatory strategy is to make a list.
},
{
    299.16,305.08
     Many of us, myself included, enjoy the act of physically writing out a list.
},
{
    305.08,308.76
     I used to do this all the time when I was writing out my grocery list.
},
{
    308.76,310.84
     But you know what I also did?
},
{
    310.84,313.6
     I lost that list more times than I can count.
},
{
    314.68,318.0
     Using a digital list on your phone, using the notes or
},
{
    318.0,320.92
     reminders app can be really helpful.
},
{
    320.92,324.0
     I'm showing you the notes app on my iPhone in this video.
},
{
    329.44,333.2
     We tend to bring our phones everywhere with us, so if your grocery list is on your phone, you won't forget it.
},
{
    333.2,337.76
     The third compensatory strategy is everything in its place.
},
{
    337.76,342.04
     Make sure that the things you use most often all have their place.
},
{
    342.04,344.96
     Keep your keys in a bowl or hook by the door.
},
{
    344.96,345.32
     Keep your phone in your pocket or hook by the door. Keep your phone
},
{
    345.32,349.52
     in your pocket or plugged in to charge. That way when you go back to look for
},
{
    349.52,354.64
     them you won't have to guess where you left them. Okay everyone that's it for
},
{
    354.64,360.32
     today. I hope you found these exercises and strategies helpful. Let me know what
