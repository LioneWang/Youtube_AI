     Bob and Brad, the two most famous physical therapists
},
{
    6.72,8.04
     on the internet.
},
{
    11.04,12.96
     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.
},
{
    12.96,14.0
     Brad Heineck, physical therapist.
},
{
    14.0,15.76
     Together we are the most famous physical therapists
},
{
    15.76,16.6
     on the internet.
},
{
    16.6,17.44
     In our opinion, of course, Bob.
},
{
    17.44,19.0
     The most humble guys in the world too.
},
{
    19.0,20.12
     That's exactly right.
},
{
    20.12,22.6
     Today we're gonna talk about how to fix elbow pain.
},
{
    22.6,25.22
     We got one simple self-treatment,
},
{
    25.22,26.48
     only takes 90 seconds.
},
{
    26.48,28.28
     We don't have 90 seconds.
},
{
    28.28,30.8
     And it's for both tennis and golfers' elbows.
},
{
    30.8,32.28
     So it doesn't matter which one you have,
},
{
    32.28,33.44
     we're gonna cover them all.
},
{
    33.44,34.8
     The concept is the same,
},
{
    34.8,37.2
     just a little bit different mechanics.
},
{
    37.2,38.48
     And go on Bob.
},
{
    38.48,39.8

     Are we giving away the massager, Mike?
},
{
    47.92,50.6
     Mike says we're giving away the handheld massager, Brad.
},
{
    50.6,52.88
     You can actually use that on tennis level too.
},
{
    52.88,54.88
     Yeah, we could work with that a little bit.
},
{
    54.88,56.72
     We'll maybe show a little bit of that later.
},
{
    56.72,57.68
     Yeah, be careful with that, Bob.
},
{
    57.68,59.36
     Oh yeah, we'll put it down.
},
{
    59.36,60.88
     All right, you can also find the contest
},
{
    60.88,62.48
     pinned to the top page at Facebook,
},
{
    62.48,64.64
     go to Twitter, Instagram, or TikTok.
},
{
    64.64,66.28
     We're actually getting on ZIN too.
},
{
    66.28,70.4
     ZIN, ZIN and the Art of Bicycle Maintenance.
},
{
    70.4,71.68
     All right, Brad, take it away.
},
{
    71.68,74.84
     Okay, so golfer's elbow, tennis elbow,
},
{
    75.68,78.44
     ladder apoconolitis, medial apoconolitis,
},
{
    78.44,82.2
     medically speaking, but it's elbow pain.
},
{
    82.2,85.28
     You know, if you fall and you land on concrete,
},
{
    85.28,87.68
     that elbow pain is completely different.
},
{
    87.68,89.44
     That you need to cold back for.
},
{
    89.44,91.52
     What we're talking about is these elbow pains
},
{
    91.52,94.28
     that come from repetitive motion,
},
{
    94.28,97.88
     or you aggressively go do a task like the other week
},
{
    97.88,101.04
     and I ran the chainsaw for a couple hours.
},
{
    101.04,102.48
     I hardly ever do that.
},
{
    102.48,106.38
     Oh, yeah, I got some elbow pain as a result of that.
},
{
    106.38,111.22
     Well, golf, if you actually like hit the ground really hard,
},
{
    111.22,112.34
     you know, by mistake.
},
{
    112.34,113.18
     You'd never do that.
},
{
    113.18,115.46
     Yeah, that happens a lot.
},
{
    115.46,118.86
     You're really doing a jarring motion to that elbow.
},
{
    118.86,121.82
     So what you're doing is you're tearing some tendons
},
{
    121.82,125.72
     right by the bone and the elbow or the tennis elbow, you know,
},
{
    125.72,128.16
     is on the outside here near this bone
},
{
    128.16,130.36
     and there's typically a really tender spot
},
{
    130.36,131.8
     right where they connect.
},
{
    131.8,135.52
     And golfer's elbow is this the opposite side.
},
{
    135.52,137.16
     There's a tender spot right there.
},
{
    137.16,140.12
     And one thing we should explain is the muscles
},
{
    141.56,143.76
     and the forearm actually attached to that bone.
},
{
    143.76,144.6
     Sure.
},
{
    144.6,147.56
     On this side and the extensor wad, they call it.
},
{
    147.56,149.0
     They attach on this side.
},
{
    149.0,150.88
     So you got muscles all the way along here
},
{
    150.88,152.84
     that are attaching to that bone.
},
{
    152.84,155.44
     Muscles all the way along here, attaching to this bone.
},
{
    155.44,156.84
     So before you do this technique,
},
{
    156.84,158.56
     I know people are gonna say 90 seconds,
},
{
    158.56,159.62
     why do they take 10 minutes?
},
{
    159.62,161.4
     Because we have to explain how to do it properly.
},
{
    161.4,162.72
     Right, you have to understand it.
},
{
    162.72,165.0
     It's not gonna work unless you do it properly.
},
{
    165.0,168.08
     But if I've got tennis elbow, I check here,
},
{
    168.08,169.1
     and I'm gonna go up in here,
},
{
    169.1,171.42
     I'm gonna palpate or feel in these muscles,
},
{
    171.42,173.26
     you're probably gonna find a real tight,
},
{
    173.26,176.64
     knotty, painful muscle group in there.
},
{
    176.64,178.92
     So just assess that, see how tender it is
},
{
    178.92,180.06
     and how tight it is.
},
{
    180.06,182.32
     Same thing, Bob's gonna do the golfer's elbow.
},
{
    182.32,184.9
     So I'm checking on the underside,
},
{
    184.9,187.28
     I guess it'd be of the forearm,
},
{
    187.28,190.6
     already inside, however you wanna coin it.
},
{
    190.6,194.0
     But I'm looking for a tender spots along in here.
},
{
    194.0,197.08
     And you could actually massage that area,
},
{
    197.08,200.88
     but this is much easier and faster than the massage.
},
{
    200.88,203.84
     Now, we're gonna get a really called positional release.
},
{
    203.84,205.12
     It was called strain,
},
{
    205.12,208.98
     counter strain number of years ago, works very well.
},
{
    208.98,210.52
     Now if you've got tennis elbow,
},
{
    210.52,212.36
     this is the mechanics you're going to do.
},
{
    212.36,215.16
     You're gonna, and I do mine, you know,
},
{
    215.16,217.14
     in my recliner I have a pillow.
},
{
    217.14,219.08
     You can do a lying down in bed.
},
{
    219.08,220.76
     Yep, you can do that as well.
},
{
    220.76,223.36
     With the tennis elbow, you're gonna bring your hand
},
{
    223.36,224.2
     back like this.
},
{
    224.2,225.56
     So the elbow is bent. Yep, the elbow're gonna bring your hand back like this. So the elbow is bent.
},
{
    225.56,227.52
     Yep, the elbow is bent.
},
{
    227.52,229.1
     Bring this back like this.
},
{
    229.1,231.12
     And then I'm gonna rotate.
},
{
    231.12,233.0
     If my thumb is pointing towards my face,
},
{
    233.0,234.88
     I'm gonna rotate it away.
},
{
    234.88,236.44
     But you're gonna go back and forth
},
{
    236.44,240.04
     until you find the most comfortable position possible.
},
{
    240.04,242.56
     So you may do a little bit of,
},
{
    242.56,244.36
     this is a general position you're in,
},
{
    244.36,246.36
     but you may do some fine tuning
},
{
    246.36,249.12
     and you'll find it where it feels the most comfortable
},
{
    249.12,250.8
     in that painful spot.
},
{
    250.8,255.04
     And then you're gonna hold it right there for 90 seconds
},
{
    255.04,257.0
     and you're gonna do this when it's nice and quiet
},
{
    257.0,257.84
     and you're relaxed.
},
{
    257.84,259.36
     It's not when the kids are running around,
},
{
    259.36,262.76
     jumping on your lap and that kind of thing for family people.
},
{
    262.76,264.32
     And make sure it's 90 seconds.
},
{
    264.32,265.88
     Yeah, you gotta look at a clock
},
{
    265.88,268.84
     and they always, they say a minimum of 90 seconds,
},
{
    268.84,271.24
     you can go up to 120 seconds.
},
{
    271.24,272.08
     So I'm gonna do that.
},
{
    272.08,273.28
     That would be two minutes.
},
{
    275.08,275.92
     There you go.
},
{
    275.92,277.36
     We got our math down.
},
{
    277.36,279.32
     And then it's important when you're done,
},
{
    279.32,282.12
     let it come off slowly and relax.
},
{
    282.12,284.28
     You're not gonna aggressively stretch it.
},
{
    284.28,286.38
     You're not gonna go work on something. If you're gonna do the golfer's elbow, you're not gonna aggressively stretch it. You're not gonna go work on something.
},
{
    286.38,287.7
     If you're gonna do the golfer's elbow,
},
{
    287.7,289.66
     you're not gonna go golfing afterwards.
},
{
    289.66,292.12
     Yeah, it's actually opposite for the golfer's elbow.
},
{
    292.12,294.96
     So he went this way for tennis elbow.
},
{
    294.96,297.02
     I'm actually gonna go this way.
},
{
    297.02,299.4
     So I got the wrist bent, elbow bent,
},
{
    299.4,301.34
     and now I'm gonna turn it.
},
{
    301.34,303.94
     Also, fingers are going out.
},
{
    303.94,307.4
     Yeah, but again, you're gonna rotate it back and forth
},
{
    307.4,310.8
     and find the most comfortable position.
},
{
    310.8,313.04
     Now I can't relate to this right now
},
{
    313.04,315.68
     because I don't have any tennis elbow or a golfers elbow,
},
{
    315.68,318.24
     but I had some hip pain, Brad did this,
},
{
    318.24,319.72
     and we did this with my hip.
},
{
    319.72,322.28
     And you could tell when I hit the right spot,
},
{
    322.28,323.6
     it was comfortable.
},
{
    323.6,325.48
     It's like, no, that hurts, that hurts.
},
{
    325.48,327.24
     No, that feels good.
},
{
    327.24,331.24
     So you're gonna feel what spot feels the best.
},
{
    331.24,335.36
     And then once I find it, I can actually go down like this.
},
{
    335.36,338.56
     Wherever you have that comfortable feeling,
},
{
    338.56,342.0
     maybe it varies in how your pillow is situated
},
{
    342.0,345.32
     or your injury is, but then you're gonna hold it like that.
},
{
    345.32,350.32
     90 seconds, relaxed, just chill out for 90 seconds.
},
{
    351.96,354.96
     And then when you're done, you open it up slowly.
},
{
    354.96,355.8
     Slowly.
},
{
    355.8,356.64
     Yep.
},
{
    356.64,359.08
     If you wanna do some massage, gentle massage
},
{
    359.08,361.4
     on the muscles afterwards, you can do that,
},
{
    361.4,363.36
     but don't do anything aggressive.
},
{
    363.36,365.6
     Don't go out and like I said, golf again or.
},
{
    365.6,367.72
     And then sort of the massage comes in handy.
},
{
    367.72,370.12
     These handheld massagers are really good
},
{
    370.12,372.88
     for smaller muscles like this.
},
{
    372.88,377.4
     Now also if you're a slightly built person.
},
{
    377.4,379.2
     Thin, you know, don't have a lot of muscle.
},
{
    379.2,380.96
     You probably want to even use this
},
{
    380.96,382.64
     instead of a massage gun.
},
{
    382.64,383.96
     They're very inexpensive.
},
{
    383.96,385.26
     That's what I like about them Brad.
},
{
    385.26,387.98
     And yet they come with five different heads
},
{
    387.98,391.34
     you can put on there and you can work that muscle
},
{
    391.34,393.0
     quite easily.
},
{
    393.0,395.66
     Now be careful, you definitely don't want to go up
},
{
    395.66,396.9
     by that bone where it's tender
},
{
    396.9,400.7
     because that's just going to irritate the living age
},
{
    400.7,401.54
     out of it.
},
{
    401.54,402.38
     You won't be happy with this.
},
{
    402.38,403.78
     You want to keep it in the muscle belly
},
{
    403.78,406.72
     where it feels good and you're getting that,
},
{
    406.72,407.72
     getting that out a little bit.
},
{
    407.72,408.56
     Yeah.
},
{
    408.56,409.4
     I'll do that.
},
{
    409.4,410.24
     I'll take care of your tassel.
},
{
    410.24,411.08
     All right, so very good.
},
{
    411.08,413.76
     Now, the other thing is, as you do that,
},
{
    413.76,415.48
     do it three times a day.
},
{
    415.48,418.16
     I know I didn't even have to do it that often on mine.
},
{
    418.16,419.8
     I didn't have a severe case either time,
},
{
    419.8,422.6
     but it was work so I forgot about it
},
{
    422.6,424.4
     and I forgot to do the next thing.
},
{
    424.4,426.44
     I'm serious, it was a good deal. It held my hip too. I was surprised and I forgot about it and I forgot to do the next thing. I'm serious, it was a good deal.
},
{
    426.44,428.28
     It helped my hip too, I was surprised
},
{
    428.28,430.52
     and I kinda, same thing, I kinda forgot about it.
},
{
    430.52,431.44
     You didn't do it three times a day
},
{
    431.44,432.28
     cause you forgot about it.
},
{
    432.28,433.52
     No, I did it once.
},
{
    433.52,437.96
     And I, you know, I didn't feel it much anymore
},
{
    437.96,439.72
     when I was doing my foam rolling.
},
{
    441.4,442.24
     That's weird.
},
{
    442.24,443.44
     Yeah, I'm amazed.
},
{
    443.44,447.64
     I wish I'd learned this this much earlier in my therapy career
},
{
    447.64,449.36
     because I would use it a lot more patients.
},
{
    449.36,452.16
     So, you know, it's all the way to life
},
{
    452.16,453.76
     kind of falls into place.
