     Bob and Brad, the two most famous physical therapists
},
{
    6.68,8.02
     on the internet.
},
{
    9.72,11.44
     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.
},
{
    11.44,12.56
     Brad Heineck, physical therapist.
},
{
    12.56,14.16
     Because we are the most famous physical therapists
},
{
    14.16,15.0
     on the internet.
},
{
    15.0,16.0
     In our opinion, of course, Bob.
},
{
    16.0,18.06
     We're gonna show you how to heal tennis elbow
},
{
    18.06,19.64
     with self massage.
},
{
    19.64,23.88
     So tennis elbow is also known as lateral epicondylitis.
},
{
    23.88,24.72
     Quite a mouthful, Brad.
},
{
    24.72,26.72
     Yeah, tennis elbows are easier to say. Right, so as lateral epicondylitis. Quite a mouthful. Tennis elbow is easier to say.
},
{
    26.72,29.22
     Right, so the lateral epicondyle,
},
{
    29.22,31.26
     that's that little bump you got here.
},
{
    31.26,33.54
     You got, you know, if you look at the bottom here,
},
{
    33.54,37.46
     you got the elbow and then you got two bumps on either side.
},
{
    37.46,39.38
     This is the bump that's on the outside of the arm
},
{
    39.38,42.5
     as your palms facing flat up towards the ceiling.
},
{
    42.5,45.16
     So what do you have here?
},
{
    45.16,48.48
     Is you have a bunch of muscles here that come along here,
},
{
    48.48,51.24
     narrow up to a tendon and attach to that bone.
},
{
    51.24,52.36
     Right there.
},
{
    52.36,56.46
     So if you overuse this muscle,
},
{
    56.46,58.08
     and there's also some restrictions
},
{
    58.08,60.6
     that possibly could cause this that we're gonna talk about,
},
{
    60.6,64.2
     you can get increased soreness and actually some micro tears.
},
{
    64.2,66.44
     Sure. Tendon or in the muscle itself.
},
{
    66.44,67.8
     So tiny little tears.
},
{
    67.8,68.64
     Tiny little tears.
},
{
    68.64,71.96
     So what we're gonna show you first is the massage.
},
{
    71.96,74.16
     Then we're gonna show you some exercises you can do
},
{
    74.16,77.4
     at the end and we'll tell you why you wanna do those
},
{
    77.4,79.92
     cause they can help prevent it from coming on again
},
{
    79.92,82.24
     or for it to continue to happen.
},
{
    82.24,83.84
     Right, you have some good prevention.
},
{
    83.84,85.48
     Probably need a pillow again, don't we, Brad?
},
{
    85.48,87.56
     Yeah, let's do that.
},
{
    87.56,90.28
     Let's first, we're gonna talk about
},
{
    90.28,92.68
     massage right on the tendon itself.
},
{
    93.76,97.84
     So you'll find, it's tendon, you've had this, Brad.
},
{
    97.84,99.28
     Oh yeah, a number of times.
},
{
    99.28,101.68
     So here's the bump.
},
{
    101.68,103.36
     Usually it's right off the bump.
},
{
    103.36,104.2
     Yep.
},
{
    104.2,105.64
     Towards the hand. And you right off the bump. Yep. Towards the hand.
},
{
    105.64,107.96
     And you'll find the tender spot there
},
{
    107.96,110.18
     and just slightly go over it to start.
},
{
    110.18,112.44
     I put finger over top of finger.
},
{
    112.44,113.8
     Give me a little leverage.
},
{
    113.8,116.56
     Now if it's flared up, I know from experience
},
{
    116.56,118.68
     it doesn't take much, it's very tender.
},
{
    118.68,120.2
     And then you don't wanna go over it.
},
{
    120.2,122.64
     If it really hurts, you're gonna go away from it
},
{
    122.64,124.0
     more towards the muscle.
},
{
    124.0,124.84
     Right.
},
{
    124.84,125.72
     And work away from it. And the muscle and work away from it
},
{
    125.72,127.96
     and then you work your way towards it as it improves.
},
{
    127.96,129.28
     That might take a few days.
},
{
    129.28,130.88
     This is a bad day to be doing this Brad,
},
{
    130.88,131.88
     with your finger.
},
{
    131.88,134.84
     Oh, actually, actually, it's kind of healed up.
},
{
    134.84,136.0
     I won't take that off.
},
{
    136.0,141.0
     All right, so anyway, what the cue here is really looking for
},
{
    141.28,144.76
     is after 30 seconds, if the pain is getting worse,
},
{
    144.76,146.08
     it's too early for this.
},
{
    146.08,148.72
     You're just not allowed to do that yet.
},
{
    148.72,153.88
     So if it is fine after 30 seconds, it gets numb
},
{
    153.88,157.4
     or it's starting to plateau, you can keep doing it.
},
{
    157.4,160.6
     In fact, you could do this for up to 15 minutes,
},
{
    160.6,162.24
     which most of you will not be able to do
},
{
    162.24,163.12
     because it's just too long,
},
{
    163.12,169.18
     but you could do it, spread it throughout the day. Another alternative to this spread would be just doing,
},
{
    169.18,171.66
     this is a McKenzie method here.
},
{
    171.66,174.02
     You actually just put pressure on the tendon
},
{
    174.02,176.34
     and go like this, lift the wrist up.
},
{
    176.34,180.18
     And that's just starting to put some stress on that tendon
},
{
    180.18,183.9
     without putting so much that increases the pain.
},
{
    183.9,186.4
     So it should feel a little bit better with the pressure on?
},
{
    186.4,188.96
     It should feel better, it shouldn't make it worse.
},
{
    188.96,191.36
     And it definitely should make it worse.
},
{
    191.36,192.2
     Sure.
},
{
    192.2,194.52
     It could be plateaued or the same.
},
{
    194.52,198.16
     But if you're too tender to do massage, start with that first.
},
{
    198.16,199.0
     Sure, that makes sense.
},
{
    199.0,202.48
     Go to the massage, and eventually the massage you can do
},
{
    202.48,206.74
     probably every other day for 15 minutes, or like I said, three times a day
},
{
    206.74,207.98
     for five minutes.
},
{
    207.98,210.38
     Brad, do you wanna show how to use a massage gun with your-
},
{
    210.38,211.22
     Sure.
},
{
    211.22,214.5
     Yeah, so if you happen to have a massage gun,
},
{
    214.5,216.82
     you know, one of these big ones is not gonna work.
},
{
    216.82,217.66
     Yeah, that's too much.
},
{
    217.66,218.54
     That's way too much.
},
{
    218.54,221.66
     This one might, but a smaller one,
},
{
    221.66,222.94
     this one may-
},
{
    222.94,224.86
     Yeah, that's a handheld massager.
},
{
    224.86,227.1
     Or, you know, this size really works well
},
{
    227.1,228.2
     for this particular injury.
},
{
    228.2,229.56
     That's the Q2.
},
{
    229.56,230.48
     Yep.
},
{
    230.48,232.96
     And we actually have a video,
},
{
    232.96,235.24
     and we'll mention this at the end too,
},
{
    235.24,239.2
     how to choose the correct massage gun for your pain,
},
{
    239.2,242.56
     or for pain reduction, or for healing,
},
{
    242.56,244.64
     or for muscle recovery.
},
{
    244.64,245.48
     Right.
},
{
    245.48,248.84
     So, with this, you know, you're not gonna get
},
{
    248.84,249.88
     and go straight in and out.
},
{
    249.88,252.48
     Now these travel in and out.
},
{
    252.48,253.44
     Yeah, they percuss.
},
{
    253.44,254.28
     Yep.
},
{
    254.28,256.32
     Oh, that would really hurt on us.
},
{
    256.32,257.16
     Flare it up.
},
{
    257.16,258.12
     So you're gonna actually go down.
},
{
    258.12,260.16
     I would start more in the muscle belly
},
{
    260.16,262.48
     and not straight down in, but at an angle.
},
{
    262.48,265.92
     So we got going across the fibers, which run this way.
},
{
    265.92,267.72
     And then you can work that.
},
{
    267.72,269.36
     And you may find some of these muscles
},
{
    269.36,271.94
     actually get knotted up as a result of this injury.
},
{
    271.94,274.26
     So you want to get those knots out.
},
{
    274.26,276.16
     And, you know, after the longer you do it,
},
{
    276.16,278.4
     you should feel those knots relaxed and release,
},
{
    278.4,281.5
     we call it, and work your way closer
},
{
    281.5,283.82
     to where the injury is at tendon.
},
{
    283.82,285.22
     But it shouldn't get to the point
},
{
    285.22,286.98
     where you're feeling owl pain.
},
{
    286.98,288.98
     You know, it should feel like, oh, it's feeling good.
},
{
    288.98,289.82
     It's feeling relaxed.
},
{
    289.82,290.98
     Kind of a feeling good pain.
},
{
    290.98,291.82
     Yep.
},
{
    291.82,292.66
     Yeah.
},
{
    292.66,295.82
     And that's, you know, pretty much in all cases here,
},
{
    295.82,299.22
     you're gonna wanna work on that extensor wad, they call it.
},
{
    299.22,300.06
     Yeah.
},
{
    300.06,301.46
     That's a wad of muscles there.
},
{
    301.46,302.3
     Yeah.
},
{
    302.3,303.94
     Because they could be tight,
},
{
    303.94,304.78
     and if they're tight,
},
{
    304.78,306.64
     they're gonna pull harder on the tendon.
},
{
    306.64,307.72
     So.
},
{
    307.72,309.76
     Now this gun you could use,
},
{
    309.76,313.32
     but boy, I really think this one would be better.
},
{
    313.32,315.28
     Yeah, and even the different heads,
},
{
    315.28,316.48
     I don't think would work on that.
},
{
    316.48,319.52
     I mean, in that case, it is one of the,
},
{
    319.52,322.8
     you know, you certainly could use it on the muscle belly.
},
{
    322.8,323.64
     Sure. This one.
},
{
    323.64,324.52
     Yeah, right.
},
{
    324.52,326.52
     But on the tendon, I think it'd be too much.
},
{
    326.52,328.64
     Yeah, not working up there.
},
{
    328.64,333.16
     So again, make sure you do the muscle belly.
},
{
    333.16,335.04
     That's gonna loosen up the muscle itself.
},
{
    335.04,338.12
     And then if you can, go over the tendon itself,
},
{
    338.12,340.6
     and that'll start to heal it up, get more blood flow to it,
},
{
    340.6,342.04
     and also break up the scar too.
},
{
    342.04,344.4
     Right, even without an injury,
},
{
    344.4,346.44
     that just, it feels good right now, Bob.
},
{
    346.44,348.68
     You can just tell you've relaxed things.
},
{
    348.68,350.6
     All right, I'm gonna show you a couple of exercises
},
{
    350.6,351.48
     that you can do now,
},
{
    351.48,355.3
     because for what we're finding is that with a lot of people,
},
{
    355.3,358.28
     they're lacking internal rotation at the shoulder.
},
{
    358.28,359.12
     Sure.
},
{
    359.12,360.72
     And so like if you're playing tennis
},
{
    360.72,362.92
     and you're doing a backhand
},
{
    362.92,365.96
     and you don't have enough internal rotation,
},
{
    365.96,368.08
     you're gonna make up that somehow
},
{
    368.08,371.32
     by working the wrist harder and the extensors harder.
},
{
    371.32,372.72
     So you're compensating.
},
{
    372.72,373.76
     You're compensating.
},
{
    373.76,377.48
     So you wanna restore that internal rotation.
},
{
    378.44,381.12
     Brad's gonna first show it, there was a strap,
},
{
    381.12,384.08
     and then if you wanna show it with the Booyah stick too,
},
{
    384.08,384.92
     Brad.
},
{
    384.92,385.24
     So let's say I'm right-handed, so it'd be my right hand more than likely. and then if you want to show it with the bullion stick too Brad. So.
},
{
    385.24,387.48
     Oh, so let's say I'm right handed.
},
{
    387.48,389.8
     So it'd be my right hand more than likely
},
{
    389.8,392.04
     would have that tennis elbow on.
},
{
    392.04,394.0
     I'm not going to play tennis with the
},
{
    394.0,395.92
     my non-dominant side.
},
{
    395.92,397.68
     Now you can do this with a belt.
},
{
    397.68,399.44
     You can just take the loop of the belt
},
{
    399.44,402.28
     or you can take a strap, a stretch out strap
},
{
    403.16,405.32
     and see how he's working,
},
{
    405.32,408.2
     that's actually internally rotating that shoulder.
},
{
    408.2,411.92
     And it's always interesting to compare one side to another.
},
{
    411.92,415.68
     Like you may find that your involved side
},
{
    415.68,418.6
     can only go up this high, whereas uninvolved side
},
{
    418.6,419.44
     can go up that high.
},
{
    419.44,421.16
     And that's an indicator right there that, yeah,
},
{
    421.16,423.48
     you're locking internal rotation.
},
{
    423.48,425.4
     Or you might be lacking on both sides.
},
{
    425.4,428.04
     So you just go pressure on and pressure off
},
{
    428.04,429.36
     or just go up and hold it.
},
{
    429.36,430.72
     But you should not be doing this
},
{
    430.72,432.84
     where it creates any sharp pain anywhere.
},
{
    432.84,434.44
     It should just feel like a stretch,
},
{
    434.44,435.88
     a little stretch pain is okay.
},
{
    435.88,438.44
     I would also recommend that if you have osteoporosis
},
{
    438.44,440.84
     or brittle bones, I wouldn't be doing any of these.
},
{
    440.84,442.32
     Or hypermobile joints.
},
{
    442.32,443.16
     Or hypermobile joints.
},
{
    443.16,445.0
     We don't want to have a dislocation actually. Right, so you can, for all of these. Or hypermobile joints. Hypermobile joints, right. We don't want to have a dislocation actually.
},
{
    445.0,448.88
     Right, so you can, for all of these,
},
{
    448.88,451.6
     I would put out that warning for all of these exercises.
},
{
    451.6,452.64
     Sure.
},
{
    452.64,454.08
     Should we show them with the stick?
},
{
    454.08,455.6
     This is what I do.
},
{
    455.6,457.4
     And this is what I did.
},
{
    457.4,460.0
     Because this made a huge difference for us with it.
},
{
    460.0,463.48
     Brad and I both had an impingement on our shoulder.
},
{
    463.48,466.88
     So the palm goes out here.
},
{
    466.88,468.28
     The painful arm.
},
{
    468.28,469.72
     Well, let's keep it the righty.
},
{
    469.72,471.68
     Cause this would be the painful one.
},
{
    471.68,475.56
     Painful arm, the palm goes out and low.
},
{
    475.56,477.96
     So the back of your hand would be up against your butt
},
{
    477.96,479.8
     and you gotta grab it there.
},
{
    479.8,482.92
     And the palm on the top is facing the head.
},
{
    482.92,483.76
     Yep.
},
{
    485.04,486.76
     Or a head.
},
{
    486.76,488.16
     And then you just work it up.
},
{
    488.16,489.56
     You can work on internal rotation,
},
{
    489.56,491.92
     just like you were with the strap.
},
{
    491.92,493.32
     So we're using the Booyah Stick,
},
{
    493.32,494.76
     which were really well for this,
},
{
    494.76,496.08
     but you don't have to have one.
},
{
    496.08,499.6
     You can use a piece of dialing or a handle from a.
},
{
    499.6,500.44
     A PVC by.
},
{
    500.44,502.68
     Yep, from a, you know, a broom.
},
{
    502.68,503.52
     A broomstick.
},
{
    503.52,504.84
     Yeah, but it needs to be smooth
},
{
    504.84,506.96
     because it slides on your clothing really well.
},
{
    506.96,508.52
     You would want to do this on bare skin
},
{
    508.52,511.68
     because it'll stick and that will be very good.
},
{
    511.68,513.56
     And then we go to the chicken wing.
},
{
    513.56,514.4
     Yep.
},
{
    514.4,517.44
     So on this, I don't go way up.
},
{
    517.44,519.4
     It's already tight, all the tissues are tight.
},
{
    519.4,521.16
     So I keep it down here.
},
{
    521.16,522.0
     And then I-
},
{
    522.0,523.32
     He's leveraging it back.
},
{
    523.32,526.6
     It's really cranking on that internal rotation.
},
{
    526.6,528.8
     Again, no pain though, no sharp pain.
},
{
    528.8,530.4
     Just a stretch feeling.
},
{
    530.4,531.24
     I don't know.
},
{
    531.24,532.56
     I think there's a couple of reasons
},
{
    532.56,533.66
     why this works so well.
},
{
    533.66,536.24
     I think it also kind of puts the scapula up in the right.
},
{
    536.24,537.08
     Sure.
},
{
    537.08,537.92
     But I don't know.
},
{
    537.92,538.74
     Yeah.
},
{
    538.74,540.1
     Well, what do I know?
},
{
    540.1,540.94
     All right.
},
{
    540.94,541.78
     I think you're right Bob though.
},
{
    541.78,544.68
     I just know I've been doing my left one a lot lately
},
{
    544.68,545.98
     and I neglected my right because I don't have the know I've been doing my left one a lot lately and I neglected my right
},
{
    545.98,547.08
     because I don't have the problem here.
},
{
    547.08,549.08
     And now my left one's so loose
},
{
    549.08,550.92
     that I've got to catch up on my right.
},
{
    550.92,553.92
     All right, the other thing is,
},
{
    553.92,557.28
     if you're lacking pronation,
},
{
    557.28,559.4
     or I'm sorry, pronation or supination,
},
{
    559.4,561.36
     you can check this out real easy too, Brad.
},
{
    561.36,563.16
     You put elbows into your side
},
{
    563.16,566.04
     and you might even take a ruler to go across the show
},
{
    566.04,567.92
     because your hand might go like that
},
{
    567.92,570.52
     but the wrist doesn't get a little flat.
},
{
    570.52,572.26
     You wanna get them almost flat.
},
{
    573.32,576.28
     And that'd be both ways, this way and this way.
},
{
    576.28,578.6
     If they aren't and they're lacking,
},
{
    578.6,581.32
     again, your muscles gotta make the difference there
},
{
    581.32,582.72
     and they're gonna be working harder.
},
{
    582.72,584.6
     So it's a real easy stretch to do.
},
{
    584.6,586.48
     First one, all you do is bend your elbow
},
{
    586.48,588.28
     all the way up to flexion.
},
{
    588.28,592.84
     And then you're gonna stretch it into pronation
},
{
    593.76,596.08
     and you're gonna stretch it into supination.
},
{
    597.04,597.96
     10 times.
},
{
    597.96,599.56
     You don't have to remember what's pronation.
},
{
    599.56,600.4
     You know what I'm saying?
},
{
    600.4,601.92
     You don't have to just turn it both ways.
},
{
    601.92,602.76
     Yeah.
},
{
    602.76,605.4
     Turn the faucet on, turn the faucet off, both ways.
},
{
    605.4,607.44
     So you're trying to, you're not grabbing the skin.
},
{
    607.44,609.8
     You actually want to kind of good grip
},
{
    609.8,611.12
     so you're grabbing the bone.
},
{
    611.12,614.32
     Yep, and just gently apply the pressure,
},
{
    614.32,617.22
     but over time, hopefully you're gonna increase the motion.
},
{
    617.22,618.72
     I'm gonna show one more, Brad.
},
{
    618.72,619.56
     With this?
},
{
    619.56,620.4
     The stool.
},
{
    620.4,621.4
     Oh yeah, this one.
},
{
    621.4,624.6
     Yeah, so this is one, it's actually,
},
{
    624.6,625.96
     Mulligan kind of did this,
},
{
    625.96,628.52
     McKenzie did this, these are therapist's terms
},
{
    628.52,630.08
     that people would understand.
},
{
    630.08,631.48
     So you're gonna take your hand,
},
{
    631.48,635.6
     you're gonna actually point the fingers toward yourself.
},
{
    635.6,637.86
     So you're kind of doing a contortionist here.
},
{
    637.86,640.56
     You take the crook of your elbow,
},
{
    640.56,643.6
     go right below the bump here, and you push it.
},
{
    643.6,646.12
     You're gonna actually push this bone out that way,
},
{
    646.12,647.58
     out to the side.
},
{
    647.58,651.0
     One, two, you can do it 10 times.
},
{
    651.0,651.84
     Three.
},
{
    653.16,655.32
     Now believe it or not, that actually,
},
{
    655.32,658.16
     I've had, I had a tennis pro that,
},
{
    658.16,660.32
     not test pro, a golf pro that actually,
},
{
    660.32,661.4
     this took it away for,
},
{
    661.4,663.6
     and she had had it for a long time.
},
{
    663.6,665.16
     And that shouldn't create pain, right?
},
{
    665.16,666.0
     No, no.
},
{
    666.0,667.8
     It should just feel like pain-free.
},
{
    667.8,668.64
     So.
},
{
    668.64,669.76
     Well, your wrists are really,
},
{
    669.76,672.04
     I can't believe how much you can extend your wrist.
},
{
    672.04,673.72
     Well, no, my wrists are tight.
},
{
    673.72,676.8
     No wonder I can't do push-ups without, I mean.
},
{
    676.8,677.64
     Oh, you're pretty close.
},
{
    677.64,678.48
     Oh yeah.
},
{
    678.48,679.92
     Boy, it's really pulling here though.
},
{
    679.92,680.76
     I don't have to work on.
},
{
    680.76,682.6
     You're gonna start working on it, you're using a massage gun.
},
{
    682.6,683.44
     Yeah.
},
{
    683.44,685.8
     So, all right, thanks everybody for watching.
},
{
    685.8,687.6
     Let's mention the program though, Brad.
},
{
    687.6,688.96
     Oh, yes.
},
{
    688.96,693.56
     These videos are part of a series of videos on massage.
},
{
    693.56,696.44
     And if you go to thebobandbrad.com,
},
{
    696.44,698.16
     go to the program section,
},
{
    698.16,701.6
     you'll find the entire program on massage.
},
{
    701.6,703.52
     And it goes over every body part.
},
{
    703.52,707.68
     Right, yep, so you pick out the body part you want to massage,
},
{
    707.68,709.52
     you'll see the title is very clear.
},
{
    709.52,711.68
     Look at that video, get the information
},
{
    711.68,714.76
     and the big bonus is there's a PDF printout
},
{
    714.76,717.9
     which gives a review of the video so you can print it out.
},
{
    717.9,720.84
     You don't have to keep going back to the video
},
{
    720.84,723.48
     and the beauty of it is all for free.
},
{
    723.48,726.88
     We don't ask for email or anything. It just is our gift.
},
