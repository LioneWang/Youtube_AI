     In this video, I'm going to show you how to fix pelvic pain for good. Stay tuned.
},
{
    9.68,14.0
     Hey everyone, Dr. Rowe from SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you're dealing with a lot of
},
{
    14.0,18.24
     pelvic muscle pain and need a quick fix, this is a video that you're not going to want to miss.
},
{
    18.24,22.88
     I'm going to break this up into a very easy two-part guide. In the first part, we're going to focus on
},
{
    22.88,29.66
     getting all of the pelvic floor muscles stretched out with great exercises. So we're really going to target the groin,
},
{
    29.66,33.22
     hip flexors, everything around the pelvis. In the second part, we're going to get rid
},
{
    33.22,38.16
     of pelvic pain for good by strengthening everything so you have a better support system, so you'll
},
{
    38.16,43.14
     hopefully have a lot less instances of pelvic pain in the future. All of these exercises
},
{
    43.14,46.28
     are easy, effective, and can be done in the comfort of your own home.
},
{
    46.28,49.0
     And as a bonus, they don't require any special equipment.
},
{
    49.0,52.0
     So let's get started and get rid of that pelvic pain for good.
},
{
    52.0,55.4
     In the first part, we're going to focus on getting quick pelvic pain relief
},
{
    55.4,57.2
     with great stretching exercises.
},
{
    57.2,59.8
     Let's just get everything moving in and around the pelvis.
},
{
    59.8,62.96
     This is a five-part process called the wall circuit.
},
{
    62.96,65.16
     I'm just going to go next to a wall or a door.
},
{
    65.16,67.96
     I'm going to place my legs flat up against it
},
{
    67.96,71.56
     while my butt is not quite touching the wall or the door.
},
{
    71.56,73.88
     Experiment with different angles, different spacing,
},
{
    73.88,75.64
     and go with what you feel is more challenging
},
{
    75.64,77.32
     yet more effective.
},
{
    77.32,79.24
     So what I'm going to do with my arms
},
{
    79.24,80.64
     is mimic my leg movements.
},
{
    80.64,81.96
     The first one being the scissor.
},
{
    81.96,83.92
     I'm just going to lift one leg straight,
},
{
    83.92,86.88
     make sure it's straight at the knee, while the arm goes back with it. The
},
{
    86.88,90.36
     more that you come backward with that leg, the more intense the stretch is
},
{
    90.36,94.4
     going to be felt into the leg, into the glutes, buttocks, also into the pelvis.
},
{
    94.4,97.66
     You'll also feel the core muscle start to engage. Hold this for about five
},
{
    97.66,101.56
     seconds. You're just going to relax, take a breather, and then repeat it on the
},
{
    101.56,106.36
     other side. You want to do this for nice, slow, controlled movements with each repetition.
},
{
    106.36,109.16
     Challenge yourself to bring it back even further.
},
{
    109.16,112.9
     Try to do this one five to 10 times on each side.
},
{
    112.9,115.08
     From there, what we're going to do is go into a V.
},
{
    115.08,116.36
     So I'm gonna lift both legs up
},
{
    116.36,117.82
     and then I'm going to open the legs up
},
{
    117.82,119.62
     as much as I can like this.
},
{
    119.62,122.04
     You're going to feel this a lot into the groin.
},
{
    122.04,128.88
     You also might feel that one hip is a little bit more stiff so one leg will not go down as far. So really challenge yourself to
},
{
    128.88,132.76
     try to bring those back into balance. Hold this one for five to ten seconds.
},
{
    132.76,136.84
     You're just going to come back up, relax, and then repeat this one three to five
},
{
    136.84,140.8
     times. With each repetition, try to go a little bit further with it to get
},
{
    140.8,144.4
     everything stretched out even more. For the next one, what I'm going to do is
},
{
    144.4,145.56
     just a circular motion.
},
{
    145.56,148.9
     Lift one leg off and do a nice big circle with the foot.
},
{
    148.9,152.22
     It doesn't matter if you go clockwise or counterclockwise
},
{
    152.22,155.22
     because we're just gonna do a slow movement like this
},
{
    155.22,157.22
     with a big circle for five times
},
{
    157.22,159.82
     and then we're gonna switch directions
},
{
    159.82,162.46
     and then do it again five times
},
{
    162.46,164.66
     and then switch to the other side to keep them both
},
{
    164.66,165.68
     in balance.
},
{
    165.68,167.76
     For the next one, what we're going to do is the butterfly.
},
{
    167.76,170.36
     So what I'm going to do is bring my legs down like this,
},
{
    170.36,171.6
     my toes go together
},
{
    171.6,173.72
     and they're going to be touching against the wall.
},
{
    173.72,175.84
     Let's focus on trying to take the knees downwards
},
{
    175.84,177.58
     towards the floor as much as we can.
},
{
    177.58,179.64
     Open the legs up as much as you can.
},
{
    179.64,183.52
     You're gonna feel it really into the inner part of the thigh
},
{
    183.52,185.12
     across the pelvis into the groin.
},
{
    185.12,189.24
     Focus on doing nice slow controlled breathing while doing this. Let the
},
{
    189.24,193.36
     tension out as much as you can. But I like to hold this one for about 20
},
{
    193.36,197.92
     seconds. From there you just relax, take a breather, and then do this one up to five
},
{
    197.92,201.04
     times, each time driving the knees out a little bit further to get a better
},
{
    201.04,204.92
     stretch. In the last one what we're going to do is a simple twist motion. Again, my
},
{
    204.92,207.68
     toes are going to be flat against the wall one, what we're going to do is a simple twist motion. Again, my toes are going to be flat against the wall.
},
{
    207.68,212.88
     What I'm going to do is just take my knees from side to side in a rocking motion, but
},
{
    212.88,217.72
     I want to keep my hips, my bottom as flat as possible during this exercise.
},
{
    217.72,222.34
     When I do this, I usually will get a knuckle crack sensation because we're putting a lot
},
{
    222.34,224.4
     of good movement into the lumbar spine.
},
{
    224.4,229.44
     If you do feel like a pop or a snap, kind of like that knuckle crack sensation because we're putting a lot of good movement into the lumbar spine. So if you do feel like a pop or a snap, kind of like that knuckle crack sensation,
},
{
    229.44,234.0
     that is completely normal. It's just gases being released from the joint. But once we get to one
},
{
    234.0,239.28
     side, hold this for about two to three seconds, you're going to relax, go towards the other side,
},
{
    239.28,245.08
     and then do up to 10 repetitions on both sides. Again, focusing on trying to drive the knees over
},
{
    245.08,247.52
     just a little bit more with each repetition
},
{
    247.52,251.8
     to get a better stretch across the lower back and pelvis.
},
{
    251.8,255.24
     This pelvic stretching exercise is known as a frog rock back
},
{
    255.24,257.48
     and it can be done in bed or on the floor.
},
{
    257.48,260.04
     And yes, it does look a little bit odd.
},
{
    260.04,264.24
     So let's go start off on all fours just like this.
},
{
    264.24,265.86
     What we want is our hips and our knees
},
{
    265.86,266.92
     in a nice straight line.
},
{
    266.92,268.52
     I'm going to bend at my elbows
},
{
    268.52,271.14
     and support my upper body weight just like this.
},
{
    271.14,273.26
     Let's start off with a chin tuck
},
{
    273.26,275.6
     that is just taking the chin towards the chest.
},
{
    275.6,278.82
     From there, what I want to do is then take my knees out
},
{
    278.82,282.4
     to create a V with my knees in a straight line
},
{
    282.4,284.78
     pretty much all the way to the groin itself.
},
{
    284.78,287.84
     The more that you take the knees out like this to create that V, the more
},
{
    287.84,292.0
     intense the stretch is going to be felt into the groin, into the front part of
},
{
    292.0,296.72
     the leg. So only go to your comfort level. Try to put your feet together like
},
{
    296.72,300.84
     this also. What we're going to do next is a rock back. So I'm just going to
},
{
    300.84,304.36
     simply take my butt towards the heels. The more that you rock back, the more
},
{
    304.36,305.96
     intense this stretch is going to get.
},
{
    305.96,308.2
     So only go to your comfort level.
},
{
    308.2,309.94
     Really challenge yourself with this one
},
{
    309.94,311.28
     and get a very good stretch.
},
{
    311.28,315.02
     Once we hit that point, hold this position for 20 seconds.
},
{
    315.02,317.22
     Do nice, slow, controlled breathing too.
},
{
    317.22,319.76
     You really want to focus on letting the tension out
},
{
    319.76,321.14
     as much as you can.
},
{
    321.14,324.7
     When you need to relax, just rock forward, take a breather,
},
{
    324.7,326.24
     and then try to take
},
{
    326.24,331.28
     the knees out just a little bit further on this next repetition, and then rock back even further.
},
{
    331.28,336.08
     You want to do this one nice and slowly for about three to five repetitions. Again, challenging
},
{
    336.08,341.52
     in yourself each repetition to go out just a little bit further. This next stretching exercise
},
{
    341.52,347.5
     is known as a 3D hip flexor, and just like the name implies, it's going to be focusing on the hip flexors, a commonly
},
{
    347.5,349.8
     overlooked area of pelvic pain.
},
{
    349.8,353.2
     We just need a sturdy chair, one without wheels.
},
{
    353.2,356.76
     Let's go up to our chair, put one foot just like this.
},
{
    356.76,358.68
     Knee is going to be bent roughly at 90 degrees.
},
{
    358.68,360.76
     The other leg, let's take it back just a little bit.
},
{
    360.76,362.8
     It's going to be straight at the knee.
},
{
    362.8,367.08
     From there, I take my hands, place it at the hips, have very good upright posture.
},
{
    367.08,369.68
     The first movement is very, very easy.
},
{
    369.68,372.92
     I'm just going to lunge into it with my body weight.
},
{
    372.92,377.2
     The more that I lunge into it, the more intense the stretch is going to feel in the hip flexors
},
{
    377.2,380.32
     of the straight leg, so only go to your comfort level.
},
{
    380.32,389.84
     Once we hit that point, hold this position for about 15 to 20 seconds. You're just going to relax, take a breather, and then repeat this three to five times with
},
{
    389.84,394.64
     each repetition. Go a little bit further with it to try to get a better stretch.
},
{
    394.64,399.28
     If we want to take this one to the next level, what I'm going to do is get back into the stretch,
},
{
    399.28,403.52
     put my arms like this, and then I'm going to rotate towards one side.
},
{
    403.52,407.76
     The more that I rotate, the more it's going to activate those muscles so challenge yourself. You're
},
{
    407.76,412.2
     really going to feel it just stretch a little bit differently. Hold this one for
},
{
    412.2,416.74
     about 15 to 20 seconds. You're just going to relax, take a breather, and then
},
{
    416.74,420.88
     you're going to do it on the other side. You want to do this for about five
},
{
    420.88,426.84
     repetitions on both sides. If we want to take this one to even the next, next level,
},
{
    426.84,429.28
     let's get back into that stress just like this.
},
{
    429.28,431.88
     Put our arms out straight, interlock the knuckles.
},
{
    431.88,434.72
     Let's then go overhead just like this.
},
{
    434.72,437.72
     I'm going to then just bend towards one direction.
},
{
    437.72,440.24
     Use my upper body weight to bend towards one side
},
{
    440.24,441.5
     as much as I can.
},
{
    441.5,443.0
     Again, you're going to feel the muscles
},
{
    443.0,445.62
     get activated just a little bit differently.
},
{
    445.62,448.78
     15 to 20 second hold, and then you're gonna take a breather,
},
{
    448.78,451.84
     and then you're going to repeat it on the other side.
},
{
    451.84,454.02
     You want to do this one and challenge yourself
},
{
    454.02,455.82
     each time to go a little bit further
},
{
    455.82,459.5
     for about three to five repetitions on both sides.
},
{
    459.5,461.98
     One of the best ways to get rid of pelvic pain for good
},
{
    461.98,465.24
     is to strengthen everything in and around the pelvis.
},
{
    465.24,470.48
     This is a three-part wall or door circuit that is going to hit so many muscle groups,
},
{
    470.48,473.6
     the first being the pelvic bridge.
},
{
    473.6,477.08
     I'm going to wear shoes during this because I feel that it gives you a little bit more
},
{
    477.08,479.96
     grip, but you can also do this one barefoot.
},
{
    479.96,484.22
     What I want to do is lay flat on my back, knees bent roughly at 90 degrees.
},
{
    484.22,487.02
     My weight is going to be driven from my heels into the door.
},
{
    487.02,489.62
     What I'm going to do with my arms is just put them off to the side.
},
{
    489.62,491.7
     The first movement, very, very simple.
},
{
    491.7,495.34
     Let's put our weight again from our heels into the door and then just lift the butt
},
{
    495.34,497.06
     up as much as we can.
},
{
    497.06,501.74
     You really want to focus on driving the butt up to the point where it is a nice straight
},
{
    501.74,505.64
     line from the knees to the hips to the shoulders.
},
{
    505.64,510.52
     Once we hit that point, hold this position for about 5 to 10 seconds.
},
{
    510.52,517.24
     You're just going to relax, take a breather, and then repeat this one up to 10 times.
},
{
    517.24,520.92
     Each time, focus on trying to drive the butt up even further.
},
{
    520.92,529.6
     The second part, how we can make this one even more challenging, take one leg off and just bring it back towards you like this almost like a march. It's
},
{
    529.6,533.76
     going to activate the muscles a lot more so again only to your comfort level. You
},
{
    533.76,538.56
     want to hold this one for five to ten seconds, just relax, take a breather and
},
{
    538.56,543.56
     then from there do it on the other side. You can also hold the bridge and do a
},
{
    543.56,545.9
     very slight marching motion
},
{
    545.9,549.76
     like this too if you feel like it's more challenging, but you just want to do it
},
{
    549.76,554.84
     about 10 repetitions on both sides. For the third part what we're going to focus
},
{
    554.84,558.72
     on is what is known as the pigeon pose. Let's get back into our bridge position.
},
{
    558.72,563.4
     Let's take one leg off, bend the knee like this, take the ankle on that side,
},
{
    563.4,566.6
     and place it over the other leg.
},
{
    566.6,571.16
     And then from there, I'm going to take my knee and then push it towards the wall or
},
{
    571.16,572.16
     the door.
},
{
    572.16,575.86
     When you do this, you're going to feel a great stretch into the pelvis, into the hip, but
},
{
    575.86,578.4
     also into the glute and piriformis.
},
{
    578.4,582.34
     Try to hold this position for about 5 to 10 seconds.
},
{
    582.34,587.24
     From there, you're just going to relax, take a breather, and then do it on the other side.
},
{
    587.24,592.24
     You want to do this for about 10 repetitions on both sides.
},
{
    592.6,594.66
     So another great pelvic strengthening exercise
},
{
    594.66,595.92
     is known as the sumo squat.
},
{
    595.92,598.3
     Let's get into a squatting position like this.
},
{
    598.3,600.24
     What I'm going to do is put my weight on my toes.
},
{
    600.24,602.96
     I'm going to drive my elbows into the legs like this,
},

     I should say, into the inner part of the knee
},
{
    604.88,606.78
     and try to drive them out as much as I can.
},
{
    606.78,609.72
     This will intensify a stretch into the inner part of the leg,
},
{
    610.08,614.0
     also into the grant across the pelvis. Once we hit a very comfortable stretch,
},
{
    614.0,620.2
     what I want to do from there is just rock from side to side on my feet, just very very slowly.
},
{
    620.2,626.3
     When you do this, you're going to feel the pelvic muscles really start to fire. Only go to your comfort level.
},
{
    626.3,632.7
     You want to do nice slow movements from side to side for about 10 repetitions on each side.
},
{
    632.7,637.28
     If you do feel like one side is a little bit weaker, throw some more repetitions in there
},
{
    637.28,638.98
     to help strengthen it.
},
{
    638.98,642.38
     From there, what you can do is go forward and backward with your weight because it'll
},
{
    642.38,644.46
     activate the muscles a little bit differently.
},
{
    644.46,647.12
     You can also do a circular hula hoop motion.
},
{
    647.12,648.8
     But focus on trying to drive the knees out
},
{
    648.8,650.0
     as much as you can.
},
{
    650.0,652.98
     Focus on movements that feel just a little bit more weak
},
{
    652.98,654.72
     and throw more repetitions in there
},
{
    654.72,656.16
     to help strengthen the pelvis
},
{
    656.16,659.06
     and hopefully get rid of that pelvic pain for good.
