     Hey guys, Dr. Bo here and I want to give you guys a quick tip on ways to drain
},
{
    7.2,15.24
     your sinuses. Now I know like many of you that the outside pollen, weather, wind,
},
{
    15.24,21.24
     dust, etc. has caused havoc on your sinuses. You guys come into my practice
},
{
    21.24,26.32
     with sinus pressure, pain, headaches, neck pain, you name it. And I wanted to
},
{
    26.32,33.44
     give you my favorite two ways that you can drain your own sinuses at home. Now if you didn't know,
},
{
    33.44,40.72
     your sinuses, your sinus cavities, almost look like a butterfly so to speak. So it starts up here,
},
{
    40.72,46.76
     would come down into underneath your eyes, underneath here, and then out.
},
{
    46.76,54.0
     Now a great way to drain your sinuses is simply to take your thumbs, putting them on the inside
},
{
    54.0,60.2
     portions of your nose, pushing down, and then pushing out.
},
{
    60.2,65.52
     That will help drain some of the sinuses and the sinus cavity underneath your eyes.
},
{
    65.92,69.6
     But my favorite way to drain the frontal sinus,
},
{
    69.6,72.72
     and usually that's the one that's causing you your headaches,
},
{
    73.08,76.92
     is to take your hand simply, the palm of your hand, and here's what you're going to do.
},
{
    77.44,78.8
     I'm going to turn sideways here.
},
{
    79.08,82.08
     You're going to take the palm of your hand and you're going to aim right in
},
{
    82.08,89.18
     between the eyebrows here and you're going to push not only in but you're going to push up at the same time. So
},
{
    89.18,92.82
     you're going to push into the sinus cavity, you're going to press up and then
},
{
    92.82,98.02
     extend your head into extension. And what you want to do is you want to hold
},
{
    98.02,103.18
     that extended position for about 15 to 20 seconds. With your head in an
},
{
    103.18,106.2
     extension position what it does is it actually helps
},
{
    106.2,112.6
     to open up and to drain the sinuses. The sinuses will drain down the portion of your neck,
},
{
    112.6,117.12
     down into your left superclavicular area, and then clean out the rest of your body.
},
{
    117.12,123.08
     So the two tips to help drain your sinus cavities, number one, use your thumbs by pressing in
},
{
    123.08,130.0
     and out. And number two, taking your palm of your hand, pushing up underneath, in between the eyebrows of
},
{
    130.0,135.24
     your head and extension and pushing up on the forehead here. Give that a try and
},
{
    135.24,140.4
     let me know what you think. Like I said, I know that the wind, the seasonal
},
{
    140.4,147.96
     allergies, everything's going crazy, but please use those two tips and let's see if we can't help drain your sinuses
},
{
    147.96,150.16
     and help you fight all of those allergies.

{
