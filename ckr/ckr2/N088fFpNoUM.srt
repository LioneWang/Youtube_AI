     Welcome back everyone. Today I'm going to show you some rehab exercises for meniscus
},
{
    4.68,9.0
     tears or meniscus injuries. A lot of times these tears can occur from
},
{
    9.0,13.28
     aggressively stopping and twisting and rotating your knee, normally seen in a
},
{
    13.28,19.24
     netball, football or basketball. If you do have a knee injury it tends to swell up
},
{
    19.24,23.56
     or get stiff or you might hear some popping noises or it gets stuck in a
},
{
    23.56,28.64
     position unable to lock out. If you do have these symptoms, please see a health professional first before trying
},
{
    28.64,35.04
     these exercises. Now, these exercises that I'll be showing you can reduce some pain or
},
{
    35.04,39.68
     prevent a lot of the injuries in the future by strengthening up the knee. Some people
},
{
    39.68,49.08
     have even reported that these exercises has helped them opt out of surgery so not needing surgery as well. So I hope these exercises helped you as much as they
},
{
    49.08,50.72
     helped me and my patients.
},
{
    50.72,56.44
     Tests for meniscus tears. To help you confirm it is a meniscus tear or ligament
},
{
    56.44,62.16
     strain on the knee, I recommend placing your knee in a slightly bent position and
},
{
    62.16,66.0
     rub your thumb over the knee joint line in a firm and
},
{
    66.0,72.16
     controlled manner. Try to feel for any warmth or swelling, unusual alignment compared to the other
},
{
    72.16,79.04
     knee or knee pain. Just take your time to investigate. High pivoting and agility sports put a lot of
},
{
    79.04,86.16
     stress and strain on these knees structures. If there is no pain, try moving your knees straight and then into a
},
{
    86.16,91.84
     bent position again back and forth. Then try to move in a more circular movement left to right.
},
{
    93.12,97.6
     If your knee locks and it does not allow you to straighten again or if there's any pain,
},
{
    98.32,103.6
     you may have a tear or something causing a wedge in the knee joint. If you have any of these issues,
},
{
    104.24,105.96
     there's a high chance you have an injury.
},
{
    105.96,110.52
     I recommend you see a health professional before trying videos or exercises on the internet.
},
{
    110.52,119.36
     Hip adduction. Lay on your side with your top leg slightly behind you to give you some balance and your arm supporting your neck.
},
{
    119.36,128.16
     Now raise your leg with your knee extended and then back down. By being in a stable position, you can concentrate on working on the right muscles.
},
{
    128.88,133.36
     Do about 10 to 20 raises on both sides, 3 to 4 sets.
},
{
    133.36,138.8
     If you find this exercise too easy or too light, just place an ankle weight onto yourself.
},
{
    138.8,143.52
     I'll leave a link in the description box below on where to get them, but please be careful.
},
{
    144.16,146.0
     As this can add a lot of stress on your knee,
},
{
    146.0,151.56
     so start doing the exercises without the weights first. This exercise works on the main hip adductors,
},
{
    151.56,159.16
     which brings your hip inwards, such as the adductor magnus. These muscles are very important to
},
{
    159.16,163.28
     stabilize the hip and the pubic bone. Sometimes when you have an imbalance with these muscles,
},
{
    163.28,169.12
     it can cause issues in your knee and the pubic synthesis. Some athletes even develop arthritis in the groin.
},
{
    169.84,175.84
     Hip abduction. Lay on your side with your bottom leg bent to give you more balance
},
{
    175.84,182.0
     and the upper leg straight. Now raise your leg up and down in a controlled manner. Do 10 to 20
},
{
    182.0,188.32
     raises on both sides three to four sets. You can support your head with the other hand that's on the bottom.
},
{
    188.32,192.06
     And with the other hand, you can add some stability by placing it on the floor.
},
{
    192.06,195.6
     This will allow you to activate the right muscles and instead of worrying about falling
},
{
    195.6,196.6
     over.
},
{
    196.6,201.2
     This exercise will work on the glute medius and minimus muscles, which is the muscles
},
{
    201.2,202.88
     that are on the side of your hip.
},
{
    202.88,207.2
     This muscle plays a major role in knee stability, walking and running efficiency.
},
{
    207.2,213.36
     If you find this exercise too easy or light, you can place an ankle weight onto yourself.
},
{
    213.36,217.52
     Once again, please be careful as this can add a lot of stress on your knee, so start
},
{
    217.52,220.2
     with doing the exercises without the weights first.
},
{
    220.2,224.32
     Hip muscles play a big role in the knee stability and foot placement.
},
{
    224.32,229.8
     As you can see, when I squeezed the inner thigh muscles together, aka the hip adductors,
},
{
    229.8,231.32
     my knees get pulled in.
},
{
    231.32,237.04
     This adds a lot of pressure on the inner knee ligaments and the outer knee meniscus.
},
{
    237.04,242.64
     It also rolls my foot inwards, so by having overly strong tight hip adductors, you can
},
{
    242.64,246.12
     cause foot pain and knee pain, which may even
},
{
    246.12,250.52
     increase the possibilities of injuries in the future or poor running technique.
},
{
    250.52,255.44
     This can be avoided by having proper strength in your hip abductors, which
},
{
    255.44,258.66
     pulls the knees slightly outwards preventing knocked knees. But if your
},
{
    258.66,262.16
     knees are pulled out too much, it can cause some stress on the outer knee
},
{
    262.16,265.44
     ligaments and the inner knee meniscus.
},
{
    265.44,270.72
     Therefore, we need to have a well balanced tug of war between the inner and outer hip muscles.
},
{
    270.72,274.48
     In most people, we tend to have weaker outer hip muscles.
},
{
    275.2,280.32
     So if you're unsure, just work on your outer hip muscles, which is hip abduction.
},
{
    281.04,283.04
     Hamstring heel digs.
},
{
    283.04,286.72
     Lay on your back, bend your knees and dig your heels into the floor.
},
{
    286.72,291.88
     Then slightly pull your heels towards your bum. Just enough so your heels almost sliding towards
},
{
    291.88,300.2
     yourself and your bum is almost off the floor. Hold this isometric contraction for 20 to 30 seconds.
},
{
    300.2,306.16
     Have a rest for about a minute and then repeat the exercise again 3-4 times.
},
{
    306.16,310.48
     This will contract the muscle behind the thighs, which is the hamstrings. The hamstrings
},
{
    310.48,316.36
     cross the knee joint and is crucial for knee flexion, running and walking.
},
{
    316.36,318.24
     TOW SLITES
},
{
    318.24,322.84
     Training the hamstrings at home may be quite challenging. We need to get quite creative,
},
{
    322.84,326.0
     especially if fancy equipment is expensive.
},
{
    326.0,327.38
     To work on the hamstrings,
},
{
    327.38,329.86
     get a towel and lay it on a smooth surface
},
{
    329.86,332.36
     where the towel can slide easily.
},
{
    332.36,334.24
     Dig your heels into it
},
{
    334.24,336.2
     and your back flat against the floor.
},
{
    336.2,337.68
     Now slide the towel away
},
{
    337.68,340.1
     to a point where you can still pull it back
},
{
    340.1,341.22
     towards your bum.
},
{
    341.22,343.04
     Press your heels onto the floor
},
{
    343.04,344.48
     to the point where your back
},
{
    344.48,345.12
     is almost lifting off the floor to the point where your back is almost
},
{
    345.12,351.44
     lifting off the floor and then perform the sliding movement. Do about 8 to 15 repetitions
},
{
    352.08,359.52
     for 3 to 4 sets. I found this exercise extremely difficult and my hamstrings were burning afterwards
},
{
    360.4,365.6
     so I highly recommend doing the exercise only if you're fully recovered from your injury
},
{
    365.6,368.98
     and you just want to strengthen your hamstrings.
},
{
    368.98,373.96
     Hamstring Curls Have a rolled up towel and place it just above
},
{
    373.96,377.84
     your knee while laying on your stomach on the floor.
},
{
    377.84,381.4
     By having your knee elevated on the towel, it will protect the knee you're trying to
},
{
    381.4,388.96
     rehab from unnecessary rubbing on the floor. Whilst supporting yourself with your elbows and your other leg touching the floor,
},
{
    389.68,394.32
     raise the back of your heel towards your bum and then back down again slowly.
},
{
    394.96,400.4
     Do 10 to 20 repetitions and do this on both sides 3 to 4 sets.
},
{
    401.04,407.4
     If you find this exercise too easy, you can add ankle weights to your leg. I want
},
{
    407.4,412.68
     you to consciously squeeze and activate the muscles in the back of your thigh, the hamstring
},
{
    412.68,420.36
     muscle on each movement. Remember, you are the boss here, and you are in control.
},
{
    420.36,426.8
     In 2015, a Journal of Physical Therapy Rehabilitation published a paper on the effect of exercise
},
{
    426.8,434.12
     therapy compared to arthroscopic surgery on middle aged patients with degenerative meniscus
},
{
    434.12,435.76
     tears.
},
{
    435.76,441.2
     After the 12 week exercise program, there was significant improvement in isoconetic quadriceps
},
{
    441.2,447.92
     strength immediately after the program, Compared to treatment with surgery.
},
{
    447.92,449.72
     Step ups.
},
{
    449.72,452.56
     You can do this exercise at home on some stairs
},
{
    452.56,455.6
     or a stack of phone books pressed up against the wall
},
{
    455.6,457.52
     so they don't move.
},
{
    457.52,460.2
     Here I am using a humble foot stall.
},
{
    460.2,462.56
     Simply step on one foot at a time,
},
{
    462.56,465.16
     then back down again in controlled manner.
},
{
    465.16,468.36
     Please concentrate on the two phases of the movement.
},
{
    468.36,470.2
     Up and down.
},
{
    470.2,475.08
     Do this for 10 repetitions and repeat it on both sides 3-4 sets.
},
{
    475.08,480.2
     On that phase, the muscles around the knee contracts, especially the quadriceps.
},
{
    480.2,485.0
     We want to work more on the VMO muscles here, because it's very important for knee strength
},
{
    485.0,486.6
     and patella tracking.
},
{
    486.6,493.18
     As you step down, I want you to do this slowly as possible, to allow eccentric contraction.
},
{
    493.18,497.04
     This is a phase where the muscle is lengthening under load.
},
{
    497.04,501.68
     This will strengthen your muscles for forces that lengthens it, which will prevent you
},
{
    501.68,504.04
     from injuries in the future.
},
{
    504.04,505.04
     Side step ups.
},
{
    505.04,509.24
     Get yourself a stall, the lower the step, the easier it is.
},
{
    509.24,511.64
     The higher the step, the harder it is.
},
{
    511.64,516.4
     Now step on the stall and then back down again in a slow and controlled manner.
},
{
    516.4,521.16
     Do 10 repetitions and repeat it on both sides 3-4 sets.
},
{
    521.16,529.52
     This exercise will mainly work on the quadricep muscles but this variation in particular will give you some strength, confidence and control again on moving side
},
{
    529.52,535.08
     to side. It will also slightly work on the inner thigh muscles and the outer hip muscles
},
{
    535.08,537.4
     such as the glute medius and the glute minimus.
},
{
    537.4,541.96
