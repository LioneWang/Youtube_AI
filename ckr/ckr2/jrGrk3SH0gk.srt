     Hi, I'm Dr. Tom McClellan.
},
{
    11.16,13.96
     One issue you would example today of a Jackson Pratt drain.
},
{
    13.96,15.48
     JP drains are very important.
},
{
    15.48,17.8
     I use them a lot in my practice.
},
{
    17.8,23.16
     This will be remedial for the med students and the physicians, viewers of the channel,
},
{
    23.16,29.84
     but it's really important for my patients and other patients out there that want to understand a JP drain, specifically how
},
{
    29.84,34.8
     it works and what are some of the important features about the drain. So
},
{
    34.8,37.8
     I'll show you an example of that today and I greatly appreciate you watching.
},
{
    37.8,41.76
     Obviously email if you have any questions or leave a comment and thank you
},
{
    41.76,45.58
     for watching. The drain comes in a couple parts.
},
{
    45.58,52.24
     Here you can see a graduated bulb which will serve to store the fluid.
},
{
    52.24,56.54
     It has a small connector where you can attach it to your dressing.
},
{
    56.54,57.54
     Here's the tubing.
},
{
    57.54,61.74
     There's a sharp point which the surgeon will use to take it through your skin.
},
{
    61.74,65.44
     So from the pocket it needs to be drained to the outside.
},
{
    73.44,77.12
     And then on the business end of the drain is a perforated tubing with the black marked meaning five centimeters outside the wound and ten centimeters outside the wound. So you note
},
{
    77.12,85.56
     approximately where the the distal, I'm sorry the most proximal hole is. So if I attach the drain to the collection reservoir,
},
{
    87.48,89.2
     this is what it's gonna look like.
},
{
    89.2,91.2
     And I'll take my coffee cup full of water
},
{
    91.2,93.44
     and I'll add some coloring to it.
},
{
    93.44,95.74
     This happens to be some crystal light.
},
{
    100.6,103.76
     And I'll place the drain into the coffee cup.
},
{
    103.76,106.84
     And as you can see, I'm going to put the top on I see many
},
{
    106.84,111.56
     Patients that show up to my office with drains that look like this and as you can see
},
{
    112.0,119.76
     No draining is occurring when the cap is on and there is no compression of the actual bulb itself
},
{
    120.04,124.32
     So now I'm going to compress the bulb this generates the vacuum and then I'll put the top on
},
{
    124.6,127.8
     While the the collection reservoir is still compressed.
},
{
    128.6,137.0
     And as you'll notice when I let go of the drain it creates a vacuum and starts to remove the fluid slowly from the coffee cup.
},
{
    140.2,145.4
     And what we'll do here is as it starts to fill up with the fluid and it's the patient
},
{
    145.4,149.36
     is home on a certain day, when it reaches a certain level and you need to empty it a
},
{
    149.36,157.44
     couple times a day, you'll simply hold the bulb and you'll pop the top off.
},
{
    157.44,162.12
     In general you will give the patient a cup to measure in the amount and cc's that comes
},
{
    162.12,165.84
     out. You'll pop the top off, you'll gently
},
{
    165.84,173.84
     drain out the fluid that's on the inside, and you'll record the amount that comes
},
{
    173.84,178.36
     out on a sheet, much like this one that I give to my patients, generally twice a
},
{
    178.36,185.44
     day from each JP drain. Then after you record it, you compress the bulb and you simply put the top back on.
},
{
    185.44,190.72
     And this recharges the reservoir to remove the fluid.
},
