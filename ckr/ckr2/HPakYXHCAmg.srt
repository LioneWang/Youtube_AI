     Hi, if your sense of smell is not very good because you've had a blocked nose or just
},
{
    14.2,19.2
     not breathed through your nose for some time, then at very little cost and effort you can
},
{
    19.2,23.56
     try smell training, also called olfactory training.
},
{
    23.56,25.72
     This video is based on research studies
},
{
    25.72,31.56
     by Professor Thomas Hummel in 2009 and a follow-up study by Dr. Zara Patel in
},
{
    31.56,40.72
     2017. You'll need four essential oils rose, lemon, cloves and eucalyptus. These
},
{
    40.72,46.0
     can be bought from any source they don't need to be any particular make or quality.
},
{
    46.0,55.0
     Each oil should be sniffed for 10 to 15 seconds and I'd recommend that you sniff with each nostril separately.
},
{
    55.0,67.28
     When I started this, with my right nostril I could smell a little, but I couldn't smell anything through my left nostril. Within four weeks, my left nostril improved substantially
},
{
    67.28,69.28
     and the right nostril also improved.
},
{
    70.24,73.6
     So you sniff each oil in turn,
},
{
    73.6,76.64
     little sniffs rather than one big one,
},
{
    76.64,79.12
     and leave a gap of around 15 seconds
},
{
    79.12,81.38
     before you sniff the next one.
},
{
    81.38,84.04
     In fact, by the time you've put the top back
},
{
    84.04,85.08
     on the one you've smelt, picked up the next one. In fact by the time you've put the top back on the one you've smelt
},
{
    85.08,91.84
     picked up the next one, shaken it, unscrewed it, 15 seconds has passed. So the
},
{
    91.84,96.64
     whole thing takes just a couple of minutes. There's no particular order so I
},
{
    96.64,113.52
     suggest just picking them at random. Okay.
},
{
    115.52,116.32
     Okay, rose.
},
{
    179.0,186.68
     If you can't smell very much at all then just try to imagine the smell. Lemon, nice. Personally I find this is quite a weak smell. I don't really need to test it on the right side anymore. Eucalyptus. I find this so strong now on the right side that it's unpleasant so I mostly only smell this one through my left nostril. How often should I practice?
},
{
    186.68,189.5
     In the studies, people were asked to practice twice a day
},
{
    189.5,192.76
     for 12 weeks, but there's no reason why you shouldn't do
},
{
    192.76,195.64
     this more often or continue for longer.
},
{
    195.64,198.64
     Also, I think it's a good idea if you have a few moments
},
{
    198.64,200.94
     while you're boiling the kettle in the kitchen
},
{
    200.94,206.24
     to sniff coffee or black pepper or vanilla or nutmeg, anything that will
},
{
    206.24,212.68
     encourage your smell neurons to start working. Why these smells? Professor
},
{
    212.68,217.2
     Hummel chose scents to represent four types of smell based on a classification
},
{
    217.2,230.32
     of odors sometimes called an odour prism. For floury he chose rose, for fruity, lemon, for spicy, cloves and resinous eucalyptus.
},
{
    231.84,238.16
     Does it work? With a poor sense of smell most people notice improvements within a week,
},
{
    238.16,243.84
     I certainly did. With a complete loss of smell and not the results are not so good.
},
{
    246.08,254.08
     with a complete loss of smell and nose may the results are not so good. Professor Hummel's study was on people with a complete loss of smell and 30% showed improvement after 12 weeks. Dr Zara

{
    254.08,260.96
     Patel's was also on people with complete loss of smell and 32% experienced some improvement after
},
{
    260.96,265.72
     12 weeks. Improvement was seen in people who had suffered
},
{
    265.72,271.16
     smell loss due to respiratory infection, head trauma and where the reason wasn't
},
{
    271.16,278.28
     known. Smell training involves neurons growing and that's a very very slow
},
{
    278.28,283.36
     process so don't give up. Having an improved sense of smell really does
},
{
    283.36,293.0
     improve quality of life. I found food tastes better and there's an additional joy to life when you smell something new or something you haven't smelled for a long time.
},
{
    294.0,302.0
     The improvement I noticed encouraged me to look further and now I've added a few more oils into my training set.
},
{
    305.48,310.72
     into my training set. If you've completely lost your sensor smell I suggest you try a YouTube video by an ENT doctor. They suggest to use jars rather than
},
{
    310.72,317.76
     sniffing directly from the bottles and refrigerating the oils. But I found when
},
{
    317.76,322.56
     I'm really just improving my sensor smell that is much easier to have the oils
},
{
    322.56,325.28
     on your bedside table and in fact it's quite
},
{
    325.28,332.48
     pleasant to start and end the day with smell testing. Dawn Goldworm is an internationally

{
    332.48,339.68
     recognised olfactive expert and she said your nose is like a muscle in the body that can be

     strengthened by giving it a daily workout not with weights but with sniffs. Okay bye for now.
