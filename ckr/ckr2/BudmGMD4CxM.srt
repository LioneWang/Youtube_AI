     Hey everybody, it's Doctor Jo and Brian. He's gonna be my model today to show you
},
{
    6.0,11.12
     the special test which is the nearest test to test for a positive shoulder
},
{
    11.12,18.0
     impingement. So let's get started. Disclamer alert, disclaimer alert.
},
{
    18.2,27.26
     So with the nearest test... Is there a far's test? Maybe. We're testing for shoulder impingement but again
},
{
    27.26,31.38
     like a lot of these special tests there are some false positives and there's some
},
{
    31.38,36.38
     false negatives. So if there's positive which usually means pain it doesn't
},
{
    36.38,40.24
     necessarily mean that it's an impingement it could be impingement it could be
},
{
    40.24,44.3
     tenonitis, bursitis, there could be a tear in there somewhere so just take this
},
{
    44.3,48.64
     as it is so you're narrowing it down. So for the nearest test, I'm gonna
},
{
    48.64,53.0
     put my hand kind of on his shoulder here. He's gonna be completely relaxed. I'm
},
{
    53.0,58.24
     doing all the movement for this. So I'm gonna take his arm and I'm gonna medial
},
{
    58.24,63.08
     rotate or internally rotate. I like internally rotate but people use
},
{
    63.08,68.58
     different terminology. So I'm gonna internally rotate his arm and he's kind of relaxed and so he doesn't know
},
{
    68.58,72.66
     what I'm gonna do and I'm just gonna forcefully take it up that way and so if
},
{
    72.66,79.5
     he gets a painful look on his face that's a positive sign.
},
{
    79.5,84.74
     So it could be impingement or it could be some other stuff but usually I don't
},
{
    84.74,87.96
     tell people that I'm taking it up because you don't want them to help
},
{
    87.96,88.96
     you.
},
{
    88.96,89.96
     You really just want to take it up on your own.
},
{
    89.96,91.96
     But you can say, I'm going to hold you here.
},
{
    91.96,93.72
     I'm going to move your arm around a little bit.
},
{
    93.72,95.84
     You just turn it in and take it up.
},
{
    95.84,97.16
     So that's the test.
},
{
    97.16,100.34
     But again, just remember it could be a couple other things.
},
{
    100.34,101.96
     This is just narrowing it down.
},
{
    101.96,104.68
     But this is to test for impingement.
},
{
    104.68,110.0
     So if you are positive for this test, we've got some stretches and exercises that will
},
{
    110.0,111.0
     hopefully help that out.
