    16.96,23.32
     the body. Patients with rheumatic diseases tend to have a lot of muscle tension, especially

{
    23.32,27.74
     when trying to cope with the daily joint stiffness and pain.

     This next exercise, known as progressive muscle relaxation, involves purposely tensing and
},
{
    33.82,39.42
     relaxing different muscles so you can more easily identify the difference between feeling
},
{
    39.42,42.82
     tense and feeling relaxed.
},
{
    42.82,47.0
     Just like the first exercise, the end goal here is to feel less stressed.
},
{
    47.0,54.0
     Also, it's important to note that you should not engage in any of these exercises if you have pain
},
{
    54.0,61.0
     in different parts of the body or distress or limitations. You should not be in any discomfort
},
{
    61.0,66.12
     while doing these exercises, so please feel free to modify or eliminate
},
{
    66.12,69.32
     any of the strategies as you see fit.
},
{
    69.32,71.5
     Let's practice.
},
{
    71.5,76.5
     Again, find a comfortable place to either sit or lie down.
},
{
    76.56,81.56
     You can begin by taking a few deep relaxing breaths.
},
{
    82.72,85.68
     Let's begin by bringing attention to your feet.
},
{
    87.12,93.64
     Curl your toes in tightly to feel the tensing muscles of the foot of both feet.
},
{
    95.04,101.08
     Hold this for a few moments before releasing the tension and relaxing the feet.
},
{
    101.76,103.76
     Do you notice the difference?
},
{
    103.96,111.96
     relaxing the feet. Do you notice the difference? Noticing the difference between a tense and relaxed muscle is the purpose of this exercise.
},
{
    111.96,118.0
     Now we're going to repeat this relaxation exercise with different parts of the body.
},
{
    118.0,126.56
     Now point your feet down, pointing the toes down toward the floor, feeling the tension in your calf muscles.
},
{
    126.56,135.92
     Hold that for a few moments and release. Once again noticing that change from
},
{
    135.92,149.52
     moments of tension and moments of relaxation. Now bringing attention to the thigh muscles, point the toes upward toward the ceiling,
},
{
    149.52,155.52
     feeling the tension in the large muscles of the thighs.
},
{
    155.52,164.96
     Hold that for a few moments and when you're ready, begin to release.
},
{
    164.96,169.78
     Now bring attention to the buttocks. Tightening the muscles of
},
{
    169.78,176.46
     the buttocks as you sit or lie on the floor. Once again holding this for a few
},
{
    176.46,190.6
     moments and gently relaxing. Bringing attention to the belly, to the muscles of the abdomen,
},
{
    190.6,196.68
     and tensing these muscles as if you're bringing your belly button in, pushing
},
{
    196.68,207.36
     your belly button in toward the spine, and holding here for a moment and gently relaxing.
},
{
    210.8,218.96
     Noticing the back and here just gently arching the lower back and seeing if you can feel
},
{
    218.96,224.48
     the tension along the muscles in the back as you arch the back.
},
{
    225.0,226.24
     along the muscles in the back as you arch the back.
},
{
    228.5,230.1
     Hold for a moment or two,
},
{
    233.78,235.8
     and then slowly release.
},
{
    238.08,241.18
     Working our way up to the shoulders, a place where we tend to hold a lot of tension,
},
{
    242.0,244.76
     bringing your shoulders up towards your ears,
},
{
    244.76,245.92
     squeezing them up,
},
{
    245.92,257.28
     holding them for a moment, and slowly and gently releasing the shoulders. Now
},
{
    257.28,265.0
     focusing on the hands, making the hands into a fist and squeezing tightly.
},
{
    265.0,272.0
     Hold it another moment and slowly release.
},
{
    274.0,276.0
     Now working up to the arms.
},
{
    276.0,280.0
     You can just gently keep the fists if you like
},
{
    280.0,284.0
     and bring the lower arms towards the upper arms.
},
{
    284.0,288.28
     Pulling the forearms up towards the upper arms,
},
{
    288.28,291.02
     tightening the biceps,
},
{
    291.02,295.82
     and slowly releasing.
},
{
    295.82,300.56
     And finally, bringing attention to the face and the mouth.
},
{
    300.56,304.48
     Here, we're going to squeeze our eyes tight,
},
{
    304.48,305.8
     holding them shut tight,
},
{
    305.8,317.28
     pursing the lips, holding for a moment and slowly relaxing.
},
{
    317.28,327.92
     Once you have tense and relaxed all of these muscles. Notice how your body feels. Allow yourself to feel
},
{
    327.92,None
     totally relaxed as you sit or lie here. You can do this exercise daily. If you have time, for a more extensive relaxation exercise.
