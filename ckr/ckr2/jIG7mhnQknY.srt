     In this video, I'm going to discuss wound measurement and wound staging.
},
{
    10.8,15.24
     Wound measurements are important to monitor the progression of your patient's wound week
},
{
    15.24,16.24
     to week.
},
{
    16.24,19.76
     They're also important when you order supplies for your patients.
},
{
    19.76,24.4
     Getting a correct wound measurement helps your supply company get the correct dressing
},
{
    24.4,25.84
     for that patient.
},
{
    25.84,30.9
     Also, Medicare and other insurance companies go directly by your wound measurements in
},
{
    30.9,36.0
     order to determine the type and size of dressing to send out to your clients.
},
{
    36.0,40.56
     First off, when you're measuring your wound, you want to remember to measure length, width,
},
{
    40.56,42.32
     and depth.
},
{
    42.32,47.76
     First of all, your length is head to toe always and the width is side to
},
{
    47.76,51.44
     side transverse. So you're going to envision a clock. The head of your
},
{
    51.44,57.6
     patient is 12 o'clock, toes are 6 o'clock and on the foot you want to
},
{
    57.6,61.6
     think of your patient is standing on their toes. The tip of the toes is 6 o'clock
},
{
    61.6,70.78
     and the heel is 12 o'clock. You're going to take your wound ruler and go head to toe from the longest point and
},
{
    70.78,72.26
     document that number.
},
{
    72.26,78.98
     Then you'll measure the width, which is side to side, three to nine.
},
{
    78.98,83.04
     And depth, to measure the depth you'll go to the deepest portion of the wound.
},
{
    83.04,91.08
     You'll take your cotton tipped applicator, you can either use a wooden or some already come with measurement on them.
},
{
    91.08,97.24
     So you go softly to the deepest portion of the wound, place your forefinger in your thumb
},
{
    97.24,101.04
     at the wound edge and then withdraw the q-tip.
},
{
    101.04,106.56
     And you'll take your measuring device and go from the end of the swab to where your
},
{
    106.56,109.92
     fingers meet and that will be your depth.
},
{
    109.92,114.84
     You also want to note on pressure ulcers only the staging.
},
{
    114.84,119.16
     There are four stages of wounds, stage one, two, three and four.
},
{
    119.16,126.88
     There's also an unclassifiable or an unstageable wound and a deep tissue injury.
},
{
    126.88,129.84
     Stage one is an early pressure ulcer.
},
{
    129.84,131.48
     There will be no broken skin.
},
{
    131.48,136.0
     You'll just have a red area that's non-blanchable over a bony prominence.
},
{
    136.0,141.92
     Stage two ulcer is a partial thickness ulcer that may start out as a fluid-filled blister
},
{
    141.92,143.88
     over a bony prominence also.
},
{
    143.88,145.84
     There will be no slough in the wound base and
},
{
    145.84,154.56
     usually no depth. A stage 3 ulcer is a full thickness. These wounds may have slough or
},
{
    154.56,162.68
     granulation tissue or both. They can also have eschar. A stage 4 is the deepest type of a
},
{
    162.68,169.88
     pressure ulcer and these ulcers will have bone or tendon present and visible in the wound base.
},
{
    169.88,173.0
     They will also have sluff and eschar.
},
{
    173.0,178.64
     A deep tissue injury will present as a fluid filled blister, but the fluid will be more
},
{
    178.64,182.6
     like a bruise, like a blood, and they're not open.
},
{
    182.6,187.92
     They may at a later time open on up and be a very deep pressure ulcer,
},
{
    187.92,191.2
     but that's how they will present as a deep tissue injury.
},
{
    191.2,193.2
     Sometimes you cannot stage your ulcer.
},
{
    193.2,195.8
     If your ulcer is covered with eschar completely
},
{
    195.8,197.24
     or covered with slough completely
},
{
    197.24,199.18
     and you can't see the wound base,
},
{
    199.18,201.36
     then you would document that as an unstageable
},
{
    201.36,204.84
     pressure ulcer until the doctor debrides that wound
},
{
    204.84,205.92
     and you can see the base,
},
{
    205.92,210.72
     you're unable to know if there's bone or tendon present. If you have any further questions about
},
{
    210.72,218.24
     wound staging or wound measurement, please contact Advanced Tissue on their website or by phone.
