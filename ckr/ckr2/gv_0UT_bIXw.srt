     Bob and Brad the two most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    9.24,14.72
     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist, Brad Heineck physical therapist, together with the most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    14.72,21.7
     In our opinion of course Bob, ten best exercises for osteoporosis or weak bones, right so what are they Bob?
},
{
    22.0,24.0
     What is what?
},
{
    24.96,29.04
     Okay, we do have some good exercises now with osteoporosis
},
{
    29.64,33.72
     Typically we're gonna gear this for someone that's over 50 years old
},
{
    34.76,36.76
     Usually it's females statistically
},
{
    37.36,44.16
     It's affected females because after they go through menopause their hormonal system changes and their bones do not
},
{
    44.74,46.2
     Excerpt calcium like they should like they used to and so go through menopause, their hormonal system changes and their bones do not exerb calcium.
},
{
    46.2,47.04
     Like they should.
},
{
    47.04,48.96
     Like they used to.
},
{
    48.96,53.48
     And so in that case, the doctors will advise,
},
{
    53.48,56.52
     get some exercise, some weight-bearing exercise
},
{
    56.52,58.52
     and more calcium in your diet.
},
{
    58.52,60.8
     Not really high impact though for most people.
},
{
    60.8,62.48
     Well, that's a good point Bob.
},
{
    62.48,67.24
     It's one of those things depending on the severity of how weak the bones are,
},
{
    67.24,70.04
     as well as the person's history,
},
{
    70.04,72.48
     have they been active in the past?
},
{
    72.48,73.98
     Is that what they like to do?
},
{
    73.98,77.24
     But usually we're not gonna start out with running.
},
{
    77.24,78.36
     You know, that's a pretty high impact.
},
{
    78.36,81.36
     First off, we certainly want people to be safe.
},
{
    81.36,83.08
     First off, we don't wanna have the exercise
},
{
    83.08,84.68
     cause a broken bone.
},
{
    84.68,89.52
     Right, exactly. I mean, safety comes first with all these to make sure you know your limits and
},
{
    90.44,93.52
     Secondly because I did see a thing Brad and I know you don't have this listed
},
{
    93.52,98.98
     But this was kind of one of the new things is they were having people do hopping. Sure
},
{
    98.98,105.54
     Which is amazing to me. How you hop can be a difference between a medium impact or high impact
},
{
    105.54,109.22
     So are you gonna land on your heels? Are you gonna keep that cushion?
},
{
    109.22,110.08
     Yeah cushion, right
},
{
    110.08,114.02
     Your calf muscles and the ankles so we'll get into that in just a little bit as well
},
{
    114.02,117.46
     By the way Brad in case you have just wandered in to our channel
},
{
    117.46,119.46
     Well look at that Bob, the cow is growing
},
{
    119.98,122.76
     We want you to take a second to subscribe to us

{
    134.12,138.92
     Facebook and like us if you'd like to be liked. Alright Brad, what's the first one?
},
{
    138.92,142.36
     Okay walking just simply going out and walking
},
{
    142.36,145.72
     Now it's a good universal universal exercise. You got weight bearing
},
{
    145.72,148.2
     You're using a lot of muscle strut the legs and the hips
},
{
    148.64,152.94
     So from the hips on down you're gonna help increase that bone density
},
{
    153.96,157.0
     If you haven't walked in the past and you started walking program
},
{
    157.0,162.88
     I don't advise going out and walking two miles all at once. Yeah, it's always a progression that you want to start off
},
{
    162.88,168.12
     Start out with rounded block. You know every week add another 5 or 10 percent
},
{
    168.12,173.32
     That's pretty conservative, but you know build it up so over a period of a couple months
},
{
    173.32,175.72
     You're from one or two blocks up to that mile mark
},
{
    175.72,177.1
     You're gonna stay out of trouble that way
},
{
    177.1,180.6
     Exactly so walking can be great a treadmill no problem with a treadmill
},
{
    180.6,182.28
     Yeah, just be careful with it
},
{
    182.28,187.2
     Make sure that you have the emergency switch to your hip because people can if you haven't used it before
},
{
    187.36,191.0
     If you walk off and you're not paying attention you're watching TV
},
{
    191.0,194.4
     You end up going off the end of the treadmill and you can break some bones
},
{
    194.4,196.6
     You can see playing this on YouTube if you look for it
},
{
    196.6,203.56
     Oh, yeah, or if you I've done this a lot where you walk and you put your foot on the not moving part and you stumble there
},
{
    203.56,207.58
     So treadmills is a big caution if you're not used to them and if you're
},
{
    207.92,213.82
     walking is not stable, maybe stay away from those. Okay next things simple
},
{
    214.62,219.46
     Grab a chair at home and we're gonna do some squats. Let me do them Brad. Go ahead
},
{
    219.86,223.34
     So you can do it, you can do them behind it to hold on to it
},
{
    223.34,229.36
     But what's nice is if the chair is right behind you because then in case you do go too far and you lose your balance
},
{
    229.36,230.36
     You just go right into the chair
},
{
    230.36,236.04
     Now some people have knee pain so when you get down so far if your knees hurt then those muscles will not energize as well
},
{
    236.04,238.88
     Or you know that could be a potential for a fall
},
{
    238.98,250.08
     So you know what's nice about these two Brad when you first start off you can use your arms Sure, so you're weak you can go ahead just start using your arms and you can go back up and down like this
},
{
    250.32,254.8
     Usually we try to keep the knee so that it doesn't go past the foot
},
{
    254.8,260.34
     So as you can see here, we try to go, we don't like to go that, that puts a lot of pressure on the knee
},
{
    260.64,264.12
     So we try to do these where you kind of come somewhat straight up
},
{
    264.68,265.2
     But eventually as you get better you might want to go with one arm the knee so we try to do these where you kind of come somewhat straight up but
},
{
    265.2,268.88
     eventually as you get better you might want to go with one arm and
},
{
    268.88,272.18
     eventually you may want to go put your arms across your chest even like this
},
{
    272.18,277.16
     right so not only are you working some bone getting some bone density but you're
},
{
    277.16,281.48
     strengthening the hips and the legs. This is really a great exercise for balance.
},
{
    281.48,287.8
     Stay right there once because the next step stay standing instead of going off the chair let's just do squats. Okay. The chair is
},
{
    287.8,292.36
     behind you. Oh sure leave it there. So you get tired you can sit but you're just
},
{
    292.36,295.94
     gonna use a chair for balance or if this is the kitchen sink you can grab your
},
{
    295.94,299.36
     fingers right around the sink. I'm gonna put some weight on there in case Bob gets
},
{
    299.36,304.52
     a little carried away. What's nice about this is it's a real functional thing
},
{
    304.52,306.68
     too I mean that's how you want to pick things up
},
{
    306.68,312.52
     Is you want to bend your knees like this and he's trying to keep us straight back too. Do it incorrectly once Bob
},
{
    312.52,315.8
     Yeah, that's what you want to avoid you want to stay up tall
},
{
    316.24,320.96
     Keeping your head up while you're doing the squats and you can do these very shallow if you start off with it
},
{
    320.96,326.02
     Especially if you're getting knee pain a lot of times you do a shallow squat and it won't hurt as much
},
{
    326.02,331.76
     If you don't go as far into the knee even little shallow squats like this are better than not doing them at all
},
{
    331.76,335.48
     Exactly that's gonna help you with getting up and down steps as well
},
{
    335.98,340.74
     Okay, let's go to the next one. Well another one way to do it Brad is to use the ball on the wall
},
{
    340.74,347.0
     The ball on the wall, this is one of my favorites, this is for someone who's a little more stable and more
},
{
    347.0,350.56
     Brad you have grippy shoes right? I don't have grippy shoes
},
{
    350.56,355.3
     You gotta have shoes or if you're on carpet so your feet don't slide out because you'll slide out
},
{
    355.3,359.5
     You want to bring your feet out away from you a little bit, good shoulder width wide and
},
{
    359.8,365.8
     Lean right up against there and do a squat but don't get down so far that you can't get up
},
{
    365.8,368.56
     Because I'm gonna have to stay like this for, can you help me Bob?
},
{
    368.56,372.16
     I'm just kidding, but it really makes a big difference when you get too far down
},
{
    372.72,376.96
     Sometimes you could have a chair and again shallow ones are fine. I mean you can do shallow
},
{
    376.96,383.44
     Yeah, exactly. My wife and I both do these and she likes what she does is when she's warming up in the morning
},
{
    383.44,385.04
     She'll do off a set of 20 and she'll go do in the morning she'll do off a set of 20
},
{
    385.04,387.56
     And she'll go do something else and she'll do another set of 20
},
{
    387.56,389.56
     She just throws them in there
},
{
    389.56,395.02
     As far as repetitions I would start out with a set of 10 probably and as you get stronger you can go up to 20
},
{
    395.76,399.24
     Usually that's as far as I recommend. I suppose you could do more. I do 30
},
{
    399.24,401.74
     Bob's a higher repetition person
},
{
    403.2,405.34
     That's when it starts to burn Exactly This is an easy one
},
{
    405.9,408.9
     Hold on the chair and just do some high marching
},
{
    409.4,411.4
     And this is a little more
},
{
    411.9,415.32
     Exerting than it looks like if I do this for a couple minutes
},
{
    415.32,420.26
     I'm starting to get tired and if you haven't done this before particularly if you're you know if you're a little older
},
{
    420.26,425.28
     You do 20 of these
},
{
    425.52,432.1
     You're gonna sit down you're gonna take a rest. Sure. So again that 10 to 20 repetition. Okay, this next one I
},
{
    433.04,436.02
     Like to have something for balance particularly to start out with it
},
{
    436.02,442.42
     It's just lunging where you go forward and it might only be this far and then don't bring your knee way forward
},
{
    442.42,447.26
     Again, so the knee should not go past the front of the foot
},
{
    447.26,451.54
     Right. When you get to that point then you just you're dipping down. Yeah
},
{
    451.54,457.78
     Yeah, people have trouble with this one Brad. It takes a bit to get used to this one. It really works the quadricep muscles
},
{
    457.78,463.12
     Good posture, so we're not doing this. This is what we want to avoid in all cases up tall
},
{
    463.48,467.08
     Working that posture and then I like to alternate like this
},
{
    467.8,473.32
     Okay, so you get both, and as you get stronger you can go a little wider and a little deeper
},
{
    473.32,477.28
     But believe me do not make the mistake of
},
{
    477.68,482.94
     Starting out like this and trying to go down and touch your knee because chances are you're not gonna get up unless you're really strong
},
{
    483.24,486.56
     That works both of the legs and you might tumble and have a fall.
},
{
    487.64,489.64
     Okay, side lunging, huh?
},
{
    490.44,492.44
     I like doing the side movements
},
{
    493.0,494.24
     because
},
{
    494.24,497.6
     it gets those hip abductors working a little bit and that's a real
},
{
    498.36,501.96
     important muscle for stabilization for falls. You need good strong hips
},
{
    501.96,505.76
     So you can just walk across the floor like this and I will see
},
{
    505.76,510.96
     you later I'm coming back don't worry and you know these can start out small if these are too easy
},
{
    510.96,515.36
     at the end of this we've got some exercises some a way to modify it to make it stronger to make it
},
{
    515.36,524.16
     a little more difficult so steps now I wouldn't recommend using a step like this Bob right I would
},
{
    524.16,526.86
     go to your stairway in the house where you have some handrails
},
{
    526.86,533.06
     At least one if you have two handrails even better and then you can just start up and back down
},
{
    533.34,537.62
     You know if you want to do one leg at a time and just do step ups like that
},
{
    537.96,540.78
     You can do that working both legs 10 at a time
},
{
    542.18,544.18
     Or you can alternate it like this
},
{
    547.2,547.76
     And it gives you something more to think about
},
{
    551.44,551.76
     And you know in life don't pass up the opportunities to walk upstairs
},
{
    555.76,556.0
     Right, don't take the escalator
},
{
    561.12,561.68
     If there's some stairs do the stairs, exactly, you want to incorporate this into your life, right
},
{
    562.72,567.28
     Absolutely My wife always gets a kick that people use the elevator to work and they're all younger
},
{
    567.28,572.0
     And just use the steps, you know, because talking about losing weight and that kind of thing
},
{
    572.0,576.04
     So yeah, just a good way to a quick way throughout the day to spread it out
},
{
    576.04,579.04
     I want to throw one in for the upper extremities
},
{
    579.04,584.3
     Actually two of them in and this is the push-ups get some weight right through the arms
},
{
    584.36,586.2
     You can start out on the wall
},
{
    586.7,588.7
     You know if you haven't done push-ups
},
{
    588.82,593.74
     But you know your arms are real weak you can do 10 or 20 of them that way as I get stronger
},
{
    593.74,597.38
     You can go to a cupboard like here, but the plinth is in the way
},
{
    597.54,600.92
     Sure, so we're gonna have to go out to here and this is harder
},
{
    601.58,606.24
     Than the wall push-up. Yeah, it's not near as hard as a real push-up
},
{
    606.24,612.6
     Yeah, so you don't have to lay down on the ground and do a regular GI push-up. I think these are good options
},
{
    612.6,619.52
     Sure. All right, then shall we finish off with the advanced? Yeah, let's go a couple of advanced ones
},
{
    619.64,625.58
     So for advanced you do need the Thera tubing. Yeah, he's getting some exercise tubing with handles
},
{
    625.58,630.46
     Right and the handles are really handy and what we're gonna do is just step on it like this
},
{
    631.48,636.66
     Bring them up to here and now you're gonna have pretty good balance. You've already done the other exercises
},
{
    637.26,642.16
     We're gonna do the squat down. So let's give it a little resistance to the squat. Exactly. Let's go sideways
},
{
    642.42,644.26
     So we're not doing this
},
{
    644.26,646.08
     Good posture. Down
},
{
    647.04,652.0
     here and we might as well throw the arms in. There we go like that. That's the beauty of the
},
{
    652.0,662.08
     fair band. Down and up. Yeah get some music going. Get going. You can do some dancing. Get a little
},
{
    662.08,667.48
     hip movement in there. Little rocky. All right Brad you got one more to show, don't forget the last one
},
{
    667.48,671.88
     This one is not so much weight bearing but I think it's really good for the hips
},
{
    671.88,675.36
     Which is gonna help your balance and give you a stable walk
},
{
    675.36,680.52
     Get some weight bearing to them, yep there is, not quite as aggressive
},
{
    680.52,683.02
     But you will feel it right where my fingers are pointing
},
{
    683.68,685.16
     Have you done this Bob lately?
},
{
    685.16,690.16
     No, I haven't done this one. Give it a whirl, it's fun. I know this one you are getting a little
},
{
    691.64,696.4
     Making the muscles work a little harder, which means that usually that is good for the bones. Yeah, so
},
{
    696.64,702.82
     So this is focusing on those hip bones and the hips are often times the source of fracture when people fall
},
{
    702.96,706.64
     So that's another reason why this one's important helps take away that risk factor
},
{
    706.64,714.56
     Yeah, so remember to you know eat your calcium and drink your milk and all those things that are gonna give your bone density and
},
{
    714.56,720.64
     Do these exercises I would say not seven days a week five days a week is what I like to say take two days out
},
{
    721.2,None
     Exactly, all right thanks everybody for watching
},
