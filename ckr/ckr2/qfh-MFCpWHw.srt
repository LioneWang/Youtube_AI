     Bob and Brad the two most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    10.8,14.76
     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist Brad Heineck physical therapist, together
},
{
    14.76,19.22
     We are the most famous physical therapists on the internet, in our opinion of course Bob Brad you look like a zebra
},
{
    20.32,27.46
     Multicolor zebra, this is good information today, we're gonna bestow it upon you today. We're gonna talk about sciatic leg pain
},
{
    28.12,32.5
     It reveals the pinched nerve and how to release it now, right?
},
{
    32.5,40.06
     Yeah, so we're gonna people always comment, they have their MRI shows L3 or L4 pinched nerve
},
{
    40.06,44.68
     And we're just gonna give you some information how you can kind of diagnose that without an MRI
},
{
    44.68,49.6
     Right, you can tell where the pain is and by where the pain is sometimes you can tell where the problem is
},
{
    49.6,53.52
     And then we're gonna show you how to treat it. Yep, if you are new to our channel

     Also, we've got some big news big day big day Brad. Oh, yeah, I'm Facebook. What day is it?
},
{
    66.22,71.98
     It's for the next two weeks. We're having a contest basically we're giving away a free
},
{
    72.6,76.92
     mattress. Yeah, and it's a good quality mattress. This is a high-end mattress and boy
},
{
    76.92,78.92
     you're gonna want to get in on this and it's so easy to
},
{

    88.18,94.2
     Give us some nice comments. The comment could be short just say you like Bob and Brad. Bob and Brad right there
},
{
    94.2,100.36
     That's where it is on Facebook. So this is 2018 if you're watching this video some time from now
},
{
    100.36,109.56
     August 16th through the August 30th is when the contest starts and even if you don't go to the page because they're gonna have some deals there
},
{
    109.56,114.72
     Sure, all right, so sciatica, sciatica is referring to a pinched nerve
},
{
    115.64,119.24
     Somewhere in the back it could be in the pier of the pharmacy, but it runs down the leg
},
{
    119.72,121.04
     Typically one leg
},
{
    121.04,129.56
     We're gonna talk about there's instances where it might be both legs sure but where you feel the pain in your leg you got this you got my leg in
},
{
    129.56,133.1
     there Bob mentioned we're talking about maybe I should have had this tattooed
},
{
    133.1,136.66
     on my leg. Right if he was really to make the sacrifice for the channel he
},
{
    136.66,140.3
     should have had this tattooed on there. I'm gonna work on that. We're looking at
},
{
    140.3,145.26
     you know how dedicated are you?, well I felt pretty dedicated doing this Bob
},
{
    146.0,147.6
     One way or another
},
{
    147.6,154.0
     Where you feel the pain now if you feel like pain numbness tingling and it feels like it's radiating
},
{
    154.16,157.56
     Right up your thigh, more in your thigh, right? It's funny
},
{
    157.56,160.28
     I just got somebody on Facebook that asked me about this. Oh really? Yeah
},
{
    160.28,165.28
     Yeah, that's not uncommon to have that kind of a sensation or pain in that location
},
{
    165.28,168.6
     That would refer to a L3 nerve root
},
{
    168.6,169.44
     Right, okay
},
{
    169.44,174.74
     This is all mapped out and here if we're gonna look at L3 actually on this particular model
},
{
    174.74,176.74
     Can you zoom in on Sam?
},
{
    176.74,178.74
     So we got the lumbar vertebrae
},
{
    179.56,188.98
     Five bones that stack up to make your back back the lower three we got one two three That's L3 right below it is the nerve rut for L3
},
{
    188.98,195.48
     And that means something's happening there it could be that there is a bulging disc
},
{
    195.96,200.84
     Interfering with that or herniated disc and you look there is one there. Oh my gosh. Here we go
},
{
    201.84,204.6
     But there's something else we're gonna go through the other
},
{
    201.88,204.56
     Here we go But there's something else we're gonna go through the other
},
{
    205.56,210.02
     nerve root first, so that would be relate to this area of the leg
},
{
    210.02,214.66
     Now if you've got pain that kind of comes on the side and goes across the knee
},
{
    215.04,218.5
     down onto the inside part of the leg into the
},
{
    219.12,222.22
     medial or the inside ankle bone there
},
{
    222.84,224.84
     That is four
},
{
    228.64,234.88
     inside the ankle bone there. That is four, L4 so that would be the nerve root right below. No these can vary a little bit from person to person and I don't know even from the leg maybe.
},
{
    235.44,241.44
     But you might even have just parts of it. You might have pain just right here or you might just
},
{
    241.44,245.0
     have pain right here. It seems like you're on that nerve rut.
},
{
    245.0,251.5
     I've had people have no pain here, but then down here they have pain or numbness or tingling.
},
{
    251.5,254.6
     So it doesn't mean it follows the complete nerve path.
},
{
    254.6,259.0
     But this is why it's a practice for us.
},
{
    259.0,263.0
     But it's given you a generalization of you can kind of start guessing.
},
{
    263.0,265.48
     That might be between L4 and L5
},
{
    266.0,271.3
     So and the last one Brad is the red one down here L5
},
{
    271.3,278.84
     And that's on the outside of the calf and it kind of goes across and it eventually goes up to the great toe
},
{
    278.84,282.62
     The big toe. That's the one I had Brad. That's the one that gave me trouble
},
{
    282.62,285.12
     And this is the one I have problems
},
{
    285.12,286.56
     I still do it today
},
{
    286.56,291.28
     But there's two big reasons not the only reason but two common reasons you can get
},
{
    291.88,296.76
     sciatica that we're going to talk about is one a disc problem or herniated disc like we talked about before
},
{
    296.76,299.96
     Herniated or bulging disc or you could have stenosis
},
{
    300.12,303.5
     Right which means that instead of a disc
},
{
    305.64,309.56
     which means that instead of a disc interfering with the nerve, there's actually the the frame and where the nerve comes out, the little hole that the
},
{
    309.56,314.64
     nerve comes out has gotten shrunk up for some reason. Right, it could be from the
},
{
    314.64,320.28
     disc shrinking over time and age, which is my case. Could be arthritis.
},
{
    320.28,328.52
     There could be some bone spurs There's a number of different things but either way it could be stenosis
},
{
    328.52,333.76
     Now we're gonna generalize here the big picture if it's a bulging disc
},
{
    333.76,339.08
     Oftentimes it gets worse with prolonged sitting, you'll get that leg pain
},
{
    339.08,350.16
     Anytime you're putting that back in that rounded out posture or bending forward, bending forward slouching, poor posture with standing or sitting with poor posture
},
{
    350.16,355.2
     it's worse. So we're going to show you a couple options to help treat that
},
{
    355.2,362.56
     so we get Sam out of the way. So the problem is this makes it worse so we're
},
{
    362.56,368.26
     going to take it in the opposite direction We're gonna go into extension so and we've done extensive videos on this
},
{
    368.8,372.46
     And we're only gonna touch on it today right correct Brad
},
{
    372.48,377.66
     We're just gonna go going again. You know if you have that L3 L4 L5 you can try some of this
},
{
    377.66,379.16
     You can get up on your elbows first
},
{
    379.16,384.72
     We're starting to bend the back in the opposite direction and now you can go ahead and eventually work up to
},
{
    382.5,384.56
     to bend the back in the opposite direction. And now you can go ahead and eventually work up
},
{
    384.56,386.76
     to doing some press ups.
},
{
    386.76,390.24
     So I got my hands below my shoulders and I'm pressing up.
},
{
    390.24,393.2
     And what we're looking for is that the symptoms,
},
{
    393.2,394.56
     first off, don't get worse.
},
{
    394.56,396.12
     Right.
},
{
    396.12,399.0
     And secondly, maybe even start to feel a little bit better.
},
{
    399.0,401.92
     You might have a little bit less tingling or numbness
},
{
    401.92,406.0
     or pain down in the lower part of your leg.
},
{
    406.0,407.0
     Right.
},
{
    407.0,410.64
     And I mean the ideal situation is that it starts taking it out of the leg completely.
},
{
    410.64,411.64
     Right.
},
{
    411.64,413.76
     And maybe you feel a little bit more in the back.
},
{
    413.76,414.76
     Yeah.
},
{
    414.76,415.96
     But it's going out of the leg.
},
{
    415.96,420.4
     The worst that, you know, the farther it's going down the leg the worse it's getting.
},
{
    420.4,421.4
     Right.
},
{
    421.4,425.32
     And we have a number, if you go to our playlist we have a lot of sciatic
},
{
    429.2,429.8
     videos that go through this in much more detail. If you go to our
},
{
    434.46,438.92
     favorite products, we have a book section, the Kinsey books, they're only about ten dollars. They go through this in detail and that's excellent reference for that as well.
},
{
    438.92,444.0
     The point we're trying to make today is that you know, if it's a bulging disc or a herniated disc
},
{
    444.0,451.28
     you're gonna probably try some type of like extension and if it's not, if it's more stenosis then you're going to do the flexion
},
{
    451.28,455.12
     right Brad? Right you want to demonstrate that? Well first off I want to talk just real briefly
},
{
    455.12,461.68
     what a lot of times what makes that worse if it's stenosis. Right the big thing with that is typically
},
{
    461.68,465.36
     standing in a long-term period period I have stenosis in my
},
{
    465.36,470.44
     back and if I stand in one spot for more than 15 to 20 minutes I'll start to feel
},
{
    470.44,475.12
     the leg pain that L5 starts to go numb or sometimes walking will also create it
},
{
    475.12,480.16
     right mine's not that bad but it's very common very common to have shopping
},
{
    480.16,483.68
     cart syndrome where it feels better to lean forward a little bit on a shopping
},
{
    483.68,489.64
     cart and walk right because it's opening up that foramen or that little hole and giving a little more room
},
{
    489.64,493.22
     Sure, so in that case, well you probably should do this Brad. You're the
},
{
    494.04,496.2
     You're the flexion guy. So
},
{
    497.44,500.64
     See if my tape holds on for our dermatomes
},
{
    501.24,505.72
     So the first thing you can do is just take one knee to your chest like this
},
{
    505.72,512.12
     and you can do that you know up to ten times and depending on your situation
},
{
    512.12,516.68
     you could go right to two knees to your chest. It's a little more aggressive but
},
{
    516.68,521.76
     if you do this and it feels good then it's a thing to do. Now these should
},
{
    521.76,527.04
     immediately make your legs start feeling better. Okay, if for some
},
{
    527.04,532.72
     reason they don't, it could be something else. It could be a pure form of syndrome, which we didn't
},
{
    532.72,539.6
     cover. But if it, do you mind maybe I, you know, actually what you might even start seeing is that
},
{
    539.6,543.68
     instead of it going all the way to the foot, maybe now it just goes to the ankle. Right,
},
{
    543.68,545.16
     that would be a positive sign. Keep doing that. It keeps moving up to the foot maybe now it just goes to the ankle, right that would be a positive sign
},
{
    545.16,548.86
     Keep doing that, it keeps moving up to the point where it's gone down here
},
{
    548.86,552.4
     But you're still feeling here could be the same with this one and the same with this one
},
{
    552.76,555.46
     You know in any case you want to try to get that
},
{
    555.94,562.56
     To not go as far distally as we said, right now if you start doing this particular one and
},
{
    563.1,566.06
     You think it's stenosis, but it really is a disc
},
{
    566.06,568.76
     Well this will probably start making it worse. It'll make it worse
},
{
    568.76,572.04
     You'll start getting more pain into the foot or you're like oh gosh
},
{
    572.04,576.22
     That's not the thing to do. So you want to do things no matter which which it is
},
{
    576.6,580.04
     That make the leg feel better. Right we go by symptoms. Yeah
},
{
    580.32,586.36
     Brad's gonna show a little trick here. He does with the roll. This works really well for people that have stenosis
},
{
    587.72,593.82
     And you put a six inch roll at a firmer one like I have here from OPTP
},
{
    593.82,599.08
     We've got this in our favorite products list below as well if you want to find it easy. Look at that your L5 is already getting better
},
{
    599.2,604.78
     Yeah, it's already getting better. But you have to put it below the belt line. It's actually at the sacrum
},
{
    605.32,607.32
     at the lower part of the
},
{
    607.88,612.02
     sacrum and you know for me right now this feels fantastic
},
{
    612.16,615.02
     It's just I can just tell it's opening things up
},
{
    615.02,618.92
     I could lay here for probably five minutes and feel and you don't look goofy at all. No
},
{
    620.12,622.12
     Well, look at that. There we go
},
{
    623.64,625.0
     Better Well look at that, there we go, I'm feeling better.
},
{
    625.0,628.0
     How far is going?
},
{
    628.0,631.0
     You know you may feel that kind of a relief.
},
{
    631.0,635.0
     Sure it is, sometimes it's like a switch, it just clicks it right off.
},
{
    635.0,637.0
     It'll go within less than a minute easily.
},
{
    637.0,641.0
     And then you can do these like every hour to the point where it starts to improve.
},
{
    641.0,643.0
     I look a little goofy like this, huh Brad?
},
{
    643.0,644.0
     Oh no no Brad.
},
{
    644.0,647.2
     Liz what do you think?
},
{
    652.88,658.64
     So do you want to talk about sitting real quickly Brad? Yeah we should talk about lumbar supports. If it is from a disc then you're going to use lumbar support with sitting while it is in your car
},
{
    659.36,667.52
     maybe in your couch or your soft furniture that you use you can use a towel to start off with it
},
{
    667.52,674.22
     Just take a simple towel roll roll it up tape it up like this and it should feel you're gonna put it around your belt line
},
{
    674.22,678.38
     It should feel real comfortable like real good support right away
},
{
    678.98,684.82
     And then if you find that works, then you might want to invest into a nice
},
{
    686.64,691.04
     If you find that works, then you might want to invest into a nice cushion towel These are the McKenzie rolls we like them just because they're good quality
},
{
    691.04,696.2
     We know they're good, but the size of it if you look we've got one two three four different size
},
{
    696.32,703.98
     Yeah rolls here some different shapes different sizes and if you have a big towel this would be small
},
{
    703.98,707.16
     So if you this oh, yeah yeah you'd probably use that size
},
{
    707.16,714.32
     Right and you know these are listed they tell you the size of them some of them are firmer density some are softer density
},
{
    714.32,716.32
     It's a little bit of an experiment
},
{
    716.52,719.52
     You do have to take a little bit of time to get to one
},
{
    719.52,723.08
     If you're a bigger person generally you take a bigger roll
},
{
    723.08,727.24
     Yeah, and it seems like if you're in a throw
},
{
    727.24,731.88
     as a back pain a lot of times you need the bigger roll and as the back pain starts to
},
{
    731.88,736.8
     or the leg pain starts to get better you can go to a smaller one, it's just been my experience.
},
{
    736.8,742.0
     So very good I hope that clears up so you know giving some good information on how to
},
{
    742.0,747.14
     correct it and where the pain is and how it relates to. Remember go to Facebook get that mattress
},
{
    747.14,751.76
     Yeah, there you go. Boy that'll be fun. Unless you're watching this in 2020. Okay
},
