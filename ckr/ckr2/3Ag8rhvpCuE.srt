},
{
    30.8,36.12
     bleeding mean. External bleeding is nothing but the bleeding caused due to the cut on
},
{
    36.12,42.8
     the skin. In simple words, the bleeding caused outside the body. The symptoms depend on
},
{
    42.8,46.24
     the site where an injury has taken place on the body but
},
{
    46.24,52.68
     the most common symptoms are the pain at the injury site and the visibility of the blood.
},
{
    52.68,55.98
     Internal Bleeding Internal bleeding is the loss of blood from

{
    55.98,61.84
     the blood vessels that collects inside the body. For this, the symptoms also depend on
},
{
    61.84,72.56
     the place where the injury has taken place. Then it might be pain at the injured side, swollen, tight abdomen, nausea and vomiting,
},
{
    72.56,83.12
     pale, clammy, sweaty skin, breathlessness, extreme thirst, unconsciousness, etc.
},
{

     go to help out the needy. Secondly, make sure you are not making a direct contact with the
},
{
    100.8,110.44
     blood. So, before touching the wound, make sure you are wearing hand gloves. These gloves will act as a barrier to prevent direct contact with the victim's
},
{
    110.44,114.92
     blood. Make the victim sit down and relax and take

     particles but do not remove them. If there is any foreign particle then leave the wound alone and call over an ambulance.
},
{
    129.6,136.8
     The next step is to immobilize the wound if possible and continuously monitor the injured area.
},
{
    136.8,142.0
     Later which we need to choose a bandage suitable for the wound.
},
{
    142.0,147.08
     Apply a bandage directly to the wound firmly. But at the same
},
{
    147.08,154.12
     time make sure that the dressing is not too tight otherwise it may cut the circulation.
},
{
    154.12,161.12
     If the blood seeps through apply another pad and bandage over an original one.
},
{
    161.12,176.0
     The last but not the least is to clean up. Whatever precautions you take, there are chances that you might come in contact with the person's blood. Clean up the area. If you have any cuts on your skin, do wash them so as to prevent infections.
