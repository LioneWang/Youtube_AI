     Hey guys, Jared Bechstrand here, Doctor of Physical Therapy and owner founder of Tonentine.com.
},
{
    6.44,10.88
     And today we're talking all about poor posture, specifically what it is, why you get it, and
},
{
    10.88,13.84
     some simple steps that you can take to hopefully fix this problem.
},
{
    13.84,24.96
     We're coming at you right now.
},
{
    24.96,29.28
     Alright so as a physical therapist, people come in to see me all the time with poor posture.
},
{
    29.28,33.12
     The thing is, they don't realize that it's the poor posture that's actually the source
},
{
    33.12,34.12
     of their pain.
},
{
    34.12,37.98
     They'll come in and they'll complain about neck pain, upper shoulder pain, knots in their
},
{
    37.98,41.0
     upper shoulder, pain in their upper back, even kind of headaches.
},
{
    41.0,44.44
     If you get those headaches that originate right at the base of your skull, those are
},
{
    44.44,48.32
     the types of complaints that people with poor posture come in and see me about.
},
{
    48.32,52.72
     Without realizing that it's actually their posture that's the source of all of that pain.
},
{
    52.72,57.36
     So we spend a lot of time educating, we spend a lot of time strengthening, positioning the head,
},
{
    57.36,61.68
     just in a better position to mitigate some of that stress. Let me show you what I mean.
},
{
    61.68,65.0
     In order to understand poor posture, I need to tell you about good posture.
},
{
    65.0,70.0
     Good posture looks just like this. My ear should be right over my shoulder.
},
{
    70.0,76.0
     My shoulders are back, my chest is high. This is what normal posture should look like.
},
{
    76.0,81.0
     However, how many of us walk around like this all day? I beg to say the majority of us probably don't.
},
{
    81.0,88.28
     What happens is we start to round forward a little bit. Gravity starts to pull our shoulders, we round our shoulders forward, the head
},
{
    88.28,92.08
     comes forward of the shoulder, so you'll see that the tip of my ear here is
},
{
    92.08,96.8
     way out over the tip of my shoulder and this is what poor posture looks like.
},
{
    96.8,102.5
     Now typically this is a result of a desk job. I call it desk job,
},
{
    102.5,107.04
     itis in my clinic and so your hands kind of round forward to that keyboard.
},
{
    107.04,109.52
     Our gaze is usually directed down at our screen.
},
{
    109.52,111.0
     That's a big source of it.
},
{
    111.0,113.16
     Another thing, smartphones, devices,
},
{
    113.16,115.12
     you know, we're always sitting right here.
},
{
    115.12,116.68
     You can see as soon as I stand up,
},
{
    116.68,120.0
     as soon as I do this, look at what's happened to my posture.
},
{
    120.0,122.28
     All of a sudden, it's just all thrown out of whack.
},
{
    122.28,124.24
     Ear is way out in front of the shoulder,
},
{
    124.24,126.1
     and this is what it looks like.
},
{
    126.1,128.62
     A simple test of this, what I want you guys to do
},
{
    128.62,131.34
     is actually stand up right now, just stand normal
},
{
    131.34,134.02
     where you're at, and put your thumbs forward, okay?
},
{
    134.02,136.26
     And so stand up, put your thumbs forward.
},
{
    136.26,138.1
     And you can see that if I stand here
},
{
    138.1,140.34
     with relatively good posture,
},
{
    140.34,142.34
     my thumbs are kind of angled towards you.
},
{
    142.34,144.26
     They're angled towards that camera.
},
{
    144.26,145.42
     That's where they should be
},
{
    145.58,150.98
     However, you'll see that if I do have poor posture if I just round my shoulders forward slightly now
},
{
    150.98,154.42
     I point my thumbs you can see that they're actually pointed at each other
},
{
    154.8,161.52
     Okay, and so it's just a really quick simple test that you can do to kind of diagnose where you're at on that posture spectrum
},
{
    161.56,164.12
     Now let's talk about some of the problems that arise here
},
{
    164.4,168.68
     Our body is very adaptable and our muscles are very adaptable. They're very
},
{
    168.68,173.16
     dynamic. Okay, where when they're in a shortened position they tend to tighten
},
{
    173.16,176.72
     up. When they're in a lengthened position they tend to get weak. What
},
{
    176.72,180.84
     happens with poor posture is you develop what we call in physical therapy an
},
{
    180.84,189.24
     upper cross syndrome. What that means is, again, I'm going to round forward into this poor posture. You'll see that if we create, you
},
{
    189.24,192.3
     know, kind of one side of the cross here and another side of the cross coming up
},
{
    192.3,196.72
     from my back, what happens is my shoulders round forward and that causes a
},
{
    196.72,201.0
     lot of tightness through my pecs. Okay, so we've got pec major and pec minor in
},
{
    201.0,204.16
     the front. You've also got one more muscle that kind of, it's one of your
},
{
    204.16,208.4
     rotator cuff muscles, your subscapularis that rounds from
},
{
    208.4,212.16
     the back to the front and all of those kind of get tight and all of those
},
{
    212.16,216.24
     kind of shrink down in the front as our shoulders round forward. Now
},
{
    216.24,221.0
     conversely all the muscles in the back so the rhomboids, the middle traps, the
},
{
    221.0,225.48
     upper traps, they tend to get loose as they're stretched out constantly.
},
{
    225.48,228.6
     They're in this constantly kind of forward position like this.
},
{
    228.6,231.28
     They tend to get loose, they tend to get weak.
},
{
    231.28,233.34
     And that's what develops this poor posture.
},
{
    233.34,238.32
     So we've got tightness in the front, we've got weakness and a lengthening in the back.
},
{
    238.32,240.88
     And those are the two issues that we need to correct.
},
{
    240.88,247.2
     Those are the two issues that we need to address in order to resolve this postural problem. So let's show you some simple exercises that you
},
{
    247.2,251.7
     can do to take care of that right now. Our first step in correcting this
},
{
    251.7,255.4
     postural issue is to stretch where it's tight. Basically what you don't want to
},
{
    255.4,258.8
     do is start strengthening too early. First you want to create the motion
},
{
    258.8,262.84
     available and then strengthen in that motion. When I say that what I mean is
},
{
    262.84,267.8
     that we want to get out of this position. We need to stretch up into this position and then this is
},
{
    267.8,270.62
     where we want to spend our time strengthening. So the first couple
},
{
    270.62,274.0
     of exercises that I want to show you are designed to kind of get out of this
},
{
    274.0,278.92
     up into this. What you're gonna do is grab your foam roller. This is probably
},
{
    278.92,282.12
     my favorite piece of equipment that I have in my physical therapy clinic. We
},
{
    282.12,286.84
     use this for quite a few problems. This is one of my favorite things to use
},
{
    286.84,289.52
     with a foam roller is actually these postural issues.
},
{
    289.52,292.68
     So this foam roller is 36 inches long
},
{
    292.68,294.4
     and it's a six inch diameter.
},
{
    294.4,296.24
     So it's a 36 by six.
},
{
    296.24,299.0
     I'll actually leave a link to that up in the description
},
{
    299.0,300.0
     to this video.
},
{
    300.0,301.44
     Click on that if you don't have one.
},
{
    301.44,302.4
     It's a great tool.
},
{
    302.4,304.28
     It's something that I use all the time.
},
{
    304.28,306.8
     And so what I want you to do with your foam roller
},
{
    306.8,308.4
     is lay it down on the ground
},
{
    308.4,310.52
     and then you're gonna sit down on the end of it
},
{
    310.52,312.72
     and lay it the length of your spine.
},
{
    312.72,314.4
     So it's going all the way basically
},
{
    314.4,316.84
     from your tailbone up to your head.
},
{
    316.84,320.08
     What you should feel here is just a stretch
},
{
    320.08,322.44
     throughout the front of the chest, front of the shoulders
},
{
    322.44,325.4
     as the shoulder blades kind of round down towards the ground.
},
{
    325.4,328.12
     It's just a great way to get out of that forward kind
},
{
    328.12,330.0
     of rounded shoulders posture.
},
{
    330.0,332.42
     Now what I want you to do is simply grab a towel
},
{
    332.42,334.0
     with both your hands, and then you're
},
{
    334.0,337.0
     going to take that towel up and over your head, just
},
{
    337.0,339.52
     as far as you can take it, knuckles all the way down
},
{
    339.52,340.12
     to the ground.
},
{
    340.12,342.8
     If you can get there, I don't want any shoulder pain going
},
{
    342.8,344.08
     on while you're doing this.
},
{
    344.08,348.7
     And then nice and slow, return back to that starting position. Now in my clinic what I'll do is
},
{
    348.7,352.6
     I'll set a two minute timer and this is the amount of time that I want you to do this
},
{
    352.6,357.28
     for. You're going to hold it over your head for about a 10 second count and then return
},
{
    357.28,362.44
     back down to your hips. Now a towel works well. I've got some golf clubs in my clinic
},
{
    362.44,367.8
     so I use a golf club with this. You can also use a broom or a mop or a dowel, whatever you might have lying
},
{
    367.8,372.36
     around your house works well. Everyone has a towel and so that's why I use that
},
{
    372.36,376.92
     in this video for this demonstration. Now again, the idea here is
},
{
    376.92,381.6
     that we want to lengthen out specifically that pec minor and that pec major as
},
{
    381.6,389.64
     we're coming up into this kind of externally rotated and elevated position. Again we're going to get out of kind of this forward rounded
},
{
    389.64,393.8
     posture and we're going to help to facilitate this type of emotion. Getting
},
{
    393.8,398.6
     back, opening up the chest, opening up the shoulders, getting back up into here. I
},
{
    398.6,402.32
     love that foam roller for that. The other thing that I like to do on the foam
},
{
    402.32,406.52
     roller, I call them angels. What you're going to do is you're going to leave your feet right where they're at,
},
{
    406.52,410.92
     so nice wide base of support. And now what you'll do is you'll start with your
},
{
    410.92,415.08
     hands at your sides, with your palms up, and then you're going to do basically a
},
{
    415.08,419.2
     big kind of snow angel motion, a big jumping jack motion with your arms. So
},
{
    419.2,423.6
     nice and slow from your hips all the way up and over your head. Try to keep your
},
{
    423.6,425.12
     knuckles down on the floor if you
},
{
    425.12,431.36
     can. You're trying to again just really facilitate that opening of the chest, opening of the shoulders
},
{
    431.36,436.72
     with this one. Set a two-minute timer on that one and those are I mean just four four minutes worth
},
{
    436.72,442.32
     of two simple exercises that you can do on that foam roller that really go a long way
},
{
    442.32,446.08
     and helping to open up that posture.
},
{
    446.08,447.96
     Now maybe you don't have a foam roller.
},
{
    447.96,451.56
     What you can do are either some doorway stretches or some corner stretches.
},
{
    451.56,455.06
     You can do them in a doorway, you can do them in a corner, both are pretty effective.
},
{
    455.06,457.28
     Let's show you what they look like in a doorway.
},
{
    457.28,461.84
     What you're going to do is place your hands up nice and tall on either side of a doorframe,
},
{
    461.84,468.2
     should take a step into the doorframe and then simply put your weight onto that front foot. What you'll notice here is again we're in this
},
{
    468.2,472.84
     extended externally rotated position, that maximum stretch position for that
},
{
    472.84,476.48
     pec minor muscle, and then you're going to put your weight onto that front foot.
},
{
    476.48,480.52
     Again just to open up the pec minor, pec major, all through the shoulders, all
},
{
    480.52,484.16
     through the top of the chest is where you should feel this. I actually like to do
},
{
    484.16,486.52
     this in a couple different locations so I showed you up
},
{
    486.52,490.76
     here nice and tall. Now what we'll do is we'll actually go to about mid-range so
},
{
    490.76,494.4
     put your hands at about shoulder height and then repeat that same stretch. Try to
},
{
    494.4,498.92
     step kind of through the door in that motion and then you can also do this down
},
{
    498.92,503.4
     with a low grip as well. So I'm gonna put my hands down low about waist height on
},
{
    503.4,506.82
     either sides of that door frame and then step through that door again
},
{
    506.82,511.48
     And again what you're going for here is that stretch through the front of the chest front of your shoulders
},
{
    511.52,516.5
     Try to keep it nice and comfortable hold up for about 20 seconds repeat that about three times
},
{
    516.86,523.24
     Again, we're getting out of this rounded shoulders posture back into this kind of chest out chest high position
},
{
    523.28,525.04
     That's where we want you to be.
},
{
    525.04,527.4
     Now let's show you how to strengthen and stabilize
},
{
    527.4,528.36
     once you get there.
},
{
    529.28,531.44
     All right, so we've addressed the stretching issue.
},
{
    531.44,533.36
     Again, we want to stretch where it's tight.
},
{
    533.36,535.44
     Now we need to address the strength issue.
},
{
    535.44,537.72
     The goal is to strengthen where it's weak.
},
{
    537.72,539.24
     To do that, I want to show you a couple
},
{
    539.24,541.46
     of my favorite strengthening exercises.
},
{
    541.46,543.7
     The goal here is to get the rhomboids activated.
},
{
    543.7,548.36
     Those are the muscles between the shoulder blades, as well as those middle traps, as well as those
},
{
    548.36,552.92
     external rotators. Basically, everything that's going to pull you into this position right
},
{
    552.92,557.28
     here to suck the shoulder blades back and to keep you upright. And so to do that, my
},
{
    557.28,562.68
     favorite home exercise, zero equipment required on this is going to be a wall angel. Okay?
},
{
    562.68,565.04
     What I'm going to do, my feet come out from the wall
},
{
    565.04,568.32
     just a little bit. You can't see that in the video here, but my feet are about six inches
},
{
    568.32,572.6
     away from the wall. I want your hips, your shoulder blades, and the back of your head
},
{
    572.6,577.48
     up against the wall. Again, the goal is to get into that perfect posture and then to
},
{
    577.48,582.04
     strengthen and to stabilize right there. Hips, shoulder blades, back of the head are against
},
{
    582.04,586.62
     the wall. What I'm going to do is I'm going to externally rotate through my shoulders to get my knuckles to the
},
{
    586.62,592.06
     wall as well. Now for a lot of you this might be really hard to do. If you keep
},
{
    592.06,595.9
     going on those stretches and if you keep trying to do this it does get easier
},
{
    595.9,599.82
     with time. For those of us who can get there I want to get my knuckles back to
},
{
    599.82,603.38
     the wall. My elbows don't necessarily have to be to the wall. If they can be
},
{
    603.38,606.16
     that's even better but not necessary. Kn to be to the wall. If they can be, that's even better, but not necessary.
},
{
    606.16,607.48
     Knuckles are against the wall,
},
{
    607.48,608.32
     and then what I'm gonna do
},
{
    608.32,611.36
     is I'm gonna perform another one of those angel exercises.
},
{
    611.36,614.44
     Keeping my knuckles in contact with the wall the whole time,
},
{
    614.44,616.56
     I'm gonna slide them up and over my head
},
{
    616.56,618.6
     until they touch up at the top,
},
{
    618.6,621.04
     and then nice and slow back down.
},
{
    621.04,623.08
     Now on this one, what I'll do is I'll set it
},
{
    623.08,624.72
     one minute to two minutes, so you know,
},
{
    624.72,628.56
     60 seconds to two minute timer on this and then just go up and
},
{
    628.56,632.52
     down nice and slow at this pace right here really focusing on the posture
},

     really focusing on squeezing those shoulder blades together in the back
},
{
    635.76,640.8
     while you're going up and down. That's what my wall angel looks like that's
},
{
    640.8,644.56
     kind of the phase one exercise as soon as that starts to get a little easier
},
{
    644.56,648.76
     let's show you what phase two looks like. Now phase two is going to
},
{
    648.76,652.76
     be the exact same motion we'll just take it into an anti-gravity position. What
},
{
    652.76,656.68
     you'll do is you're going to lay down on your stomach with your arms stretched
},
{
    656.68,661.24
     out over your head. Now what I want you to do is raise your chest up as high as
},
{
    661.24,665.16
     you can so roll your shoulders back back, pull through your back,
},
{
    665.16,669.12
     pull your shoulders up towards the ceiling. That's again the posture that we want to strengthen
},
{
    669.12,674.28
     in. And now just bring your elbows down to your sides and then back up over your head.
},
{
    674.28,679.44
     We're going from a position of doing a dive up above your head with your arms together,
},
{
    679.44,684.0
     pull down through your back to a position of a big W through your arms. Again, what
},
{
    684.0,689.6
     we're doing here is we're taking that same strength and position, that nice good posture that we want to stabilize
},
{
    689.6,694.8
     in and we're making it an anti-gravity motion. So those muscles through your rhomboids, through
},
{
    694.8,699.32
     your middle traps, those external rotators, they have to work even harder as you're going
},
{
    699.32,703.84
     through this motion, anti-gravity. So again, that's kind of phase two. When the wall angels
},
{
    703.84,708.0
     become a little bit easier, try it down on the floor, try to do some of those angels
},
{
    708.0,711.4
     down on the ground and see how that works. You guys are going to love that. It's a
