     on the internet.
},
{
    11.0,13.0
     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.
},
{
    13.0,14.28
     Brad Heineck, physical therapist.
},
{
    14.28,16.16
     Together we are the most famous physical therapists
},
{
    16.16,17.0
     on the internet.
},
{
    17.0,17.84
     In our opinion, of course.
},
{
    17.84,18.68
     We're all ready to go, Brad.
},
{
    18.68,19.68
     We're all ready to go.
},
{
    19.68,20.84
     We are spot on.
},
{
    20.84,22.56
     Today we're gonna talk about quadriceps,
},
{
    22.56,26.94
     tendonitis, or tear, the single best treatment you can do yourself.
},
{
    26.94,28.12
     This is an updated video.
},
{
    28.12,29.8
     We actually did this in the past.
},
{
    29.8,31.4
     I'm gonna do a better job now.
},
{
    31.4,33.44
     Because we're smarter and better, right?
},
{
    33.44,34.76
     Well, say no more Bob.
},
{
    34.76,35.88

     Just go to the giveaway section.
},
{
    46.68,49.7
     We're giving away a sleep evasion mattress.
},
{
    49.7,52.08
     This is just a sample of the mattress
},
{
    52.08,54.72
     and it obviously comes with a cover too, Brad.
},
{
    54.72,56.12
     Yeah, and it's full-size bed.
},
{
    56.12,58.28
     Yeah, full-size, whatever size you need.
},
{
    58.28,61.96
     And it's got 700 tiny individual mattresses.
},
{
    61.96,63.32
     Makes it very comfortable.
},
{
    63.32,64.92
     Brad and I can both attest to this.
},
{
    64.92,65.76
     We love them.
},
{
    65.76,67.82
     They'll also give away a couple pillows.
},
{
    69.16,71.72
     So this pillow actually has springs in it.
},
{
    71.72,73.64
     Yeah, that's a very unique thing about that.
},
{
    73.64,76.22
     And you can't tell it's in it when it's together,
},
{
    76.22,77.72
     but we just did that so you'd prove it.
},
{
    77.72,78.72
     You know, we can pull one out.
},
{
    78.72,80.64
     You got ready to sign it too fast.
},
{
    80.64,81.48
     Oh!
},
{
    81.48,83.2
     We'll also go to Facebook
},
{
    83.2,85.52
     and it'll be pinned to the top of the page,
},
{
    85.52,86.86
     the contest that is.
},
{
    86.86,88.96
     You can go to TikTok, Twitter, or Instagram
},

     Each day, each and every day.
},
{
    94.12,96.76
     Yeah, we don't take vacations, Bob.
},
{
    96.76,98.76
     Well, at least on the videos.
},
{
    98.76,102.08
     So Bob, we wanna talk about quadriceps,
},
{
    102.08,103.92
     one of the largest muscle groups.
},
{
    103.92,105.8
     They all work together pretty much in her body,
},
{
    105.8,107.8
     right here in her thigh.
},
{
    107.8,112.28
     And those can get strained, they can have a tear,
},
{
    112.28,114.96
     micro tear, that's what we're gonna talk about.
},
{
    114.96,117.76
     So I could actually be the poster trial for this video,
},
{
    117.76,122.24
     Brad, because I had tendonitis on both quadriceps
},
{
    122.24,123.4
     and I was from lunges.
},
{
    123.4,125.64
     I apparently, I was doing them right,
},
{
    125.64,127.36
     but I did them too, you know,
},
{
    127.36,129.6
     I advanced them too quickly.
},
{
    129.6,132.44
     And I had trouble with this for a long period of time.
},
{
    132.44,134.28
     I don't think you were doing them right Bob.
},
{
    134.28,135.8
     I was doing them right.
},
{
    135.8,137.34
     I just, I just.
},
{
    137.34,138.18
     I know I'm just kidding.
},
{
    138.18,140.94
     At my age, these things happen.
},
{
    142.16,143.16
     Where are we going now?
},
{
    143.16,145.96
     Now we wanna talk about where these quadriceps are.
},
{
    145.96,146.8
     Okay, sounds good.
},
{
    146.8,149.0
     We're gonna get Sam over here.
},
{
    149.0,152.24
     And, cause where the muscle actually attaches
},
{
    152.24,155.32
     on both ends can be really helpful to know
},
{
    155.32,157.96
     as far as how we're gonna treat this.
},
{
    157.96,160.2
     Now, if we look at these red marks on the femur,
},
{
    160.2,162.76
     that's where three of the muscles
},
{
    162.76,164.88
     actually attaches on the femur.
},
{
    164.88,167.76
     And then they all, and then there's one rectus,
},
{
    167.76,170.32
     the rectus femoris, which actually connects up
},
{
    170.32,172.44
     to the pelvis right at that point.
},
{
    172.44,173.96
     So it actually flexes the hip too.
},
{
    173.96,176.44
     Yep, so it's a biarticulate muscle.
},
{
    176.44,178.04
     We don't wanna bore you though.
},
{
    178.04,180.12
     But the thing that I wanna make a point is,
},
{
    180.12,182.4
     all four of these muscles come down,
},
{
    182.4,186.28
     and all four of them actually connect to the kneecap.
},
{
    186.28,188.04
     And then from the kneecap,
},
{
    188.04,190.24
     they go from the kneecap to the tibia.
},
{
    190.24,192.84
     So they cross the knee joint here,
},
{
    192.84,194.6
     but that area right there,
},
{
    194.6,196.14
     all four of them go to that point.
},
{
    196.14,199.56
     Oftentimes that is the point of the tendonitis
},
{
    199.56,200.4
     for, you know, what the part is.
},
{
    200.4,202.88
     That was the case of me exactly.
},
{
    202.88,204.44
     It was right in this area here.
},
{
    204.44,206.44
     So if we look at a real leg,
},
{
    206.44,207.62
     and I do have a real leg,
},
{
    207.62,209.12
     but it's not really worth looking at,
},
{
    209.12,210.48
     but just bear with me.
},
{
    210.48,212.56
     Here's my patella or my kneecap.
},
{
    212.56,216.16
     So all these muscles connect in right here.
},
{
    216.16,218.76
     We got the VMO, the Vastus Lateralis.
},
{
    218.76,221.7
     I don't even have a rectus moris that you can see.
},
{
    221.7,223.8
     They connect via tendon.
},
{
    223.8,227.04
     So tough, fibrous cord that goes from the muscle
},
{
    227.04,228.56
     and attaches to the bone.
},
{
    228.56,231.2
     And there's actually another tendon below the patella
},
{
    231.2,233.64
     or the kneecap that attached to the lower leg.
},
{
    233.64,236.6
     That would be the infraparticular tendon,
},
{
    236.6,238.36
     but we're not talking about that.
},
{
    238.36,241.6
     Now you could have a strain up in the belly
},
{
    241.6,243.24
     of the quadricep up in here.
},
{
    243.24,244.08
     That'd be more of a tear.
},
{
    244.08,245.04
     Or a tear. A word tear.
},
{
    245.04,247.92
     And you're gonna actually treat that the same way.
},
{
    247.92,251.48
     Obviously, if you've injured your quadriceps
},
{
    251.48,254.04
     and you'll know where you did
},
{
    254.04,256.92
     by the location of the symptoms or the pain.
},
{
    256.92,258.04
     Yeah, where are the tendons?
},
{
    258.04,260.56
     Right, if it's really painful and you push on it,
},
{
    260.56,262.44
     whether it's here or up in the belly,
},
{
    262.44,264.56
     and it's really tender and you can hardly walk
},
{
    264.56,267.44
     or you're limping, you're gonna need to rest it, put a cold pack on it, whether it's here or up in the belly, and it's really tender and you can hardly walk or you're limping, you're gonna need to rest it,
},
{
    267.44,271.24
     put a cold pack on it, give it a day or two to relax.
},
{
    271.24,273.08
     Once it starts to feel better
},
{
    273.08,275.32
     and you're able to walk a little better on it,
},
{
    275.32,277.64
     then you can get into what the actual treatment
},
{
    277.64,280.2
     we're talking about is the cross-friction massage.
},
{
    280.2,284.88
     This is no magical treatment that just came out.
},
{
    284.88,288.88
     Ciri-X, Dr. Ciriiriax came up with this decades ago.
},
{
    288.88,290.48
     Right, he's long gone.
},
{
    290.48,292.72
     He's been gone for 30 years I think.
},
{
    292.72,297.18
     So again, let's assume that the pain is down here
},
{
    297.18,300.02
     by the patella or the kneecap.
},
{
    300.02,302.2
     And you know, that's commonplace.
},
{
    302.2,306.1
     The fibers of the muscle and as well as the tendon
},
{
    306.1,307.84
     go this direction.
},
{
    307.84,310.4
     So we're going to go on this area,
},
{
    310.4,313.86
     find that painful spot, and if you can push on it,
},
{
    313.86,317.16
     and we're gonna go across the fibers this direction,
},
{
    317.16,319.32
     if you can move back and forth across there.
},
{
    319.32,323.22
     No, you could use both hands or your fingers like this.
},
{
    323.22,324.8
     Now, if you push down in it,
},
{
    324.8,327.0
     we're not gonna go superficial on the skin.
},
{
    327.0,329.9
     We're gonna push into those fibers.
},
{
    329.9,332.24
     What we're gonna do is break up the scar tissue
},
{
    332.24,334.64
     that's starting to heal as it's getting better.
},
{
    334.64,337.16
     And we're gonna make that scar tissue heal up
},
{
    337.16,339.16
     in a healthy, strong manner.
},
{
    339.16,340.0
     Right.
},
{
    340.0,340.96
     Right.
},
{
    340.96,342.8
     And we're not gonna get into a lot of detail in that.
},
{
    342.8,344.28
     He'll get more blood flow to the area,
},
{
    344.28,345.44
     which helps it heal faster.
},
{
    345.44,346.56
     Exactly.
},
{
    346.56,349.04
     Now, if this is a painful spot and you go over it
},
{
    349.04,351.44
     and it's like, oh my God, that really hurts yet.
},
{
    351.44,352.72
     Hold off on it.
},
{
    352.72,355.48
     You may wanna just work, you can work above it.
},
{
    355.48,358.44
     You could go below it, but you're getting into the kneecap.
},
{
    358.44,361.04
     You're not gonna massage your kneecap.
},
{
    361.04,364.76
     But you can get up above it and let these muscles relax,
},
{
    364.76,365.96
     get the muscles to relax.
},
{
    365.96,369.48
     That takes pressure off of the injured site as well.
},
{
    369.48,371.04
     And you can do this throughout the day
},
{
    371.04,375.24
     because this is a difficult massage to do with your hands.
},
{
    375.24,379.28
     I mean, they fatigue and they just don't really
},
{
    379.28,381.84
     get into the muscle because this is a big, heavy muscle.
},
{
    381.84,384.04
     One of your biggest muscles that, yeah, yeah.
},
{
    384.04,386.44
     Let's say you've got that injured spot there
},
{
    386.44,388.84
     and you start to go on it, it hurts.
},
{
    388.84,390.4
     But now I want you to pay attention
},
{
    390.4,394.0
     if after about 15 to 30 seconds, it starts to feel,
},
{
    394.0,395.48
     oh, it doesn't hurt so much anymore.
},
{
    395.48,397.04
     It actually feels kind of good
},
{
    397.04,398.48
     or it feels kind of nummage.
},
{
    398.48,400.24
     Then you're a gold,
},
{
    400.24,401.68
     and then you're gonna keep working that.
},
{
    401.68,403.56
     That's the key to this.
},
{
    403.56,406.28
     If you do this and it starts hurting worse and worse
},
{
    406.28,408.2
     and worse, it's too flared up yet.
},
{
    408.2,409.6
     You're gonna wanna go ahead and back off,
},
{
    409.6,411.52
     maybe I say some more.
},
{
    411.52,413.12
     But if you're able to tolerate this
},
{
    413.12,415.52
     and it actually starts to improve, like Brad said,
},
{
    415.52,419.24
     this is the exercise or the massage for you.
},
{
    419.24,420.32
     And you'll do it.
},
{
    420.32,422.08
     Siriac says up to 20 minutes,
},
{
    422.08,423.84
     which is pretty much impossible
},
{
    423.84,426.0
     because your fingers get really tired,
},
{
    426.0,427.36
     then you get tendonitis.
},
{
    427.36,430.92
     You get your fingers or problems with your finger joints.
},
{
    430.92,434.04
     But you can do this until your fingers get tired,
},
{
    434.04,437.8
     give it a break, and then come back a few hours later
},
{
    437.8,438.92
     and do it again.
},
{
    438.92,441.52
     Now again, I had a personal experience with this.
},
{
    441.52,443.88
     So I was doing that,
},
{
    443.88,446.84
     and I was also doing eccentric strengthening.
},
{
    446.84,448.12
     That's supposed to help it.
},
{
    448.12,450.42
     And I did this for quite a long time,
},
{
    450.42,453.28
     and it didn't help because it was just too much
},
{
    453.28,455.64
     with the massage to use my hands.
},
{
    455.64,457.72
     So I went to a massager.
},
{
    457.72,459.18
     And I-
},
{
    459.18,461.52
     We need a mechanical advantage here.
},
{
    461.52,463.36
     We need a mechanical advantage.
},
{
    463.36,465.96
     This massage guns work really well
},
{
    465.96,468.24
     because they really translate,
},
{
    468.24,469.48
     is that what you call Brad?
},
{
    469.48,471.8
     They percuss quite well.
},
{
    471.8,474.16
     Right, you've got this motion.
},
{
    474.16,476.2
     And then you have to get a massage gun that does it.
},
{
    476.2,477.84
     Not one that just vibrates.
},
{
    477.84,478.68
     Right.
},
{
    478.68,481.4
     You have to have one that travels forward and backwards.
},
{
    481.4,482.24
     Yeah.
},
{
    482.24,483.64
     You can see.
},
{
    484.64,485.5
     Go ahead, Bob.
},
{
    485.5,488.46
     Well, you don't want to skimp on these either, Brad,
},
{
    488.46,491.14
     because my nephew just bought one of these.
},
{
    491.14,493.42
     And he said it was just junk.
},
{
    493.42,494.9
     And so I sent him one of ours.
},
{
    494.9,495.74
     Well, of course.
},
{
    495.74,497.02
     Yeah, so we actually have some,
},
{
    497.02,500.34
     and ours actually, good quality, they're great price.
},
{
    500.34,502.34
     And they have our name on them too, Bob and Brad.
},
{
    502.34,504.46
     So if you want to get one that you know is gonna work,
},
{
    504.46,505.4
     you know, these will.
},
{
    505.4,507.02
     Well, that's kind of a cute little one, Brad,
},
{
    507.02,508.18
     but it's still pretty powerful.
},
{
    508.18,509.54
     Yeah, it'll do the job.
},
{
    509.54,510.64
     This one's better.
},
{
    511.58,514.1
     Now, when I was doing this,
},
{
    514.1,516.48
     I would do it not only to the end of the muscle,
},
{
    516.48,519.34
     I did actually go onto the kneecap a little bit,
},
{
    519.34,520.18
     believe it or not.
},
{
    520.18,522.94
     And that's where this round head,
},
{
    522.94,525.0
     it comes with a bunch of head attachments.
},
{
    525.0,526.96
     They both come with five different heads.
},
{
    526.96,529.72
     Obviously, you're not gonna use this one
},
{
    529.72,531.92
     around your patella, that's a whole nother.
},
{
    531.92,534.88
     So I just gently rolled it on top of the patella.
},
{
    534.88,536.68
     There must have been some scar tissue there Brad.
},
{
    536.68,539.92
     So if you look at Brad's knee, I'm rolling it right around
},
{
    539.92,543.2
     and it actually was comfortable through my clothes.
},
{
    543.2,546.4
     Now, see now these travel this way
},
{
    546.4,548.34
     and we're doing it sideways for a reason
},
{
    548.34,549.76
     because if we went up and down.
},
{
    549.76,551.76
     Look at it bumping on my head.
},
{
    551.76,553.64
     And it's actually pretty painful.
},
{
    553.64,555.44
     So that's, and that's just what, you know,
},
{
    555.44,558.08
     you would do that if it was up in the muscle belly.
},
{
    558.08,559.12
     Yeah, then you can hit.
},
{
    559.12,561.64
     Then you may go that direction.
},
{
    561.64,563.16
     But we're gonna go sideways
},
{
    563.16,567.56
     and get that cross friction benefit going that direction. But we're gonna go sideways and get that cross-friction benefit over that tendon
},
{
    568.64,571.04
     and it's not gonna irritate the patella.
},
{
    571.04,572.0
     And again, now-
},
{
    572.0,573.84
     Now if this makes your pain worse, don't do it.
},
{
    573.84,575.66
     I mean, if you do it on the, you know,
},
{
    575.66,579.0
     hit the top of the kneecap and ah, ah, ah, ah.
},
{
    579.0,580.44
     But it felt so good to me.
},
{
    580.44,582.24
     I'm telling you, Brad,
},
{
    582.24,585.12
     it was 80% better within two treatments of this.
},
{
    585.12,585.96
     Oh really?
},
{
    585.96,587.28
     I mean, it seriously was.
},
{
    587.28,589.28
     And how, yeah, and your fingers didn't get so...
},
{
    589.28,592.44
     No, no, I mean, I could do this all day.
},
{
    592.44,594.72
     I mean, it's an easy thing to do.
},
{
    594.72,597.28
     And that's why there are certain things
},
{
    597.28,598.72
     when you need to do massage
},
{
    598.72,601.76
     where a mechanical massage works a lot better.
},
{
    601.76,603.36
     I mean, it just does.
},
{
    603.36,605.48
     Especially when you get the big muscles,
},
{
    605.48,609.4
     you know, pier, pharmacy, hamstring, calf.
},
{
    609.4,611.68
     No, I think you need a massager.
},
{
    611.68,615.2
     And the other thing is, is if you're an active person
},
{
    615.2,618.36
     or you have an active family, other people in the family,
},
{
    618.36,620.48
     you're, other people are gonna use these.
},
{
    620.48,622.72
     It's not like you're gonna use it for your terror
},
{
    622.72,623.8
     and then leave it set.
},
{
    623.8,627.36
     Yeah, they're actually good for pre-workouts.
},
{
    627.36,628.2
     Yep.
},
{
    628.2,630.64
     I mean, because they really get the muscle pliable.
},
{
    630.64,633.6
     So if you're having a problematic muscle
},
{
    633.6,635.96
     that, you know, explain like your hamstrings,
},
{
    635.96,638.96
     make sure you massage it before you actually work out
},
{
    638.96,641.72
     or you participate in that sporting event.
},
{
    641.72,645.44
     So you can make sure that you're much less likely to tear it.
},
{
    645.44,647.32
     Now this morning I went for a run
},
{
    647.32,650.16
     and I actually got out here to my calf muscle.
},
{
    650.16,651.76
     They kind of bothered me because I got a week
},
{
    651.76,654.4
     of good running yet before snowballs come and go.
},
{
    654.4,657.4
     And I think, so I'm going to work my calf muscle
},
{
    657.4,658.64
     and it just feels great.
},
{
    658.64,660.68
     It's just, that's just fun to do.
},
{
    660.68,661.76
     You can,
},
{
    661.76,663.68
     I bet you everybody loves watching us use this.
},
{
    663.68,664.52
     You know, that's,
},
{
    664.52,665.48
     but seriously for the quadricep like we mentioned, to do, you can- I bet you everybody loves watching us use this. You know what I mean?
},
{
    665.48,667.84
     Seriously, for the quadricep, like we mentioned,
},
{
    667.84,671.08
     that's the treatment of choice that we recommend.
},
{
    672.2,674.76
     But again, they're just a nice device.
},
{
    674.76,676.72
     The thing is, you can certainly start with your hand
},
{
    676.72,678.64
     to see if you get some relief from that.
},
{
    678.64,681.94
     But to be honest, I didn't get much relief from a bread
},
{
    681.94,683.08
     because it was just too much.
},
{
    683.08,683.92
     It was too hard.
},
{
    683.92,685.08
     Once it starts to feel better,
},
{
    685.08,688.52
     you can go to Google Bob and Brad quadricep
},
{
    688.52,691.02
     or leg strengthening and you'll see the next step
},
{
    691.02,694.0
     when it feels better to start strengthening that muscle again.
},
{
    694.0,696.48
     Yeah, remember Brad and I can fix just about anything.
},
{
    696.48,697.6
     Except for.
},
{
    697.6,698.44
     Broken heart.
},
{
    698.44,701.12
     And we're continuing to work on that.
},
{
    701.12,702.76
     We're so qualified.
},
{
    702.76,703.84
     So.
},
{
    703.84,706.04
     From the neck up. Yeah, whatever. All right. We're so qualified. So, from the neck up, yeah, whatever.
},
{
    706.04,706.88
     All right.
},
{
    706.88,707.72
     Carry on.
},
{
    707.72,708.56
     Thanks.
},
