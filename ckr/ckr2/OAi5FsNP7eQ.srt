},
{
    11.0,18.0
     And today we are going to talk about gum recession, which is one of the most common complaints of our patients.
},
{
    18.0,28.24
     This video will also be made available in Hindi, so if you are more comfortable watching it in Hindi language, I will leave a link to that video in the description box below.
},
{
    28.24,34.64
     So what is gum recession? So when the gums or the gingiva moves away
},
{
    34.64,38.72
     from the tooth that is called as the gum recession.
},
{
    38.72,48.6
     So in such cases the patient will be able to see the root of their teeth. You can see some black triangles in between the teeth.
},
{
    48.6,55.92
     They will have certain symptoms like sensitivity and also one major concern is the aesthetic
},
{
    55.92,57.4
     of the patient.
},
{
    57.4,59.8
     It does not look pleasing.
},
{
    59.8,65.16
     So in this video we will be seeing the causes of gum recession, how to minimize gum recession
},
{
    65.16,69.76
     at home yourself and the treatment of recession.
},
{
    69.76,74.66
     So before we dive into that, please subscribe to my channel because it really motivates me
},

},
{
    77.44,82.48
     And also if you found the video helpful, do take out little bit of time and comment below
},
{
    82.48,85.52
     and let me know what next video you want me to
},
{
    85.52,88.12
     cover in dental education.
},
{
    88.12,94.24
     So let us suppose this is our teeth and here we have the gingiva or the gums.
},
{
    94.24,100.6
     So when the gums they move away from the tooth or teeth, you can say they are kind of leaving
},
{
    100.6,105.6
     the teeth or receding, that is why the name gingival recession or gum
},
{
    105.6,111.08
     recession. So in such cases what will happen the tooth will start appearing
},
{
    111.08,116.44
     larger in size okay from the patient's perspective what the patient usually
},
{
    116.44,120.48
     tell us is that their teeth are appearing larger obviously because the root
},
{
    120.48,128.88
     is also now visible to them and then we can see some triangular holes between the teeth because the Jindjaiva that
},
{
    128.88,134.08
     fills the spaces between the teeth is not available.
},
{
    134.08,135.4
     So what will happen?
},
{
    135.4,139.72
     This will lead to sensitivity and un-aesthetic appearance.
},
{
    139.72,146.56
     If you do not treat the situation, it will lead to bone loss and eventually it can lead to tooth
},
{
    146.56,147.56
     loss.
},
{
    147.56,150.32
     So there is no point in taking this for granted.
},
{
    150.32,155.26
     Let us see the causes why you can have gum recession.
},
{
    155.26,157.8
     The most common cause is poor oral hygiene.
},
{
    157.8,163.2
     When you don't brush your teeth properly, you don't brush your teeth enough for two
},
{
    163.2,165.84
     minutes or you don't brush your teeth in the
},
{
    165.84,171.88
     morning and in the night, the chances of gum recession will increase. Why? Because when
},
{
    171.88,178.76
     you don't clean, there is accumulation of plaque which eventually gets converted to calculus.
},
{
    178.76,188.22
     So because of that plaque, that calculus, we have so much going on there, so much bacteria there that it can lead to gum recession.
},
{
    188.22,194.84
     Then there are certain group of people who brush their teeth very vigorously in order to keep them
},
{
    194.84,200.88
     clean. That can also lead to gum recession. So you don't have to do it more, you don't have to do
},
{
    200.88,206.56
     it less. You have to do it just enough to keep your teeth clean.
},
{
    206.56,213.52
     Follow proper brushing technique. Don't brush horizontally, avoid scrubbing. Don't use hard
},
{
    213.52,219.88
     bristles, use soft bristles. Nowadays we also have ultra soft bristles. I'll leave a link
},
{
    219.88,226.0
     to my recommended oral hygiene products in the comment section, you can check them out.
},
{
    226.0,230.8
     So you don't have to be a part of the group on the left and you don't have to be a part
},
{
    230.8,235.08
     of the group on the right, you have to be in the middle.
},
{
    235.08,240.24
     Then genetic causes, if you have genetically thin gum tissue, you can have more chances
},
{
    240.24,241.92
     of gum recession.
},
{
    241.92,245.16
     If you are undergoing orthodontic treatment, there are many many
},
{
    245.16,250.96
     cases of orthodontic treatment that comes to clinic and they have gum recession. They
},
{
    250.96,256.72
     might not have gum recession in say one month, one year of orthodontic treatment but yes,
},
{
    256.72,262.08
     even after you know five years, ten years there are patients who have had orthodontic
},
{
    262.08,266.12
     treatment and now they are having gum recession so that is one more
},
{
    266.12,272.76
     cause. So these are some of the causes of gingival recession or gum recession. Now let
},
{
    272.76,277.84
     us see how can we minimize this at home. Most of them I have already told you but let's
},
{
    277.84,285.2
     see that in more detail. Coming to the toothbrush. What kind of toothbrush do we recommend?
},
{
    290.16,296.16
     There are two categories of toothbrushes. We have manual and we have electric. If you have proper control over your electric brushes, electric brushes are good. But if you
},
{
    296.16,301.92
     don't get the proper control in the electric brushes, I would recommend you to stick to the
},
{
    301.92,307.44
     manual brushes. Now while holding the brush, don't hold it
},
{
    307.44,313.16
     with your entire palm because when you hold it that way and brush your teeth, you will
},
{
    313.16,318.48
     obviously apply more force on the teeth. So that can lead to gum recession. Just hold
},
{
    318.48,325.24
     it lightly with your fingers and brush. Then as I already said brushing technique is very important. Don't
},
{
    325.24,331.04
     brush horizontally. Don't scrub it okay. You don't have to... it's not a utensil that
},
{
    331.04,334.64
     you're brushing. You have to be very careful because we have soft tissues
},
{
    334.64,340.76
     there. You have your gums there. So brush vertically in this fashion. If you are a
},
{
    340.76,346.28
     smoker stop smoking because smoking leads to decrease in the blood supply
},
{
    346.28,349.8
     to the gums which can lead to recession.
},
{
    349.8,354.76
     And the next very important thing is consult your dentist as soon as possible because in
},
{
    354.76,360.0
     cases where you have plaque accumulation, calculus accumulation, you need to get it
},
{
    360.0,363.08
     cleaned by a professional.
},
{
    363.08,367.44
     You cannot clean in any way at home. All those videos that you are
},
{
    367.44,374.32
     seeing on the internet these days to remove the calculus, they are just playing with your mouth
},
{
    374.32,382.8
     to gain views and to earn money. Don't go for that. From your side make sure you are maintaining
},
{
    382.8,385.48
     your oral hygiene properly. you are using the correct
},
{
    385.48,391.96
     technique and consult a dentist for a proper professional scaling and root planing then
},
{
    391.96,397.28
     it's cleaning of your teeth at least once in a year is very essential.
},
{
    397.28,402.88
     Maximum cases which are in the initial level of gum recession they simply get back to
},
{
    402.88,406.6
     normal only by scaling and root planing.
},
{
    406.6,409.6
     So this is one of the treatment.
},
{
    409.6,412.96
     In fact, it is a starting stage of any treatment.
},
{
    412.96,417.56
     Scaling and root planing is done in any procedure and we begin with.
},
{
    417.56,426.8
     But if the recession is very much, in those cases we might need to do flap surgery. So basically we take a tissue from your mouth.
},
{
    427.56,431.68
     Usually it is from the palate and we place it in the
},
{
    432.28,440.16
     Recession area and we suture it. Then it heals. The patient is on medications and the gum recession gets fixed.
},
{
    440.56,450.0
     In cases where the recession is so severe that it is accompanied by bone loss, then we might need to do bone grafting.
},
{
    450.0,455.0
     So in bone grafting, we try to regenerate the bone by placing bone grafting materials.
},
{
    455.0,457.0
     So that is one method.
},
{
    457.0,461.0
     Yes, in home remedies, you can try turmeric, you can try aloe vera.
},
{
    461.0,466.88
     They can help, but the treatment your gum deserves is a professional
},
{
    466.88,473.12
     help. So don't go by youtubers claiming to fix your teeth. You might end up harming your
},
{
    473.12,479.0
     teeth than saving them. So if you like the video please give a thumbs up and let me know
