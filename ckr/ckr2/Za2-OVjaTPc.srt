     Hello, my name is Sarah.
},
{
    18.84,21.96
     I'm the lead physical therapist at Barnes-Jewish Hospital.
},
{
    21.96,25.52
     In this video, we will show the proper way to fit and use crutches.
},
{
    25.52,30.4
     Please talk with your health care team to determine whether or not crutches are the best choice for you.
},
{
    36.96,40.4
     Your doctor may have given you weight-bearing restrictions on your leg,
},
{
    40.4,44.4
     which tells you how much weight you can put through your leg. If you are weight-bearing as
},
{
    44.4,47.6
     tolerated, that means you can put as much weight through your
},
{
    47.6,50.0
     leg as is comfortable.
},
{
    50.0,54.88
     Putting weight through your leg should not significantly increase or cause you pain.
},
{
    54.88,58.76
     If you are partial weight bearing, then you can put some weight, but not all, through
},
{
    58.76,60.04
     your leg.
},
{
    60.04,63.96
     You should push through your hands on the crutches to keep the full weight off of your
},
{
    63.96,65.86
     leg.
},
{
    69.28,72.52
     If you are toe touch or foot flat weight bearing, then you may simply rest your foot on the floor.
},
{
    72.52,75.9
     Imagine there's an egg or a cracker under your foot
},
{
    75.9,77.66
     that you don't want to crush.
},
{
    77.66,80.14
     It's important to know that toe touch weight bearing
},
{
    80.14,83.9
     does not mean that only your toe can touch the ground.
},
{
    83.9,90.16
     It is important to allow your entire foot to rest flat on the ground.
},
{
    90.16,93.92
     If you are non-weightbearing then you can't put any weight through your foot.
},
{
    93.92,98.08
     You should push through your hands on the crutches to keep the weight off of your
},
{
    98.08,101.52
     foot as you walk. You should be able to walk without your
},
{
    101.52,108.4
     foot touching the ground. No matter what your weightbe restrictions are, make sure that you never lean on the
},
{
    108.4,110.12
     tops of your crutches.
},
{
    110.12,114.28
     You can hurt a nerve causing numbness and tingling in your arm.
},
{
    114.28,127.0
     Put all of your weight through your hands, not your armpits. Stay in tall with your shoes on. Make sure your shoes have low heels and good support.
},
{
    131.16,137.84
     Put the crutches under your arms. Relax your arms and let them hang down over the crutches.
},
{
    137.84,143.24
     There should be a 2 inch space between your armpit and the top of the crutch. With your
},
{
    143.24,147.8
     hands hanging relaxed, the hand grips should be at the level of your wrist.
},
{
    147.8,160.6
     When holding the hand grips, your elbows should be bent slightly to about 30 degrees.
},
{
    160.6,167.0
     To stand up, hold both crutches by the hand grips in one hand and push up with the other hand on the chair.
},
{
    167.0,170.0
     Then put one crutch under each arm.
},
{
    171.0,177.0
     To sit down, place both crutches in one hand, holding the hand grips together,
},
{
    177.0,182.0
     and reach for the chair with your other hand to lower yourself slowly.
},
{
    188.8,193.4
     yourself slowly. To take a step, squeeze the crutches between your upper arms and ribs.
},
{
    193.4,197.04
     Put the weight through your hands, not your armpits.
},
{
    197.04,199.26
     Move the crutches forward.
},
{
    199.26,204.4
     Move your injured leg forward and put your foot even with the crutches.
},
{
    204.4,205.6
     Put as much weight as you are
},
{
    205.6,209.9
     allowed on the injured leg. Taking the rest of the weight through your arms and
},
{
    209.9,216.32
     hands. Step past with your stronger leg. In summary, move the crutches first, your
},
{
    216.32,221.2
     injured leg next, and then your stronger leg.
},
{
    232.6,236.24
     To go upstairs with a handrail, place one crutch under one arm and use the handrail with the other arm for support.
},
{
    236.24,242.68
     Step up with the stronger leg, then the injured leg, and lastly, bring up the crutch.
},
{
    242.68,245.04
     Always make sure the crutch tip is completely on the
},
{
    245.04,250.28
     stair. If you do not have a handrail be very careful as you could lose your
},
{
    250.28,255.36
     balance. Have someone help you or avoid the stairs until you are stronger. Place
},
{
    255.36,262.2
     one crutch under each arm. Step up with the stronger leg then bring the injured
},
{
    262.2,268.16
     leg and your crutches up together. To go downstairs
},
{
    268.16,273.44
     with a handrail, place one crutch under one arm and use the handrail with the
},
{
    273.44,279.48
     other arm for support. Lower the crutch down to the step below and move your
},
{
    279.48,286.24
     injured leg down and then bring your stronger leg down. Always make sure the crutch tip
},
{
    286.24,292.72
     is completely on the stair. If you do not have a handrail, be very careful as you
},
{
    292.72,297.4
     can lose your balance. Have someone help you or avoid the stairs until you are
},
{
    297.4,303.48
     stronger. Place one crutch under each arm. Step down with your crutches and your
},
{
    303.48,306.06
     injured leg together, then bring your
},
{
    306.06,309.16
     stronger leg down.
},
{
    313.92,319.94
     If you do not feel steady on crutches, a walker is another option. The walker does
},
{
    319.94,331.68
     offer more stability. If you need to go up one step with a walker, you should do this backwards.
},
{
    331.68,336.76
     Going down one step, you should go forwards, leading with your walker and your injured
},
{
    336.76,337.76
     leg.
},
{
    337.76,351.78
     More than one step is not safe with a walker. Be sure to sit for a few minutes before standing while sitting review the process for the safe
},
{
    351.78,357.8
     use of crutches. Once you are standing be sure that you are stable before you start moving.
},
{
    357.8,365.96
     If at any time you do not feel stable you should stop and sit down on a safe surface.
},
{
    365.96,370.68
     In conclusion, be sure to check with your health care team to determine whether or not
},
{
    370.68,374.04
     crutches are the safest choice for your situation.
},
{
    374.04,378.4
     Be sure that your environment is also safe for the use of crutches.
},
{
    378.4,381.44
     This means that your environment should be free of clutter.
},
{
    381.44,390.28
     There should be no throw rugs or loose edges on carpeting, and absolutely do not use crutches on wet surfaces. If you have any questions or
},
{
    390.28,394.42
     you have any difficulty using crutches, please discuss these with your health
},
{
    394.42,398.28
     care team. Thank you for watching.
