     Bob and Brad the two most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    9.04,12.32
     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist, Brad Heineck physical therapist
},
{
    12.32,15.52
     Together we are the most famous physical therapists on the internet, in our opinion of course Bob
},
{
    15.52,21.0
     Hey Brad you wanted to show some amazing how you can make some amazing progress somebody who's had a stroke and
},
{
    21.4,26.96
     They're walking how you can progress that along, right the person's had a stroke and they're walking, how you can progress that along. Right, the person's had a stroke in this situation
},
{
    26.96,33.28
     It's going to be the left side of the brain, the right side is going to be affected. You can see Bob and I both have
},
{
    33.72,41.06
     tape on our right leg, that's a reminder for you and as well as for us that that's our involved side. In this situation
},
{
    41.6,45.08
     the person's going to be lucky enough to have fairly good use of the arm
},
{
    45.4,48.4
     Although it's not real critical what is with the walker
},
{
    48.4,54.78
     But the biggest thing we're going to focus on is balance walking and how can that person advance that?
},
{
    54.94,60.62
     Involved legs so it swings through and they can put weight on it and balance and walk functionally without falling
},
{
    60.62,64.9
     So Brad's got some neat little hints and techniques that you can use both as a
},
{
    64.84,65.48
     So Brad's got some neat little hints and techniques that you can use both as a
},
{
    70.8,74.5
     Therapist or if you're a family member working with somebody these are things you can try on your own We do get quite a few comments of people that aren't they don't have therapy
},
{
    74.5,79.2
     They don't have access to them right and they're looking for things they can do with their friends or family members at home
},
{
    79.2,82.64
     And believe me there's gonna be a number of things here that I think will help
},
{
    82.68,87.54
     By the way, I do see a couple people that are just coming in to make a comment if you are new to our channel

},
{
    95.32,98.96
     Brad and I have this thing that we want to be liked. Yeah, so alright
},
{
    99.8,103.94
     Okay, so once you know someone's had a stroke there at home
},
{
    106.4,106.56
     Or in the clinic
},
{
    110.64,114.64
     One of the first things I do is get them up on their feet and see if that leg Here we got the tapioe. Is that leg gonna accept weight or is it gonna buckle?
},
{
    114.64,121.66
     Obviously if it's gonna buckle we're gonna work on strengthening exercises. In this situation the person can bare weight and
},
{
    121.86,126.02
     fairly stable on it. So they you know get them have a
},
{
    126.02,129.9
     walker I think we can see that leg in there and I'll have the person stand
},
{
    129.9,135.32
     check without handhold make sure they're safe hands back on and then I'll go
},
{
    135.32,141.56
     weight shift so can they put all the weight to the right leg without having
},
{
    141.56,147.14
     this happy okay so and if that looks, well then we'll progress to the next step
},
{
    147.4,153.1
     We can go to some marching and can a person go up like this and like this and not only
},
{
    153.74,157.62
     Looking to see if the knee flexes, but does the knee
},
{
    158.18,165.24
     Hyper extend like that because that's a real common quadricep weakness that happens with a stroke leg
},
{
    165.24,171.6
     Okay, so we're gonna look at that and assess that if they have good enough stability with the marching
},
{
    172.78,179.2
     Then we're gonna go right into walking, okay, and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna show you some
},
{
    180.8,186.76
     Gate problems that are pretty common, some walking problems that are common, so here we got the tape
},
{
    186.76,191.02
     That's the weak leg, a lot of times the toe will drag, we have foot drops
},
{
    191.02,195.94
     So the toe is unable to lift up and dorsiflex so you have clearance and that toe drags
},
{
    195.94,199.16
     Which is obvious a big problem because it can cause you to fall down
},
{
    199.56,203.6
     Okay, so it can be weakness in the hip or in the foot itself
},
{
    204.1,206.92
     Anywhere along the chain there might be causing you difficulty
},
{
    206.92,210.4
     It's a good point and that's what therapists are thinking and if you're not a therapist
},
{
    210.4,213.88
     You might see the foot drop and you might just think oh the problem is down there
},
{
    213.88,214.92
     And the ankle
},
{
    214.92,216.92
     In fact it may be up here part of it's up here
},
{
    217.64,220.64
     Another thing with foot drop is you might hear this
},
{
    221.28,227.16
     Foot slap. It's the same problem. I've got a patient that I've been working with
},
{
    228.2,235.2
     Recently and he has this his toad goes out to the side and he's dragging it. That's very common too, right?
},
{
    235.56,239.82
     Exactly, so we're gonna show you a couple of really neat tricks on how to do that in just a little bit
},
{
    240.28,241.92
     okay
},
{
    241.92,244.8
     if things are going okay with a walker and
},
{
    249.62,255.92
     Okay, if things are going okay with the walker and you can go a hundred feet, a couple hundred feet on the flat And think well, maybe we should progress to the cane, so Bob why don't you show some examples with a cane
},
{
    256.56,258.66
     So I'm gonna move the cane forward then my foot
},
{
    261.56,266.24
     I might have trouble moving that foot forward, right so and this is very typical
},
{
    266.24,270.28
     you're gonna use the cane on the opposite side this leg is good, he's got
},
{
    270.28,274.08
     pretty good balance between the cane and here but that that stroke leg is
},
{
    274.08,279.08
     really having a hard time coming forward okay this is a technique that I've used
},
{
    279.08,283.0
     over the years and it works really well, we'll face this way, yeah straight
},
{
    283.0,285.54
     towards so what you're gonna do, Bob has a
},
{
    285.54,289.82
     Gate belt on so I'm gonna use that to grab. Always have a gate belt that there's a risk for fall.
},
{
    289.82,292.7
     And I'm gonna come around and call it the hip hugger technique.
},
{
    293.02,298.9
     Around here and my hip is going the Bob's hip and I got pretty good control. I'm not being shy here.
},
{
    298.9,301.94
     I need to know where his hip is and I need to help guide it.
},
{
    301.94,306.26
     So Bob's having a hard time bringing that right foot forward and I'm not gonna drag it
},
{
    306.26,309.44
     Forward by reaching down and grabbing it. I'm gonna throw his right hip
},
{
    310.26,314.9
     Forward and there it goes. Yeah, and I didn't do anything there. He lifted it for me
},
{
    314.9,318.38
     So he's really pulling on my pelvis here. That's what you're doing
},
{
    318.38,323.9
     Right and you're pulling it up and around like that and you know after time you can maybe
},
{
    324.1,325.1
     Help a little bit less and you're after time you can maybe help a little bit
},
{
    325.1,329.42
     less and you're hoping you're hoping I do more and more with time. One thing I'll
},
{
    329.42,333.9
     do is I'll give a lot of verbal cues. Okay Bob bring that right foot forward
},
{
    333.9,337.26
     bring it forward just like that bring it forward there you go up too far bring it
},
{
    337.26,341.58
     backward belongs back there you go okay take the next step bring the cane
},
{
    341.58,347.8
     forward now bring that right foot forward I'm gonna help you and there we go and actually these muscles over here in the hip
},
{
    347.8,349.9
     I'll kind of bump a little bit it kind of wake them up
},
{
    350.52,356.14
     Anything to get his brain to communicate with that right side. Yeah get more visual or
},
{
    357.6,364.3
     Feedback right where there's verbal and you can use visual and the way you do that is you put a mirror a full length mirror
},
{
    364.3,365.48
     In front of the person and then you do that together and once the way you do that is you put a full-length mirror in front of the person
},
{
    365.48,369.56
     And then you do that together and once the person can see that leg sometimes
},
{
    369.56,373.96
     They can make the connection. There's a lot of little tricks
},
{
    374.04,376.72
     The therapist use with strokes and these are just
},
{
    376.72,380.36
     Yeah, you want to give as many senses as you're gonna bring in as possible
},
{
    380.36,385.32
     You know you got auditory and visual and then you can also feel
},
{
    385.32,388.6
     Right, the tactile, so you got three things going all at once
},
{
    389.04,395.66
     It's very, it's taxing for the person with a stroke because they're working very hard and the mind isn't ready for it yet
},
{
    395.66,400.36
     But you have to push it, you have to get start hoping some of the other parts of the brain are gonna help out
},
{
    400.44,402.44
     Okay, now let's go to
},
{
    407.52,411.04
     Okay now let's go to the technique if the person has foot drop and that toe is dragging and you're trying to get that toe up so that it'll swing through and
},
{
    411.04,417.44
     this is where if you're at home and you're gonna need some TheraBand or
},
{
    417.44,422.64
     some stretch band, I'm gonna actually recommend the brand name TheraBand
},
{
    422.64,427.82
     because if you go online and if you look they sell it in five or six yard lengths
},
{
    428.06,431.1
     Otherwise you got to buy a big roll like they do at the therapy department
},
{
    431.1,436.28
     Yeah, and those are expensive for $150-$200 you don't need that much and then they sell other ones
},
{
    436.28,439.34
     They're only five feet long well that's not a long enough you need something
},
{
    439.44,445.94
     That's gonna be about two to three yards long and it will break mine broke here and I
},
{
    445.94,449.08
     don't really know why if you get on a sharp edge it broke this one just broke
},
{
    449.08,452.64
     I tied it not in is this a pretty thick stuff isn't it? You're gonna want to get
},
{
    452.64,456.28
     not the yellow that's the lightest you're gonna probably want the orange or the
},
{
    456.28,461.36
     red that's the colors I'd recommend to the TheraBand. Okay so you have a
},
{
    461.36,466.56
     length how long brand? Well if you double it up it should come up shoulder at least
},
{
    466.68,471.48
     Because of the mat this got shorter. I like that the chin if you double it should go to the chin
},
{
    471.48,474.32
     I'm gonna make this work. It's a little forgiving because it's stretchy
},
{
    475.0,477.0
     Step on it at the mid length
},
{
    477.44,479.44
     You're gonna cross it
},
{
    479.88,481.68
     Double cross it
},
{
    481.68,483.68
     Make the cross down by the toe
},
{
    484.8,486.96
     Then you're gonna go behind the knee
},
{
    489.28,492.08
     There you go, see how the X going across the knee
},
{
    494.28,499.28
     I'm not gonna go to the front, make a cross across the front and then
},
{
    500.48,505.06
     We're gonna go around and you can tie it back here or if you have long enough loops
},
{
    505.68,507.68
     Tails you can come up with it in front
},
{
    507.8,511.6
     I'm not gonna tie knot in there because I'm gonna hold it now
},
{
    511.6,517.04
     I showed my wife this and she said that's that's dangerous because it's gonna cut circulation off to their leg
},
{
    517.04,519.2
     And that's a good point
},
{
    519.2,523.44
     But you're only gonna leave this on while you're working with the person for 20 minutes
},
{
    523.44,524.16
     This is not on all day
},
{
    524.16,529.94
     Right you don't put this on and then leave the person walk around with it all day because it is a circulation problem at that point
},
{
    529.94,533.22
     Yeah, I think it would take a while before it's all circulation
},
{
    533.38,538.8
     We're being pretty conservative, but sometimes you need to be that way. So what's happening here is the theraband
},
{
    539.28,541.4
     Is literally pulling my toe up
},
{
    542.4,548.32
     And behind here it's keeping my knee remember the hyper extension we talked about it helps prevent that and it gives the
},
{
    548.32,552.92
     Porta on the hip and it's giving it maybe a little bit of hip collection or not a little bit
},
{
    552.92,556.6
     Yeah, because it's pulling right here, it really works with the chain
},
{
    556.6,562.04
     It really stabilizes things without and yet you can move but yet it helps
},
{
    562.04,568.16
     Right, I mean unlike a Neomobilizer which just locks you in place and you're not able to move it off
},
{
    568.16,572.4
     This flows with the body so to speak, so normally I was walking like this
},
{
    572.4,577.6
     And then if you put something like this on a real patient all of a sudden you get it
},
{
    577.6,581.76
     It starts to go through and you don't need all that help that I was giving Bob before
},
{
    581.76,587.16
     And once that happens the person can make the connection
},
{
    587.16,592.12
     and they can start using their own, hopefully make the neural connections and start using
},
{
    592.12,597.72
     their own body to do it. With repetition the mind starts to take over and it remembers,
},
{
    597.72,602.36
     oh yeah and they make some new synapses if you will. I don't want to get into all the
},
{
    602.36,607.72
     details that's pretty complicated. The other thing is if the person is walking and they drag their foot
},
{
    608.2,615.16
     External rotation, they turning their foot outward which is very common after a stroke because a lot of times that hip adductor
},
{
    615.16,620.64
     It comes back first before the hip flexor. Should we do this one on you Bob? Sure. Okay. You can use the same length
},
{
    621.28,623.28
     Tiff Hariband
},
{
    623.44,628.0
     Put that around the toe and this is easier to do it on someone else
},
{
    628.0,632.88
     and I'm gonna put two wraps down around the toe to keep it semi-tighter on the toe. So you went,
},
{
    632.88,639.6
     you crossed over twice. Yep, you can do it once, I'm doing it twice. You work with it a little bit,
},
{
    639.6,646.44
     you'll know the little tricks, that's if you're a little bit just do a little experience now the toe goes out this way
},
{
    646.44,650.32
     We're gonna go the opposite direction so we're going in between the legs first
},
{
    650.32,651.32
     Yep
},
{
    651.32,657.5
     And then we come around the so basically you're gonna make a spiral right Brad? Yep the opposite direction of the problem
},
{
    657.5,659.5
     I like this go right behind the knee
},
{
    659.5,660.5
     Okay
},
{
    660.5,661.5
     Okay
},
{
    661.5,664.5
     I'm gonna bring it there
},
{
    664.5,666.36
     I take that Okay I'm gonna bring it there. I
},
{
    673.04,676.68
     Take that I didn't mean behind the actually behind the calf. Yeah, not behind the knee but behind the calf Bob's really tall so normally with him. Yeah, you ran out of room
},
{
    676.68,682.34
     Yeah, we have to have another another three or four feet to go around his waist. So another one would go underneath here
},
{
    682.34,687.52
     Nope, this one go around the waist then. Oh,, I got you. And what I like to do is
},
{
    689.2,691.2
     At this point I'm gonna wrap it around
},
{
    692.12,693.36
     here
},
{
    693.36,697.4
     Oh like this? Right, and then I'm gonna go like that. We may have to
},
{
    698.04,699.52
     Hold it here
},
{
    699.52,703.44
     And you can work with this or you can just go right to here and go through a belt loop
},
{
    703.52,706.44
     Yeah, I would take it around and then tie it right here
},
{
    706.44,710.32
     Yeah, now I had and walk towards the camera then and do you feel how that's
},
{
    710.32,713.4
     Yeah, it's really hard to turn my foot out right now
},
{
    713.56,717.52
     This works out really good because this is a real problem with a lot of people and
},
{
    718.24,723.0
     It gives me a little bit of lift on the foot too, Brad. Sure, go ahead walk forward Bob
},
{
    727.08,733.04
     on the foot too Brad. Sure, go ahead and walk forward Bob. So yeah it's definitely, it almost feels like I'm a robot on this side that you know it's assisting my leg, it's really weird.
},
{
    733.04,738.36
     It is and you know you can do this for and hopefully the idea is you're only gonna do
},
{
    738.36,743.34
     this for a couple weeks and after that the muscles regenerate the connections and strength and then
},
{
    743.34,745.66
     you don't need it anymore. I really like this idea Brad
},
{
    745.66,750.64
     It's really a good progression. It is a neat little trick that works really well
},
{
    750.64,756.5
     And it doesn't cost $2,000 like if you get a custom brace made that sometimes they work and some don't
},
{
    756.5,759.56
     And the external rotation. Now let's say we go through this
},
{
    760.04,765.4
     For two or three weeks the leg is not strengthening the toe is not coming up at that point

     Actually has hinges in it and this is a molded AFO that these are really quite pricey that one's off the shelf
},
{
    782.0,785.32
     So these go in here they go inside the shoe
},
{
    788.84,789.6
     Both of them though normally you have to buy a bigger size shoe to make them work
