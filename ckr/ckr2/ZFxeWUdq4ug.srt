     So is your neck feeling tight, achy, and locked up? Does it feel like the muscles need to be
},
{
    4.08,8.4
     relaxed so you can finally get some relief? In this video I'm going to show you how to treat
},
{
    8.4,13.52
     and fix muscle spasms and knots in the neck in one minute or less. Hey everyone, Dr. O here at
},
{
    13.52,19.84
     SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. Neck muscle spasms, cramps, and muscle knots are common issues
},
{
    19.84,25.16
     that I treat in my office. They're usually caused by built up tension in the upper back and neck
},
{
    25.16,27.88
     from everyday stress, which we all have,
},
{
    27.88,30.12
     and from bad forward leaning posture,
},
{
    30.12,31.64
     which we're all guilty of.
},
{
    31.64,34.08
     This is a classic recipe for the creation
},
{
    34.08,35.72
     of muscle spasms and knots,
},
{
    35.72,38.56
     and restricted range of motion in the neck.
},
{
    38.56,39.56
     What I'm going to share with you
},
{
    39.56,41.08
     have helped many of my patients
},
{
    41.08,43.28
     get more flexibility back in their neck,
},
{
    43.28,45.82
     and help eliminate muscle spasms, cramps,
},
{
    45.82,47.16
     and overall tightness.
},
{
    47.16,49.34
     I'm going to break it down into three parts,
},
{
    49.34,51.92
     which will include stretches and exercises,
},
{
    51.92,55.24
     targeting the upper, middle, and lower parts of the neck.
},
{
    55.24,57.68
     So it should help you be able to get rid of those muscle
},
{
    57.68,59.68
     spasms no matter where they are.
},
{
    59.68,61.86
     They don't require any special equipment
},
{
    61.86,69.72
     and can be done at home and are really simple to do. So let's get started and get feeling better right now. So for the first part
},
{
    69.72,75.64
     of this guide we're going to focus on the upper cervical area. Primarily a muscle
},
{
    75.64,80.0
     group called the suboccipital muscles. The suboccipital muscles act as a
},
{
    80.0,85.76
     stabilizer and they help also turn the head. They get a lot of strain in them
},
{
    85.76,89.96
     from forward head posture so think if you're an office worker constantly
},
{
    89.96,94.4
     typing or at a desk, cell phone use, driving, you name it, anything that brings
},
{
    94.4,98.3
     those shoulders forward in the head down, they're going to strain those muscle
},
{
    98.3,103.92
     groups. When the suboccipitals do get strained and muscle spasms start to form,
},
{
    103.92,109.94
     what happens is it can lead to other issues other than neck pain including tension headaches,
},
{
    109.94,113.3
     possibly even migraines if it's bad enough.
},
{
    113.3,117.46
     If you've been having a lot of headaches, especially tension-like headaches, this is
},
{
    117.46,121.02
     going to be one that you're going to really want to pay attention to.
},
{
    121.02,122.46
     This is the exercise.
},
{
    122.46,123.46
     It's very easy.
},
{
    123.46,126.8
     We're going to find the spots in the upper part of the neck right here.
},
{
    126.8,130.52
     And then from there, we're going to take our fingers and make hooks with them.
},
{
    130.52,135.04
     Go back to those spots, those muscle spasms in the neck, and put a little bit of pressure
},
{
    135.04,136.04
     in there.
},
{
    136.04,140.44
     Just do a nice self-massage for about five seconds to help loosen it up.
},
{
    140.44,144.92
     From there, we're going to do a chin tuck towards the chest, and then we're going to
},
{
    144.92,151.36
     use our head and bring it backwards into our fingers to build more tension, I'm sorry,
},
{
    151.36,154.96
     build more pressure into those spots of tension.
},
{
    154.96,159.0
     And just give that a good hold for about 15 to 30 seconds.
},
{
    159.0,164.12
     Only go to your comfort level if it's causing a lot of discomfort back off and just build
},
{
    164.12,165.76
     into it very slowly.
},
{
    165.76,170.88
     What you're going to notice is that that muscle spasm will start to break up.
},
{
    170.88,175.44
     So give that a good 30 second hold or until it does finally release and then back off
},
{
    175.44,178.84
     and keep repeating it until you feel it finally go away.
},
{
    178.84,181.96
     So next we're going to focus on the middle part of the neck.
},
{
    181.96,191.12
     We're going to target a muscle called the SCEM or sternocleidomastoid muscle. And this muscle is responsible for turning the head.
},
{
    191.12,194.52
     So if you've been having a lot of issues, let's say while driving, trying to turn
},
{
    194.52,197.92
     the head to look over your shoulder, this is one that's probably going to help you
},
{
    197.92,201.4
     out. So we're going to find that muscle spasm in the middle of the neck. We're
},
{
    201.4,204.6
     going to put a little bit of pressure in there. Again, just massage for about five
},
{
    204.6,205.24
     seconds until you feel it start to release a little bit of pressure in there. Again, just massage for about five seconds
},
{
    205.24,207.2
     until you feel it start to release a little bit.
},
{
    207.2,210.44
     And the next step is to look over the opposite shoulder.
},
{
    210.44,212.68
     So turn the head as far as you're able to go.
},
{
    212.68,214.44
     You're going to feel that muscle spasm
},
{
    214.44,216.56
     get a little bit more sensitive.
},
{
    216.56,217.84
     Put pressure in there,
},
{
    217.84,220.36
     keep massaging for about another 10 seconds,
},
{
    220.36,223.2
     and then this next step is where it's going to get
},
{
    223.2,224.6
     a lot more intense.
},
{
    224.6,229.0
     We're going to take our chin towards this opposite shoulder. So again we're turning
},
{
    229.0,233.08
     our head and then taking the chin downwards. Just get in there, massage
},
{
    233.08,237.0
     that for about another 15 to 30 seconds or until you feel that muscle not
},
{
    237.0,242.92
     release and then just keep doing it until it finally does release completely. So
},
{
    242.92,245.62
     last we're going to focus on the lower part of the neck
},
{
    245.62,247.36
     and the upper shoulder.
},
{
    247.36,249.74
     The muscle that is most commonly associated
},
{
    249.74,253.4
     with lower neck issues is the trapezius muscle.
},
{
    253.4,256.28
     So the trapezius or trap muscle is responsible
},
{
    256.28,259.56
     for shrugging or lifting the shoulders up towards the ear.
},
{
    259.56,262.2
     So this is how we're going to target the trapezius muscle.
},
{
    262.2,263.72
     We're gonna take a couple fingers,
},
{
    263.72,265.64
     we're gonna find that muscle spasm,
},
{
    265.64,268.92
     and then just do a light massage for about five seconds.
},
{
    268.92,271.36
     The next part is taking the ear on that side
},
{
    271.36,274.16
     towards that shoulder, so a lateral bend over
},
{
    274.16,276.8
     while you massage it for about another 10 seconds.
},
{
    276.8,278.72
     Just put a good amount of pressure in there
},
{
    278.72,281.2
     to help start to release that muscle knot.
},
{
    281.2,283.68
     So this last part is where it's going to really
},
{
    283.68,285.32
     intensify this self
},
{
    285.32,289.44
     massage. We're going to then take the ear on the opposite side to the opposite
},
{
    289.44,293.68
     shoulder while maintaining pressure, and you're really going to feel this self
},
{
    293.68,298.16
     massage. Just get in there, dig at it until it finally starts to release. Usually
},
{
    298.16,302.76
     15 to 30 seconds, I then just back off and then repeat the process. So again,
},
{
    302.76,307.52
     finger on that side. I'm going to bend over while massaging it, and then I'm going to go to the opposite
},
{
    307.52,309.6
     side while I keep pressure in there.
},
{
    309.6,314.56
     And just keep repeating until you feel all the muscle knots or spasms finally go away.
},
{
    314.56,318.8
     So with this three-part guide, it should help tackle stubborn muscle knots and spasms and
},
{
    318.8,320.94
     get you feeling a lot of relief.
},
{
    320.94,325.04
     If you're still having lingering or recurring neck or headache issues, make
},
{
    325.04,329.56
     sure to make an appointment with your local chiropractor to have it looked at. Also, if
