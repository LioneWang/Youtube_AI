     Now that we've got our skin nice and clean, we're going to numb her.
},
{
    4.32,9.0
     Okay, so with the numbing packets, you're going to mix all three, the benzocaine, the
},
{
    9.0,16.92
     lidocaine, and the tetrachaine.
},
{
    16.92,23.28
     The nice thing about these packets is it's already measured for an area, so you're not
},
{
    23.28,26.88
     using too much.
},
{
    26.88,32.48
     So after you've taken all three out, you're going to mix the three.
},
{
    32.48,71.44
     And then I just like to apply it to the skin first and then rub it in afterwards. That way you're doing the forehead that you take it all the way to the
},
{
    71.44,83.08
     hairline because it's the most sensitive part of the face.
},
{
    83.08,91.48
     Now with this client she's got nice full brows, but for some people that have had a microblading,
},
{
    91.48,96.96
     you want to avoid where they've had that because you don't want to break down their brow work.
},
{
    96.96,108.44
     She's just got the nice natural brows, making sure we've covered everywhere.
},
{
    108.44,121.56
     And we're going to leave this on 20 to 30 minutes.
},
{
    121.56,126.52
     Once she feels nice and numb, then we'll get started. So with her I'm
},
{
    126.52,132.96
     gonna do the restore needle. I think with when you're working on scarring it's
},
{
    132.96,138.0
     gonna be more effective because it's gonna go deeper in the skin.
},
{
    140.2,144.2
     Whereas the refine would be a good fit for someone that just wants to work on
},
{
    144.2,149.68
     the collagen buildup, someone that's got maybe more sensitive skin, someone that doesn't want
},
{
    149.68,154.76
     to have to worry about the numbing or the downtime because with the refine needle, you
},
{
    154.76,156.88
     won't get redness like you will with the restore.
},
