    10.4,12.48
     Okay, hi folks.

     That's kind of three rules there too.
},
{
    38.28,41.76
     And you're going to want to go over to the Facebook and like us, Bob and Brad, because
},
{
    41.76,47.18
     once again we are giving away the Thermotex far infrared heating pad platinum pad
},
{
    47.74,51.56
     Beautiful pad this thing the reason why it's so much better than regular heat
},
{
    51.56,56.18
     It goes so much deeper 2.36 inches right there you go versus
},
{
    56.6,62.08
     Superficial heat you better believe it and it's good big enough to cover the back you can wrap your knee the hip
},
{
    62.08,69.52
     It's a very universal device. We love it. Yep. All all right so let's talk about the three rules for treating hip pain arthritis. The first thing
},
{
    69.52,74.88
     you want to do as much as possible is you want to decrease the weight bearing on that hip and I'm
},
{
    74.88,80.08
     not saying that you need to do this forever right but hip pain and arthritis tends to flare up
},
{
    80.64,87.16
     and tends to calm down so we want to get it to down. So what you want to do is maybe for a while use a cane.
},
{
    88.72,91.8
     Brad you got this little psychedelic one there. Oh, that is nice.
},
{
    91.8,97.6
     I just work with someone Tuesday this problem. I had to work with her on
},
{
    98.1,103.4
     a gate and her walking was like this. Yeah, she took the cane and
},
{
    103.8,106.96
     her walking became normal things calm right down
},
{
    106.96,112.8
     I'm glad you brought that up Brad because so often people say I'm not gonna use a cane and you know
},
{
    112.8,116.0
     I got my pride. I'm not gonna use a cane, but they'll walk like this like you said
},
{
    116.32,119.88
     They're walking like this wouldn't it look better to walk with the cane
},
{
    119.88,125.28
     You don't think they're drawing attention to yourself. I, you know, I mean, I understand it.
},
{
    125.28,126.4
     Believe me, I understand it.
},
{
    126.4,128.76
     I'm not trying to be unsympathetic.
},
{
    128.76,129.84
     I always tell them, you know,
},
{
    129.84,131.4
     you look more dignified with the cane.
},
{
    131.4,132.24
     That's right.
},
{
    132.24,133.56
     Some walking stick.
},
{
    133.56,134.48
     Some people buy it.
},
{
    134.48,136.84
     And if you want to have something that maybe looks like
},
{
    136.84,138.8
     you're maybe more of an athlete that got hurt,
},
{
    138.8,141.64
     just use a, you know, a crutch like this.
},
{
    141.64,146.62
     My wife finally succumbed to this when she She had her knee or sure and she was like
},
{
    146.62,150.44
     I can't use a cane again, but she used the the crutch and it worked out good
},
{
    150.44,156.54
     We actually had to put extra padding on there because you really start to rub it here and really breaks down the skin
},
{
    156.56,162.5
     So after a while and if you don't know how to use the caner crutch properly just Google Bob and Brad crutch use can use
},
{
    162.5,165.76
     We have some good videos on how to take care of that problem
},
{
    165.76,169.18
     Right in addition to like using a cane or crutch
},
{
    169.18,175.8
     You're gonna want to avoid stairs and hills for that time period while you're trying to get things calm down because every time you
},
{
    175.8,179.08
     Go up on a surface like that increases the stress on your hip, right?
},
{
    179.08,186.12
     You know if you do need to go upstairs simply go up with your strong or the less painful leg and let the site take one step at a time
},
{
    186.12,189.56
     That'll significantly decrease the good down with the bad
},
{
    190.92,194.72
     Okay next thing you're gonna do you're really gonna want to make sure you're stretching that hip
},
{
    195.56,198.68
     Generally quite often I had a patient yesterday like this Brad
},
{
    199.24,204.04
     He's got very poor internal rotation. So on the one side. He went like this
},
{
    202.36,204.96
     very poor internal rotation. So on the one side he went like this,
},
{
    204.96,206.6
     and the other side, that was it.
},
{
    206.6,210.04
     He had no motion, and he was getting pain in his groin,
},
{
    210.04,211.2
     and if I turned it that way, he went,
},
{
    211.2,212.44
     oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
},
{
    212.44,215.04
     so we need to regain that motion.
},
{
    215.04,216.56
     So we're gonna, you wanna regain
},
{
    216.56,218.4
     basically four different motions.
},
{
    218.4,220.24
     You wanna show them laying down, Brad?
},
{
    220.24,221.08
     Sure.
},
{
    221.08,222.52
     Why don't you do that?
},
{
    222.52,223.88
     So yeah, when you're working,
},
{
    223.88,227.0
     the hip is one of those things that's got four ranges and
},
{
    227.0,230.44
     if you're not a therapist, actually when I was learning this it was a little confusing,
},
{
    230.44,233.0
     but once you get your head around it, it's fine.
},
{
    233.0,234.6
     But hip flexion, should we go through that first?
},
{
    234.6,236.08
     Sure, let's go with hip flexion.
},
{
    236.08,240.28
     Okay, hip flexion means you're going to take your knee and bring it to your chest, so that's
},
{
    240.28,243.72
     bending the hip or flexing it this way.
},
{
    243.72,247.0
     And you might find out this knee is normal or this hip
},
{
    247.0,250.12
     And this one oh it gets tight in here
},
{
    250.12,252.32
     So we want to eventually see if we can
},
{
    252.32,255.16
     Get it stretched up to here without flaring it up
},
{
    255.16,259.38
     So this may take a few days or a couple weeks so we're gonna work at it every day
},
{
    259.38,265.04
     And if you have to use a belt or a sheet go ahead and do do that. We're just going to reach right in here.
},
{
    265.04,266.04
     Brad, there you go.
},
{
    266.04,267.04
     There you go.
},
{
    267.04,272.2
     So we just rolled up a towel, put some tape around it, and you know, you can go like this.
},
{
    272.2,276.52
     This just makes it easier for some people who may not have the range of motion or, you
},
{
    276.52,280.84
     know, their body isn't just quite shaped right so they can do this easily.
},
{
    280.84,281.84
     So that works.
},
{
    281.84,287.2
     You can go like this around the knee and stretch it. Again, you're going to stretch and hold and
},
{
    287.56,293.8
     Relax, do that five to ten repetitions should be enough for one session. Why don't you go to external rotation Brad?
},
{
    294.04,300.84
     Okay, this one you can take I always say take your ankle and put it above the kneecap on the opposite leg and
},
{
    301.68,308.18
     Let the leg go down like this. This is one way to do it. It's a figure four. You can actually do it in a chair too.
},
{
    308.18,309.86
     I'll bring the chair. There you go.
},
{
    309.86,312.46
     It's a really easy one to do throughout the day.
},
{
    312.46,315.92
     You can just put your knee across your knees and go ahead and give it a stretch like this.
},
{
    316.02,320.54
     And you'll find one that might be up like this and the other one's down like this.
},
{
    320.54,324.26
     You want to make sure you're stretching this one to get it equal to the other one.
},
{
    324.26,327.16
     Don't get too aggressive on the strips on the stretches
},
{
    327.16,333.36
     You know there should be no sharp pain whatsoever if you've happened to had a hip replacement or a procedure done to your hip
},
{
    333.36,339.2
     Yeah, you're not doing any of these you're not doing any of these just turn this tape off and go find something else
},
{
    339.92,341.92
     Go have a beer on us
},
{
    342.08,344.68
     All right, what are we doing next Brad? How about internal rotation?
},
{
    344.92,347.84
     This is the one that you just taught me this one.
},
{
    347.84,350.08
     Because this was kind of what it was hard to do.
},
{
    350.08,352.0
     But both knees up like this.
},
{
    352.0,356.52
     Now I'm going to stretch my right leg, the one closest to the camera.
},
{
    356.52,361.64
     I'm going to take this over my left ankle over the top of the right knee and I'm going
},
{
    361.64,364.6
     to pull it away from the camera.
},
{
    364.6,369.84
     And this really does a nice job on this part of the hip and you know you can adjust here
},
{
    369.84,373.88
     you can move your foot to get whatever feels like a good stretch when you got a
},
{
    373.88,378.42
     good stretch it's gonna feel like boy that's doing a good job you may have if
},
{
    378.42,382.38
     you have some mild pain but it feels like oh it feels like it hurts so good
},
{
    382.38,385.74
     or when you get done it really feels good. That's gold.
},
{
    385.74,387.26
     Yeah, you can bump up against the pain
},
{
    387.26,389.02
     but don't go into the pain.
},
{
    389.02,389.86
     Right.
},
{
    389.86,391.06
     You can do this sitting down too.
},
{
    391.06,393.86
     You can cross your leg over and pull it like this.
},
{
    393.86,396.22
     And so I'm giving a little bit of stretch like that.
},
{
    396.22,398.82
     You could even go like this, just work it this way.
},
{
    398.82,402.14
     But internal rotation quite often is affected
},
{
    402.14,403.34
     with arthritis.
},
{
    403.34,405.44
     It's usually one of the first ones to go.
},
{
    405.44,407.32
     So it's a great stretch to do.
},
{
    407.32,410.84
     You wanna show the combination flexion and extension, Brad?
},
{
    410.84,413.18
     So, you know, this is probably for people
},
{
    413.18,416.48
     who are a little more mobile and able.
},
{
    416.48,417.76
     Yeah, don't fall off the bed.
},
{
    417.76,419.68
     Please don't fall off the bed.
},
{
    419.68,421.44
     Please don't fall off the bed.
},
{
    421.44,424.64
     As far as extension, if you go to the edge of the bed,
},
{
    425.6,428.36
     so you're still stable and on the bed,
},
{
    428.36,431.06
     let the, right in this case, the right leg,
},
{
    431.06,433.72
     just relax and go over and let gravity stretch
},
{
    433.72,436.32
     that hip flexor, that muscle is deep,
},
{
    436.32,437.94
     right here where your pocket is.
},
{
    437.94,440.82
     Now what Bob was talking about doing two at once,
},
{
    440.82,443.84
     we can grab this knee and pull this,
},
{
    443.84,447.74
     so we're extending the right hip and flexing the left hip
},
{
    447.74,451.84
     You can actually bring your upper body over more can't you Brad this way over this way like that
},
{
    451.84,456.28
     So you're a lot more safe. There we go. Yep. Good good point Bob again
},
{
    456.78,460.94
     You know you need to feel comfortable. This is for someone who is more mobile
},
{
    460.94,465.48
     But they got tight hips, you know if you're 75 years old and have a hard time walking
},
{
    466.12,471.6
     You know in that stage of your life. This is not a difficult one to do right you can do a hip
},
{
    472.24,477.46
     Stretch the hip flexors also by kneeling down a lot of times I put a pillow underneath this knee
},
{
    477.46,481.16
     I got a pad right now, so I don't need to but as you can see I'm leaning forward
},
{
    481.16,485.6
     I'm stretching this one right here or if I were to reverse and do this and you can see I'm leaning forward and I'm stretching this one right here. Or if I were to reverse and do this.
},
{
    485.6,488.08
     And you can see now I'm stretching this one right here.
},
{
    488.08,490.08
     Put a pillow down because it's hard on the knee.
},
{
    490.08,491.08
     Sure.
},
{
    491.08,494.0
     I'm going to lean forward and you were saying I have good posture, right Brad?
},
{
    494.0,496.52
     Yeah, I was before my mic turned off.
},
{
    496.52,499.64
     Anyways, yeah, so he's got good tall posture.
},
{
    499.64,500.84
     He's got something over here.
},
{
    500.84,508.8
     He's holding on to the plant through the table, whatever there may be. be relaxed while you stretch. If you don't feel relaxed, make sure you breathe
},
{
    508.8,512.64
     relaxed, nice deep breathing. All those little things make a big difference.
},
{
    512.64,516.4
     So all that was rule number two. Rule number three is you want to strengthen the hip a little
},
{
    516.4,521.2
     bit. Brad, do you want to just show kind of a quick scenario of some hip strength that you can do?
},
{
    521.2,527.0
     That's exactly what happened. I'm still on. Okay, just some simple bridging.
},
{
    527.0,531.56
     So your feet here, if you do this in bed, you know, hopefully your feet aren't slipping out.
},
{
    532.06,538.56
     If you have your shoes on it helps a lot, but a simple bridge is going to work that back part of the hip, the extensors, the glute.
},
{
    539.06,542.82
     You're going to get some hamstrings with this too. Yeah, you know, and if you want to
},
{
    543.28,548.86
     isolate her to get stronger, just put one leg out. Oh and that gets quite a bit heavier. That's a lot
},
{
    548.86,552.42
     more difficult. We're going to do sets of ten. Does that sound like a good. Sure sounds good.
},
{
    552.42,559.14
     I'm going to go this way so I don't lay on my back my mic and a nice hip
},
{
    559.14,563.1
     abductor. I was just working with a woman who had a hip replacement on this
},
{
    563.1,569.42
     exact same exercise because she had the waddle in her gait. Sure. I do lots of these. Yeah
},
{
    569.54,576.56
     Yeah, you know you should feel that muscle net hip start. Mine's already starting to burn. Make sure your toe is not pointed up like this
},
{
    577.04,580.26
     There you go. And you know you can do the hip
},
{
    580.82,584.8
     Laying down like this and you can do some hip extensors too. There you go.
},
{
    584.8,586.6
     So it's real simple.
},
{
    586.6,592.6
     You can just go from their back to the side to your prone and you got them all covered.
},
{
    592.6,598.52
     Alright well thanks Brad for doing all the work. Well yeah, anytime Bob I'm always happy
},
{
    598.52,605.38
     to lend a hand or a leg. Remember we can fix just about anything except for a broken heart. There you go.
},
{
    605.38,610.12
     But we're gonna continue to work on it. We've been working on it for seven years now and we're not
},
{
    610.12,615.24
     going to stop. I think we'd be a little closer. Well we got a little progress. At one time we had
},
{
    615.24,None
     that little heart thing. It didn't work. Thanks for watching. you
},
