     Music Hello, my name is Greg Putra, Manager of Cardiopulmonary Diagnostics and Cardiac and
},
{
    32.68,34.68
     Pulmonary Rehab here at Allegiance Health.
},
{
    34.68,36.72
     Today we're going to be talking about cardiac stress testing.
},
{
    36.72,41.04
     The indication for cardiac stress testing is to look at the physiologic effects of your
},
{
    41.04,42.04
     heart.
},
{
    42.04,44.6
     We want to look at the rate at which your heart is beating.
},
{
    44.6,48.18
     We want to look at the response of the heart rate. We also want to look
},
{
    48.18,51.84
     at the response that you have with blood pressures during the test. So we're
},
{
    51.84,56.38
     physically looking at the heart physiologic action or the action of the
},
{
    56.38,60.82
     heart and how it's working under stress. Now the indications for the cardiac
},
{
    60.82,67.12
     stress test are many. It can be for cardiac evaluation for surgery. They can be for a patient who comes into our emergency
},
{
    67.12,69.64
     department with chest pain and it's unspecified.
},
{
    69.64,72.32
     So we have a cardiac stress test to identify whether or not
},
{
    72.32,74.36
     there's been any type of damage to the heart.
},
{
    74.36,76.64
     All patients who come in for cardiac stress testing,
},
{
    76.64,78.92
     independent of the type of test that they have,
},
{
    78.92,81.84
     have to have a standard 12-lead EKG,
},
{
    81.84,84.24
     electric cardiogram prep attached to them
},
{
    84.24,86.12
     so that we can effectively monitor
},
{
    86.12,87.44
     the rhythm of the heart.
},
{
    87.44,91.32
     We have a number of cardiac stress tests that we perform and a lot of it depends upon what
},
{
    91.32,95.92
     we're looking for and the level of the patient's ability to perform a test.
},
{
    95.92,101.2
     With our cardiac stress testing, obviously we try to get patients to perform exercise.
},
{
    101.2,109.6
     Exercise is the best way to stimulate the heart and to get an accurate view of how the heart is responding. In many situations, a patient is not physically able to exercise,
},
{
    109.6,114.64
     so we have to resort to using a chemical stress test, either an adenosine or a debutamine,
},
{
    114.64,119.28
     to simulate that activity of the heart to evaluate the function, the blood pressure,
},
{
    119.28,125.0
     the heart rate, and the ECG changes, if any any of the cardiac stress test.
},
{
    125.56,128.64
     We do probably anywhere from 10 to 15
},
{
    128.64,131.44
     cardiac stress tests a day, a variety.
},
{
    131.44,135.46
     Today I think we're doing some half our tests are chemical.
},
{
    135.46,137.24
     We have many that are walking tests
},
{
    137.24,140.04
     and we have three or four of the echostress tests.
},
{
    140.04,141.48
     So we're very versed in it.
},
{
    141.48,143.44
     It's a very safe procedure.
},
{
    143.44,146.88
     It's something that's very diagnostic and it's helpful for the cardiologist
},
{
    146.88,150.4
     and your family physician to determine what your heart is doing.
