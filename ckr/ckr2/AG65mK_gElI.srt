     Bob and Brad, the two most famous physical therapists
},
{
    6.72,8.02
     on the internet.
},
{
    9.26,11.2
     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.
},
{
    11.2,12.4
     Brad Heineck, physical therapist.
},
{
    12.4,14.08
     Because we are the most famous physical therapists
},
{
    14.08,14.92
     on the internet.
},
{
    14.92,16.6
     In our opinion, of course, Bob.
},
{
    16.6,18.16
     Today we're gonna talk about five tests
},
{
    18.16,21.0
     to determine if you have a pinched nerve in your neck.
},
{
    21.0,22.4
     Let's get right into it, Brad.
},
{
    22.4,23.56
     So. Yeah, why waste time?
},
{
    23.56,26.32
     A pinched nerve means there's pressure applied
},
{
    26.32,28.56
     to a nerve as it's exiting the neck.
},
{
    28.56,29.4
     Right.
},
{
    29.4,31.56
     It comes into your arms and provides sensation
},
{
    31.56,32.68
     and strength.
},
{
    32.68,35.02
     Now the pressure could be from a disc.
},
{
    35.02,37.4
     It could be from a bony, like overgrowth.
},
{
    37.4,38.24
     You're right.
},
{
    39.28,41.12
     Spur, I suppose.
},
{
    41.12,42.44
     It could be from muscle even.
},
{
    42.44,43.8
     Muscle been tightened up over.
},
{
    43.8,46.2
     Some inflammation, maybe we had some trauma
},
{
    46.2,47.56
     or whatever reason, but yeah,
},
{
    47.56,51.12
     the nerve becomes irritated up here, impinged,
},
{
    51.12,53.88
     sends symptoms and pain down the arm
},
{
    53.88,55.64
     all the way to the fingertips sometimes.
},
{
    55.64,57.32
     And that's the number one thing.
},
{
    57.32,59.72
     We'll first talk about five things you might see
},
{
    59.72,62.12
     and then we'll show you the five tests.
},
{
    62.12,64.36
     You might see pain radiating to the arm,
},
{
    64.36,66.88
     especially if it goes beyond the elbow. Because might see pain radiating to the arm, and it's especially difficult to be on the elbow.
},
{
    66.88,69.72
     Because regular pain can even go to the elbow.
},
{
    69.72,72.28
     Or sometimes shoulder pain will radiate died.
},
{
    72.28,74.3
     Typically to the elbow.
},
{
    74.3,78.8
     If you have hand, arm, or shoulder weakness,
},
{
    78.8,81.44
     that could be a pinched nerve.
},
{
    81.44,82.44
     It could be other things too,
},
{
    82.44,84.4
     so you always wanna make sure you go into a doctor
},
{
    84.4,85.32
     to check these things out.
},
{
    85.32,89.88
     If you have numbness or decreased sensation
},
{
    89.88,92.24
     in your arm, wrist or hand.
},
{
    92.24,95.04
     Now this again could be carpal tunnel or-
},
{
    95.04,99.84
     Yeah, they overlap and this is one of those tough ones
},
{
    99.84,101.64
     that's not always easy to clarify.
},
{
    101.64,104.2
     Yeah, it could be pinched nerve anywhere.
},
{
    104.2,106.08
     You know, it could be a pinched nerve in your elbow
},
{
    106.08,110.12
     that can send pain down to your forearm and hand.
},
{
    110.12,111.96
     All right, if you have tingling,
},
{
    111.96,113.76
     pins and needles sensations,
},
{
    113.76,116.22
     the same thing down in this area,
},
{
    116.22,118.92
     that would often, or can be a sign
},
{
    118.92,120.44
     of a pinched nerve in the neck.
},
{
    120.44,122.52
     So sometimes you have both.
},
{
    122.52,125.0
     Pain in the arm, wrist and hand
},
{
    126.32,130.08
     which is aggravated by any neck movements.
},
{
    130.08,133.64
     So like if you move your neck and oh, that hurts down here.
},
{
    133.64,137.28
     That's a pretty good sign actually that you have a pinched nerve.
},
{
    138.68,141.12
     Before you finish, I wanna add one more I think.
},
{
    141.12,144.52
     All right, feeling the hand fall asleep,
},
{
    144.52,146.72
     which you know, my hand will fall asleep
},
{
    146.72,148.96
     if I sleep with my arms up over him.
},
{
    148.96,149.8
     I had it.
},
{
    149.8,150.64
     Right, yeah.
},
{
    150.64,152.32
     But if it's falling asleep
},
{
    152.32,154.56
     and you're not really doing anything to it,
},
{
    154.56,156.4
     it could be a pinch of the arm.
},
{
    156.4,157.4
     Turn around once Bob.
},
{
    157.4,158.24
     Sure.
},
{
    158.24,160.6
     Another all the way around.
},
{
    160.6,161.44
     All right.
},
{
    161.44,165.0
     So if you're having pain in the shoulder blade area,
},
{
    165.76,169.44
     that's a good possibility it's coming from the low neck too.
},
{
    169.44,173.2
     Typically shoulder pain goes down the armor in front,
},
{
    173.2,175.52
     it doesn't refer backwards.
},
{
    175.52,178.08
     So that's another thing to keep in mind as well.
},
{
    178.08,179.4
     And sometimes you get shoulder pain
},
{
    179.4,180.84
     and then it radiates down.
},
{
    180.84,182.0
     Right, right.
},
{
    182.0,183.56
     So good point Brad.
},
{
    183.56,187.68
     So all right, I'm gonna have Mike now put up an image
},
{
    187.68,189.56
     of the nerves in your hand.
},
{
    189.56,192.4
     We have what is called dermatones in our hands.
},
{
    192.4,194.64
     And when you have,
},
{
    194.64,198.52
     each nerve provides sensation to a certain part of the hand.
},
{
    198.52,202.16
     So like the medium nerve is more like the thumb
},
{
    202.16,205.0
     and the two and a half digits, you know?
},
{
    207.4,210.7
     So if there's numbness and tingling or pain in this area,
},
{
    210.7,212.62
     that might be your median nerve.
},
{
    212.62,214.92
     All their nerve is over on this side.
},
{
    214.92,218.06
     And then radial nerve is in the back.
},
{
    218.06,219.92
     Right, so all three of these nerves come
},
{
    219.92,222.2
     from different levels out of the neck.
},
{
    222.2,224.68
     They go down into, they form into one nerve
},
{
    224.68,226.44
     and the brachial plexus through the shoulder
},
{
    226.44,228.28
     and then they start to branch off.
},
{
    228.28,229.52
     And it's really like a map.
},
{
    229.52,231.88
     Sure. And it can kind of give you a sensation.
},
{
    231.88,233.84
     Like, you know, if it's a median nerve,
},
{
    233.84,236.96
     that's often that is the carpal tunnel nerve.
},
{
    236.96,240.84
     So that'd be a sign that maybe you do have carpal tunnel
},
{
    240.84,243.96
     or maybe you have a pension and median nerve up in the neck.
},
{
    243.96,245.18
     Or you could have both.. Or you could have both.
},
{
    245.18,246.24
     Yep, you could have both.
},
{
    246.24,248.52
     So we're gonna show you five tests now.
},
{
    248.52,250.24
     The first one's for the median nerve.
},
{
    250.24,251.08
     Okay.
},
{
    251.08,253.56
     So you just take your arm out like this.
},
{
    253.56,255.06
     Yeah, I'm gonna smack you.
},
{
    255.06,256.48
     You bend it down like this.
},
{
    256.48,259.16
     And one thing you might find that I find quite often, Brad,
},
{
    259.16,263.16
     is that like if you have a good arm and an involved arm,
},
{
    263.16,266.86
     the good arm, the wrist will bend forward further
},
{
    266.86,269.16
     than the bad one or the involved one.
},
{
    269.16,271.96
     So you could do the bad side
},
{
    271.96,274.04
     and then go over to the side that's symptom free.
},
{
    274.04,275.8
     I'd gotta do it probably the good side first
},
{
    275.8,277.16
     so you can know what it feels like.
},
{
    277.16,278.2
     But not at the same time.
},
{
    278.2,279.04
     Not at the same time.
},
{
    279.04,282.04
     So you bend it and then you bend your neck away.
},
{
    282.04,284.04
     So you bend the wrist and then bend your neck away.
},
{
    284.04,285.72
     Balbo needs to be straight.
},
{
    285.72,288.32
     Right, yep, that's putting a lot of stress on that nerve
},
{
    288.32,289.16
     is what you're doing.
},
{
    289.16,291.76
     So same way on this side, you bend away.
},
{
    291.76,294.4
     So you get it up level and tilt your head away.
},
{
    294.4,295.24
     Yep.
},
{
    295.24,297.04
     Not looking but sideways.
},
{
    297.04,298.52
     So this next one's a little weird.
},
{
    298.52,299.8
     So this is the alder nerve.
},
{
    299.8,303.08
     So to get the alder nerve, you make a circle like this
},
{
    303.08,305.0
     and you actually bring your wrist like this. Now what I found with a lot of people is they can't even get it very far. you make a circle like this and you actually bring your wrist like this.
},
{
    305.0,306.9
     Now, what I found with a lot of people is
},
{
    306.9,308.12
     they can't even get it very far.
},
{
    308.12,309.86
     They can open it like this.
},
{
    309.86,311.36
     If you're younger you can.
},
{
    311.36,314.56
     Yeah, if you got good motion of the ulnar nerve
},
{
    314.56,315.4
     you can get all of it.
},
{
    315.4,317.64
     You're trying to make an eyeglass actually.
},
{
    317.64,320.26
     But don't do this at the same time.
},
{
    320.26,322.4
     But that, you know when we were kids we used to do this.
},
{
    322.4,323.24
     Yeah, yeah, yeah.
},
{
    323.24,324.72
     That's how I remembered it in PTSD.
},
{
    324.72,327.1
     Right, so you test it,
},
{
    327.1,330.22
     and then you actually can bend away while you're doing it.
},
{
    331.76,332.6
     There you go.
},
{
    332.6,334.48
     And if that brings out pain,
},
{
    334.48,336.68
     that might be your own nerve involved.
},
{
    336.68,339.24
     Radial nerve, so you're gonna stand,
},
{
    339.24,340.92
     I'm gonna go ahead and stand on this one, Brad,
},
{
    340.92,344.92
     face away, and then you're gonna lift up like this.
},
{
    344.92,346.48
     Okay.
},
{
    346.48,348.46
     And bend away at the same time.
},
{
    349.4,352.48
     So stand, face palm away,
},
{
    352.48,354.24
     palm up to the ceiling,
},
{
    354.24,355.36
     then neck away.
},
{
    356.8,358.6
     And you should do that standing up.
},
{
    358.6,360.16
     Well, it's just, it's hard to do it here.
},
{
    360.16,362.96
     Oh, because I, so if you're off the edge like this,
},
{
    362.96,364.24
     what I'm gonna do is. Yeah, you could certainly do it.
},
{
    364.24,365.84
     I just thought we'd clarify it.
},
{
    365.84,366.68
     Yeah.
},
{
    366.68,368.84
     All right, these are a little bit easier tests,
},
{
    368.84,369.88
     I think to do.
},
{
    369.88,371.38
     So the neck compression test,
},
{
    371.38,374.96
     this is just called Spurling's test or Spurling test.
},
{
    374.96,378.8
     This is an overall to check kind of all the nerves here.
},
{
    378.8,382.2
     And what you're gonna do is you're gonna extend your head
},
{
    382.2,384.32
     and tilt to the painful side.
},
{
    384.32,386.6
     Then you can actually apply a little pressure,
},
{
    386.6,387.84
     gentle pressure.
},
{
    387.84,388.68
     Straight down.
},
{
    388.68,389.52
     Yeah, straight down.
},
{
    389.52,391.96
     You're compressing the spine together
},
{
    391.96,395.4
     and you're closing off those holes for Raymond.
},
{
    395.4,399.16
     And if there's a pinched nerve there from that area,
},
{
    399.16,400.44
     it's gonna make it worse.
},
{
    400.44,403.84
     Now, if you just do this, that might be enough
},
{
    403.84,409.56
     to irritate it and cause, you don't have to continue. You don't have to go any further then same thing if you're gonna do the other side
},
{
    409.68,413.4
     you're gonna extend the head tilt to that side and
},
{
    415.88,421.64
     You can like I said a little pressure if you want it. Yeah, typically it's the arm that's not involved because
},
{
    421.84,425.88
     The other one's gonna hurt and it kind of gets in the way. Now this is the opposite of this.
},
{
    425.88,428.8
     This is, this is once you check out,
},
{
    428.8,432.28
     see if you get relief from a position.
},
{
    432.28,436.0
     So let's say I'm having pain in this arm here.
},
{
    436.0,438.4
     I'm gonna put it on a pillow and support it.
},
{
    438.4,440.44
     And I'm gonna tilt away.
},
{
    440.44,442.6
     And now I'm opening the holes up here.
},
{
    442.6,445.16
     There's plenty of room now for the nerve to come through.
},
{
    445.16,446.56
     It's being supported.
},
{
    446.56,448.96
     And does this give you pain relief?
},
{
    448.96,452.48
     Well, if it does, then you may have a nerve issue.
},
{
    452.48,455.56
     And that's actually a lot of times
},
{
    455.56,457.48
     with people that have nerve problems,
},
{
    457.48,460.32
     I actually have them use a pill all the time.
},
{
    460.32,463.08
     Because it provides some relief,
},
{
    463.08,464.6
     even if it's a shoulder problem too.
},
{
    464.6,465.8
     Exactly. Now that one if it's a shoulder problem too. Exactly.
},
{
    465.8,468.96
     Now that one, it's possible,
},
{
    468.96,470.8
     if I got a patient and they do this
},
{
    470.8,472.68
     and it hurts down here,
},
{
    472.68,475.04
     or this sometimes that way it'll pinch it more,
},
{
    475.04,476.8
     but you know if it's a bulging disc,
},
{
    476.8,479.0
     that might actually push it out a little bit too.
},
{
    479.0,481.8
     It might, it could make it worse,
