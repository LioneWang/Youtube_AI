     Hi, if you are struggling with back pain, I'm sure that your friends or your family
},
{
    5.76,12.04
     or loved ones have actually advised you to strengthen your glutes. My name is Jasper,
},
{
    12.04,16.84
     I'm a chiropractor at Forlum Chiropractic Clinic and Milton Chiropractic Clinic. Our
},
{
    16.84,21.3
     clinics are located on the outskirts of Bereson-Edmonds and Cambridge and today I want to show
},
{
    21.3,25.4
     you a top tip on how to isolate and strengthen your glutes.
},
{
    25.4,30.6
     And what the exercise we're going to demonstrate to you is actually called the cook hip lift.
},
{
    30.6,34.0
     So what you need to do, you just need a tennis ball for that.
},
{
    34.0,45.86
     You go lay on your back, place the tennis ball on the bottom of your ribs, pull this leg towards you,
},
{
    45.86,47.92
     place the other leg flat on the floor,
},
{
    47.92,50.68
     foot flat, so don't support yourself on your heel
},
{
    50.68,52.88
     or your toe, flat on the floor.
},
{
    52.88,54.96
     Make sure the ball doesn't move,
},
{
    54.96,56.04
     so you keep the ball here,
},
{
    56.04,58.16
     and now you pull yourself,
},
{
    58.16,59.92
     push yourself up like that,
},
{
    59.92,63.08
     and that is an isolated exercise,
},
{
    63.08,63.96
     purely for the glutes.
},
{
    63.96,64.88
     And what you're doing now
},
{
    64.88,70.12
     is you're taking out the hamstrings, I take out the lower back. If you activate the
},
{
    70.12,73.92
     lower back and try to push yourself up this way what will happen is you arch
},
{
    73.92,77.84
     your back, the ball will come out and you know you're doing it wrong, you're not
},
{
    77.84,82.92
     just using your glutes but also your lower back. So this ball comes here, hold
},
{
    82.92,86.0
     it, hold that ball there, purely for your glutes.
},
{
    86.0,89.6
     Fantastic. Now you can get a cramp in your hamstring.
},
{
    89.6,91.8
     That means the hamstring is still a little bit overactive.
},
{
    91.8,94.6
     So just don't lift your pelvis up and high.
},
{
    94.6,98.0
     Just go down a little bit like that.
},
{
    98.0,104.2
     Brilliant. So if you know someone who's struggling with the back pain,
},
{
    104.2,106.46
     show them this exercise, share
},
{
    106.46,107.46
     it with them.
},
{
    107.46,112.5
     There is a comment section below here, below the video, if you have any questions or queries,
},
{
    112.5,115.6
     put them in there and I will answer them for you very shortly.
},
{
    115.6,117.66
     Good luck with the exercise and hope to see you soon.
