     Bob and Brad, the two most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    8.8,12.24
     Howdy folks, I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist, Brad Heineck physical therapist
},
{
    12.24,15.76
     Together we are the most famous physical therapists on the internet and our opinion of course Bob
},
{
    15.76,18.52
     Lonnie's having trouble with the timer. All right today Brad
},
{
    18.52,24.42
     We're gonna talk about the top 10 cervical herniation disc exercises, right and stretches maybe we can see it
},
{
    24.42,25.68
     Right, right cervical herniation disc exercises and stretches maybe we can see.
},
{
    30.68,30.88
     And this is kind of a progression. Right, we're gonna give you 10 different options.
},
{
    37.58,37.64
     You're gonna work with them if it doesn't show immediate relief or after two or three repetitions
},
{
    41.88,47.04
     You should stop, you know if it seems like it's making it worse or hurting go to the next one. Yeah, the key to these Brad is that isn't it that you have to find the movement that's going to take away your
},
{
    47.04,51.24
     pain, make it you know stop going down the arm or whatever. If you got a neck
},
{
    51.24,55.72
     problem it goes into the shoulder a lot of times it'll go into the to this neck
},
{
    55.72,60.48
     will refer to the shoulder blade area and then progress down into the arm so
},
{
    60.48,64.48
     you can go all the way into the hand. Right all the way down so depending you
},
{
    64.48,69.32
     may have it to the hand or just to the shoulder and I have people coming with shoulder pain and find out
},
{
    69.32,71.84
     It's from their neck. We're not gonna give the back too much
},
{
    71.84,77.96
     Ideally you want to start getting that pain to go out of the hand first or forearm first or up here first
},
{
    77.96,81.7
     Exactly and start going up into here and maybe even feel a little more intense up here
},
{
    81.96,89.6
     And then eventually go away. So we're gonna refer to that asizing, if we say centralizing that means it's going up to the neck where it belongs, the center.
},
{
    90.08,97.12
     All right, so we're looking at a herniated disc in the neck and so if we can look at the neck there's just
},
{
    97.52,106.96
     simply seven vertebra up there. Right. And the disc up here are quite a bit smaller than the big beefy disc down in the lumbar,
},
{
    106.96,111.52
     so there isn't as much to herniate, but they can get in the wrong place and start pinching the
},
{
    111.52,115.76
     spinal nerves and when these nerves get the peripheral nerves, when they get pinched,
},
{
    115.76,120.96
     that's when the pain, the numbness, the tingling refers down the shoulder and into their hand.
},
{
    121.92,125.92
     So we've got to unpinch those nerves basically so that's what these stretches are
},
{
    126.88,134.0
     designed to do. Exactly. All right start off with the first one, huh Brad? Yep, this is kind of the go to
},
{
    134.72,139.2
     just see how things respond. Oh by the way if you are new to our channel please take a second to
},
{
    139.2,143.52
     subscribe to us we got subscription buttons over here or down below we provide videos on how to
},
{
    143.52,145.82
     stay healthy fit pain-free and we upload every day
},
{
    145.82,150.88
     There you go back to it Brad. So the first one chin tucks make sure you're up with good posture in your chair
},
{
    150.88,154.32
     You're not gonna do it like this. We need to be up like this and
},
{
    155.0,158.26
     Bob will show you from the front. I'll show you from the side and
},
{
    158.84,165.76
     You'll do chin tucks like this. You're not going chin down, right? not going chin up, you're just backing the car up here.
},
{
    166.48,170.48
     That's a good way to put them. If you want to call your head a car, you're backing the car up.
},
{
    171.68,177.36
     Again, when you're doing this, if the pain centralizes going more up the arm or towards the back of
},
{
    177.36,183.04
     the neck, then that's a good sign. That's one exercise you can work with. If it gets worse,
},
{
    183.04,186.56
     you actually may have to do it a different way. Exactly, go on
},
{
    186.56,192.24
     the next one. We've got nine more to go. The next one, you need a chair that has a back rest that
},
{
    192.24,198.32
     goes about to mid-back. It should not come up to here or to the head because you're going to actually
},
{
    198.32,210.16
     do a little bit of a chin tuck and then start to go back like this and you're actually gonna lean up over the chair Yeah, it provides you a support there. Exactly. Now I found a lot of people with her needed this
},
{
    210.8,214.24
     I'll have them start doing this so get the butt to here and say yeah, all of that hurts
},
{
    215.04,221.2
     And then you don't do that one. That's very typical or we tell them to work within that range. Right, exactly
},
{
    221.68,225.76
     Just start by doing a short extension and then eventually go further and further.
},
{
    225.76,229.68
     A lot of times what I'll do is I'll go right to our next number. Number three.
},
{
    229.68,237.4
     Yep, and I'll take a tall roll and I'll roll it up. If the person is really tender and they don't have much movement
},
{
    237.4,244.04
     I'll get a thicker tall roll and they're more comfortable and I'll say do this don't pull real hard, but just snug.
},
{
    244.36,247.56
     Give your neck some support. And then oh yeah, that feels better
},
{
    247.56,251.6
     You go back farther and with repetition by the third or fourth one
},
{
    251.6,253.16
     Oh that's going better yet
},
{
    253.16,259.0
     And if that's the situation, you know, you're right on this is something you want want to do with a tie on by the way
},
{
    259.0,261.0
     Yeah, I just lose collar
},
{
    261.0,265.38
     Exactly take these ties off and open up your collar, do it with a t-shirt on works great
},
{
    265.38,266.98
     Right, you know
},
{
    266.98,272.54
     So as you get more range of motion you get thinner and I'll bobble do it oftentimes
},
{
    272.76,276.46
     You probably go right away with what's the name of the edge of the towel Bob?
},
{
    277.68,279.12
     Shelfage
},
{
    279.12,284.9
     Shelfage of the towel, but you take the towel and I like that also because you can get more specific
},
{
    284.9,289.06
     Right, the problem that it tends to catch on the shoulders
},
{
    289.06,293.04
     So you got to lift it up off the shoulders. It's kind of nice to have a second person
},
{
    293.36,298.86
     And I'm gonna go it's usually low in the neck because that's usually where a lot of the herniations are C6
},
{
    299.36,304.52
     5 6 and there I can feel pressure right at about C6 right there
},
{
    304.52,308.76
     I'll even bring it up this way Brad and it goes along with the right
},
{
    308.96,310.76
     So I'll do it this way
},
{
    310.76,316.82
     I'll do it this way too if it works like Bob was saying so you can see your thumbs and you got that rabbit ear thing
},
{
    316.82,323.1
     Right make little rabbit ears like this. Oh, yeah. Oh sure watch the rabbit ears. Yeah, so there's little rabbit ears
},
{
    323.72,328.88
     I like that the other thing Brad that I often do like let's say that the pain is going down this arm
},
{
    328.88,336.22
     I'll have them just grab at the right arm then. Right because that just bothers it. Yeah, good point. So if you have
},
{
    336.8,342.72
     Bad shoulders and that's not possible that you just cannot do that. Right and that's as a therapist
},
{
    342.72,345.24
     I'll do it for them. Sure. You know, I've done that too.
},
{
    345.24,347.24
     Yep, okay. They have their shoulders.
},
{
    347.48,353.48
     You know at this point Brad, we might want to say too, if it just seems like we you can't get into extension
},
{
    353.48,359.44
     And it's not helping. It's not making the pain get better. Right. Sometimes we do have you bend to the side of the pain. Sure.
},
{
    359.44,366.0
     You bet. So as we face you here, let's say the pain is going down this arm So you first do a chin tuck
},
{
    366.0,371.44
     Again a couple chin tucks and then now you're gonna try to put your right ear down onto your shoulder
},
{
    371.44,377.28
     And this has been one that I'll tell you this is the one that helps me and this is the one I had a dentist
},
{
    377.92,383.16
     Who you know was always bent one way right and and he found out this is the one that took it
},
{
    383.16,385.28
     It took it right out of the hand out of the arm
},
{
    385.44,388.1
     And he started feeling it more up here and eventually it went away
},
{
    388.18,394.9
     So chin tuck to the right side bend, maybe a chin tuck left side bend, whichever one starts to take the pain away
},
{
    395.4,398.66
     Usually if it's the right arm you're gonna go to the right, but not always
},
{
    398.84,400.84
     Almost most cases, sure
},
{
    401.72,407.2
     The one thing I want to make very clear is do not force these. You're going to do these
},
{
    407.2,412.0
     exercises gently, you can repeat them and if things aren't getting better within four to five
},
{
    412.0,417.04
     repetitions it's not the right thing. Don't think that if I pull harder, if I do something harder
},
{
    417.04,421.76
     and force to it it's going to pop and let go because that's not the case. This takes a while
},
{
    421.76,425.66
     and you might have to do this for a couple days before you see them Right, right
},
{
    425.66,431.42
     And the next thing if I don't get any good results in the seated position, we'll try laying down
},
{
    431.42,435.02
     Yeah, especially when people are really sensitive and everything's firing them up
},
{
    435.02,436.54
     Right, exactly
},
{
    436.54,440.44
     And you need to do this on a firm surface, a bed's not gonna work
},
{
    440.44,444.44
     A carpeted floor works good, if you have a plinth at home like this that's good
},
{
    444.44,445.04
     Ba ha ha, who has a plinth at home like this, that's good
},
{
    451.2,451.76
     Who has a plinth at home? Do you roll up a towel at all? Yeah, I'll do that sometimes yep, but
},
{
    454.32,455.36
     You know if they're comfortable laying like this
},
{
    459.36,463.04
     And then I'll ask them where is the symptoms of an arrhythm? Oh, my fingers are still tingling Then I'll have them start to do some chin tucks like this. So I'm trying to touch
},
{
    463.04,466.7
     I say touch the back of your neck with this part of your head
},
{
    466.7,470.62
     touching, right there, push that down.
},
{
    470.62,472.18
     That's what's kind of in the way there, Brad.
},
{
    472.18,473.74
     Oh, yeah.
},
{
    473.74,475.62
     Oh, those are my magnetic cheaters, Bob.
},
{
    475.62,476.54
     Yeah. Okay.
},
{
    477.54,478.7
     But sometimes what we were talking about,
},
{
    478.7,480.62
     sometimes I put a towel like that too
},
{
    480.62,482.58
     and have them do chin tucks that way too.
},
{
    482.58,486.52
     Yep, and that actually gives you a little more range of motion.
},
{
    486.52,488.56
     And if you do this and all of a sudden your hand,
},
{
    488.56,491.16
     the tinkling and numbness starts leaving your hand,
},
{
    491.16,493.68
     boy you are gold because things are on the right.
},
{
    493.68,496.08
     I often even put this arm just to get it
},
{
    496.08,497.24
     in a little bit of a position Brad.
},
{
    497.24,499.0
     I'll put it under a pillow like that.
},
{
    499.0,499.84
     Good.
},
{
    499.84,501.8
     So, all right.
},
{
    501.8,504.7
     Now, if that's not working,
},
{
    505.24,508.48
     we're giving you lots of options here. This is another option
},
{
    510.12,514.42
     Actually as a therapist I go to a different option, but that's not an option if you're by yourself
},
{
    514.6,517.68
     Where's that towel roll? Yeah, this one
},
{
    517.68,524.52
     I do like to have a thick towel roll because it offers more support because you're gonna go off the end of the bed and
},
{
    525.08,529.42
     You're gonna gently go down and you're only gonna do this one
},
{
    529.42,535.16
     If when you do this it feels better if you do this and you get back and it feels stuck and it hurts and
},
{
    535.28,541.34
     Everything is getting worse just skip it this one you need to feel comfortable with this like
},
{
    542.2,544.82
     Like Bob ducked before it can be real helpful
},
{
    544.82,546.16
     I've had like let's say
},
{
    546.16,549.32
     again this is the painful arm sometimes I've had them take their hand and do
},
{
    549.32,553.36
     that or even take this hand and put it underneath their head brand without the
},
{
    553.36,557.52
     towel and just lower it down. That's one lady I had that this is the long one that
},
{
    557.52,568.2
     would work for her. Okay great. She could work it that way. Okay then you're into the prone position? Right yeah this is
},
{
    568.2,572.36
     the watching TV position because I know when I was a kid this is how I used to
},
{
    572.36,580.56
     watch TV back in the old days not anymore. So you want to get TV repairmen. Yeah neck
},
{
    580.56,586.74
     extension like this so if you just take your you can take your thumbs like this right under your chin
},
{
    587.06,588.74
     And go like this
},
{
    588.74,592.18
     Again, it's the same movement. It's just in a different position
},
{
    592.18,596.18
     I think Bob this one I've only used with people that things are getting pretty good already
},
{
    596.5,599.5
     Sure, that's out of the hand and they got pretty good range of motion
},
{
    599.5,604.14
     They can do it in a seated position and we're still trying to get all the symptoms to go away
},
{
    604.14,609.56
     I agree then this is towards the end of the treatment, usually not the first day for sure
},
{
    611.24,614.54
     So if you get stuck you might try traction is that what you're saying?
},
{
    614.54,618.56
     Exactly Bob and we're just going to show you two examples of traction
},
{
    618.86,620.36
     one is
},
{
    620.36,622.36
     very inexpensive and
},
{
    622.88,624.88
     It's called over the door
},
{
    624.44,625.04
     It's very inexpensive and it's called over the door
},
{
    631.56,634.84
     Obviously this is not on the door, but this is what the unit look like. They're cost about $20 online. We're gonna demonstrate this next week Yeah, we're gonna go through this and you just have a weight here
},
{
    634.84,637.56
     You have a bladder full of some water it pulls down and
},
{
    638.56,641.8
     I've got it locked up in here get it on the free mode and
},
{
    643.16,645.28
     This I'm not gonna take the time to go into
},
{
    645.28,648.68
     it now but the head actually goes in here and it's comfortable is on your chin
},
{
    648.68,652.48
     in your head and it pulls up and it literally gives your neck some traction
},
{
    652.48,658.56
     and that can be very comfortable. The next step is there's more than one model
},
{
    658.56,665.96
     but this is one I like. Well he leaves the camera I'll just do a little song and dance.
},
{
    665.96,668.72
     But this is the Saunders home unit.
},
{
    668.72,669.72
     These are nice.
},
{
    669.72,672.76
     These are really nice.
},
{
    672.76,675.04
     The price is not too bad.
},
{
    675.04,680.48
     If they work and they have you avoid a surgery, it's worth the three or four hundred dollars
},
{
    680.48,681.48
     to buy one of these.
},
{
    681.48,686.96
     And again we're going to do a video on both of these units for some detail because it's gonna take me
},
{
    686.96,691.82
     You know at least five or ten minutes between each one to show you how to use these but they're two good options
},
{
    691.82,693.82
     And plus that gets us to ten, right?
},
{
    693.82,695.82
     We hit ten
},
{
    695.82,697.82
     Alright
},
{
    697.82,703.98
     We're not just pretty yeah, we're pretty ugly but look at this, oh yeah, that's right. Yeah, we're helping everyone
},
{
    703.98,705.2
     So alright, thanks for watching ugly but this helpful oh yeah that's right yeah we're helping everyone so all
},
{
    705.2,708.52
     right thanks for watching
},
