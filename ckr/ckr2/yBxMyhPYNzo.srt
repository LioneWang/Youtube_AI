     This video is all about how to fix a pinched nerve in your neck. If you are
},
{
    6.72,11.44
     struggling with like severe neck pain and even a pain in your shoulder, your arm,
},
{
    11.44,15.88
     your forearm even in your hand, a weakness in your arm, your forearm even in your hand,
},
{
    15.88,20.76
     a tingling or even a numbness in the same area, you're most likely suffering
},
{
    20.76,24.96
     from a pinched nerve in your neck. So what I'm going to do in this video is I'm
},
{
    24.96,28.0
     going to share some really effective exercises to reduce and to get
},
{
    28.0,33.08
     rid of the pinching nerve in your neck but I'm also going to share three really
},
{
    33.08,37.52
     effective stretching exercises from the nerves that run from your neck to your
},
{
    37.52,42.12
     fingers and by stretching these nerves in a particular way you can reduce the
},
{
    42.12,45.36
     symptoms in your arms as well. Okay, let's get started.
},
{
    54.56,60.0
     So the first exercise we're going to demonstrate to you is a fantastic exercise to remove the
},
{
    60.0,65.04
     pinching nerve in your neck and they're called Mackenzie exercises and there are
},
{
    65.04,68.52
     three stages to this exercise so just bear with me I'll go through stage one
},
{
    68.52,72.36
     two and three and you move on through the stages as they get as they get easier
},
{
    72.36,75.52
     and less painful. So the first thing you need to do stage one is you need to sit
},
{
    75.52,78.6
     upright and squeeze them shoulder blades together that's the first thing. Squeeze
},
{
    78.6,82.04
     shoulder blades together sit upright and then you need to create a double chin so
},
{
    82.04,89.76
     keep your eye on the horizontal and create a double chin and you can use two fingers to push your chin in. So that's all you're doing here. You hold this for
},
{
    89.76,96.24
     about five seconds and you repeat ten times. So sit upright, important, create a double chin,
},
{
    96.24,101.84
     push your fingers in, hold this for about five seconds and repeat ten times. So if that goes,
},
{
    101.84,109.18
     so you're allowed to feel a little bit of a local pain in your neck, absolutely fine, but you shouldn't feel the pain in the arm. Okay. The second stage,
},
{
    109.18,112.86
     that goes, well, you move on to the second stage. And the initial bit is the same. So
},
{
    112.86,117.26
     you sit upright, squeeze your shoulder blades together. Which two fingers, put your chin
},
{
    117.26,123.06
     in, hold this. And then what you do is you tilt your head backwards, and you hold this
},
{
    123.06,128.48
     for about one to two seconds. and you come back and sit upright.
},
{
    128.48,135.12
     Yes, you do 10 repetitions. So, squeeze your shoulder blades in, double chin, tilt your head backwards,
},
{
    135.12,141.52
     hold this for one to two seconds, come back up and sit upright. And again, you're allowed to have a
},
{
    141.52,145.2
     little bit of a pain in your neck but you shouldn't feel the pain in the arm.
},
{
    145.2,151.2
     And if that goes well, you move on to the third stage of this exercise, which is, again, combining one and two.
},
{
    151.2,156.7
     So, sitting upright, shoulders together, create a double chin, tilt your head back.
},
{
    156.7,160.2
     And then what we do is we move ahead an inch to the left and the right.
},
{
    160.2,162.9
     So, we do this and this, yeah?
},
{
    162.9,165.68
     And we hold this just for a few seconds we do
},
{
    165.68,170.98
     five repetitions left five repetitions right and we come back to the middle
},
{
    170.98,174.76
     again yeah and again you're allowed to feel again a local pain in the neck so
},
{
    174.76,179.44
     you sit upright you squeeze your shoulder blades together create a double chin tilt
},
{
    179.44,183.48
     your head backwards and then literally go a little bit to the left and a little
},
{
    183.48,189.24
     bit to the right just say no essentially you're saying no and sitting upright and you're allowed to
},
{
    189.24,193.48
     feel again a little bit of a pain. So this is the first stage of getting rid of
},
{
    193.48,199.32
     the pinched nerve in your neck. So if you are next to neck pain, also experiencing
},
{
    199.32,205.68
     like a pain, a numbness, a weakness or tingling in the arm or the upper arm, the forearm and or
},
{
    205.68,210.84
     the hand, then most likely you've also trapped a nerve and what we need to do is
},
{
    210.84,215.36
     we need to stretch those nerves to reduce the symptoms in your arm and these
},
{
    215.36,218.96
     next exercises are going to be very very beneficial for you. Now you've got
},
{
    218.96,222.68
     essentially three nerves that run from your neck to your arm that's the
},
{
    222.68,225.4
     median nerve, the ulnar nerve, the oral nerve and
},
{
    225.4,230.68
     the radial nerve. And I'm going to demonstrate stretches for each of these nerves. And you
},
{
    230.68,235.32
     need to just find which is the most beneficial for you. Just follow me with all these stretches
},
{
    235.32,239.64
     and find out which one works best for you. The first one we're going to demonstrate is
},
{
    239.64,244.8
     the medial nerve. So stretching the medial nerve. What we need to do is stand upright,
},
{
    244.8,246.56
     straighten your arm out to the side.
},
{
    246.56,248.64
     I've got a straight elbow and straight wrist
},
{
    248.64,251.04
     and straight hand, and make sure you depress your shoulder
},
{
    251.04,252.6
     a bit, so make sure your shoulder keeps down
},
{
    252.6,253.6
     so you can keep it down yourself,
},
{
    253.6,255.2
     or you can push it with your other hand
},
{
    255.2,257.72
     and keep it down on the side that way.
},
{
    257.72,260.2
     The first thing you need to do now is move your fingers
},
{
    260.2,262.04
     and your wrist, bend your wrist and move your fingers
},
{
    262.04,264.16
     towards the floor.
},
{
    264.16,269.28
     If this goes well, as in you can deal with this and you don't have too many symptoms in your arm, your forearm or your
},
{
    269.28,276.08
     hand, what you need to do is now move your hand and your arm backwards a little bit. Same thing,
},
{
    276.08,280.48
     if you can still deal with it now, you need to now make sure, see I've always had my fingers
},
{
    280.48,288.44
     pointed towards the floor and now I'm going to move my arm back and down a bit. Always keep your fingers pointing towards the floor and make sure
},
{
    288.44,293.08
     your wrist is still the back as far as you can. If this all goes well now what
},
{
    293.08,297.32
     you can do is you can tilt your left ear to your left shoulder. So now you're
},
{
    297.32,301.32
     really stretching out that medial nerve and what you need to do next is you
},
{
    301.32,306.08
     need to floss the nerve. So flossing the nerve, you can achieve by either moving your head back
},
{
    306.08,310.28
     in the middle again and tilting your head to the left side,
},
{
    310.28,316.88
     or keep your head to the left side here and bend and extend the elbow.
},
{
    316.88,321.0
     All you can do is keep your head in the same place, your elbow in the same place,
},
{
    321.0,324.72
     and just bend and extend the wrist and the fingers.
},
{
    324.72,325.24
     Always make sure the fingers the wrist and the fingers. Always make sure
},
{
    325.24,329.64
     the fingers are pointing towards the floor. So you do 10 repetitions of this one and that
},
{
    329.64,334.24
     can give you the symptoms in your hand but it should reduce it over time.
},
{
    334.24,338.88
     So the second nerve stretch I'm going to demonstrate to you is a stretch for a nerve which is called
},
{
    338.88,346.06
     the ulma nerve and if you pinch this nerve you have pain, weakness, numbness or tingling in either again
},
{
    346.06,351.68
     the upper arm forearm, but especially to these two fingers, your ring finger and your pinky.
},
{
    351.68,356.8
     Often people have like a numbness or a lack of sensation in these fingers when this nerve
},
{
    356.8,357.8
     is pinched.
},
{
    357.8,360.1
     So let me demonstrate the stretch for you.
},
{
    360.1,362.76
     What you need to do first of all is make an okay sign.
},
{
    362.76,366.18
     So place your index finger on top of your thumb.
},
{
    366.18,368.78
     Then you need to put your arm to the side.
},
{
    368.78,370.7
     Yeah, move your elbow back.
},
{
    370.7,373.1
     And now what you need to do is you need to turn the hand
},
{
    373.1,375.82
     around, make sure the fingers face towards the floor
},
{
    375.82,379.66
     and place your little finger just behind your ear.
},
{
    379.66,382.58
     So you place your little finger just behind your ear.
},
{
    382.58,384.5
     Make sure your fingers are pointing down.
},
{
    384.5,388.82
     Now you need to push your elbow back a little bit, this will give you a stretch.
},
{
    388.82,392.82
     And to top it all off what you can do is now tilt your left ear to your left
},
{
    392.82,397.84
     shoulder. Now this is a great stretch for the ulnar nerve and again we need to
},
{
    397.84,403.78
     floss it so what we can do is again move our head backwards and forwards to get
},
{
    403.78,406.28
     the floss, a floss this nerve,
},
{
    406.28,407.8
     or we move that to the side
},
{
    407.8,410.08
     and we push our elbow backwards and forwards
},
{
    410.96,413.88
     to get this nerve flossing.
},
{
    413.88,416.56
     So again, you repeat this about 10 times.
},
{
    416.56,418.68
     It can give you some symptoms again in the arm,
},
{
    418.68,420.72
     especially in the fingers as well,
},
{
    420.72,422.04
     but if you do this daily,
},
{
    422.04,423.96
     this should definitely reduce the symptoms
},
{
    423.96,425.36
     in your forearm and your hand as well. So you do this daily this should definitely reduce the symptoms in your forearm
},
{
    425.36,427.76
     and your hand as well.
},
{
    427.76,432.24
     So the final nerve stretch I'm going to demonstrate to you is a stretch of a nerve called the
},
{
    432.24,437.28
     radio nerve and if you have an impingement in this nerve what you get is you get some
},
{
    437.28,444.56
     weakness some tingling some numbness or some pain in the shoulder the upper arm often in
},
{
    444.56,447.44
     the outside of your elbow your forearm often in the outside of your elbow, your forearm and then
},
{
    447.44,449.16
     the back of your hand.
},
{
    449.16,451.96
     Okay, let me demonstrate how you can stretch this enough.
},
{
    451.96,457.64
     So first thing you need to do is again, stand upright, place your arm towards the side,
},
{
    457.64,461.64
     make sure your shoulder stays down, hand palm is facing down.
},
{
    461.64,466.04
     If this goes well now, you move the hand palm away from you, so I'm turning
},
{
    466.04,472.0
     my hand palm facing away from me. If this now goes well, I'm bending the wrist. If this
},
{
    472.0,476.92
     goes well, as I'm not getting too many symptoms and I can still deal with it now, is I'm now
},
{
    476.92,482.32
     going to move my arm backwards. And if this goes well, what you need to do now is move
},
{
    482.32,488.3
     your arm down. But this is important next bit. You need to turn the fingers away from you like that.
},
{
    488.3,491.2
     So you turn your arm inwards, your fingers move away from you.
},
{
    491.2,493.2
     Keep your elbow straight at all time.
},
{
    493.2,496.4
     And I have about a 30 degree angle here, what we call AB duct.
},
{
    496.4,497.6
     So the arm away from you.
},
{
    497.6,500.1
     So this is about 45, about 30 degrees there.
},
{
    500.1,507.68
     So now you see you hold this stretch here and to accentuate the stretch even more, what you can do is tilt your left ear to your left shoulder.
},
{
    507.68,511.76
     So now you do this. This is a great stretch for the radial nerve.
},
{
    511.76,519.76
     And if you want to floss the nerve, what you do now is either you bring your head back and forwards and floss the nerve through the groove,
},
{
    519.76,526.36
     or you keep your head tilting left and you can bend and straighten the elbow.
},
{
    526.36,527.2
     Yeah.
},
{
    527.2,529.8
     And again, you do this about 10 times,
},
{
    529.8,531.52
     repeat about three times in this daily
},
{
    531.52,533.4
     and this will help to decrease the symptoms
},
{
    533.4,537.28
     in your forearm, in your elbow forearm and your hand.
},
{
    538.16,540.88
     I hope you found out a value in this video
