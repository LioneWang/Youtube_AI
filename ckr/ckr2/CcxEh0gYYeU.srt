     suffering a cardiac arrest. If the person does not respond to you when you speak to them whilst holding their hand
},
{
    30.5,35.56
     and gently shaking their shoulders, call for help if you're alone and lay them on their
},
{
    35.56,36.56
     back.
},
{
    36.56,40.48
     Check their breathing by placing one hand on their forehead and the fingers of the other
},
{
    40.48,43.88
     hand under the tip of their chin.
},
{
    43.88,49.76
     Carefully tilt their head backwards and lift their chin so as to fully open their airways.
},
{
    49.76,55.12
     If you see or hear no respiratory movements, nor feel any breath in your cheek, then the
},
{
    55.12,58.52
     casualty is not breathing.
},
{
    58.52,60.54
     Call the emergency services.
},
{
    60.54,63.76
     Ask someone else present at the scene to bring in defibrillator.
},
{
    63.76,68.6
     While awaiting the emergency services, expose the casualty's chest and begin chest compressions
},
{
    68.6,72.6
     by pressing down on the centre of their chest at a rate of 2 per second.
},
{
    72.6,79.0
     If you're alone, do not perform any chest compressions, but go and find a defibrillator if there is one nearby.
},
{
    82.6,87.24
     Once the defibrillator has been brought to the casualty, turn it on and follow the instructions
},
{
    87.24,90.52
     that it gives, or that come with it.
},
{
    90.52,95.04
     Take out the electrode paddles from their packaging, remove their protective film and
},
{
    95.04,100.44
     place each electrode as illustrated in the diagram, included on the packaging or on the
},
{
    100.44,119.6
     electrode itself.
},
{
    122.36,124.12
     Make sure that nobody is in contact with the casualty while the defibrillator's analyzing
},
{
    124.12,129.44
     the casualty's heart rhythm. Follow the instructions of the device which will indicate whether you should
},
{
    129.44,138.44
     administer a shock or continue with chest compressions. Continue in this way until the emergency services
},
{
    138.44,146.08
     can take over or until the casualty begins breathing normally again.
},
{
    150.08,154.8
     This device can even be used on children and infants. Normally with a special adapter or using pediatric electrodes.
},
{
    154.8,158.28
     If the absence of these adapters or special electrodes,
},
{
    158.28,160.64
     an adult defibrillator can be used.
},
{
    160.64,162.72
     Place one electrode on the chest
},
{
    162.72,165.0
     and the other on the back at the level of the chest.
},
