    0.0,16.34
     Okay, so what we're going to work on is memory right now.
},
{
    16.34,20.58
     So what we're going to do is we're going to match just the colors and the correct number
},
{
    20.58,21.74
     with the color.
},
{
    21.74,23.82
     Okay, color and number.
},
{
    23.82,26.0
     Don't worry about the suit. Okay?
},
{
    26.0,29.0
     Alright. You ready?
},
{
    35.0,39.0
     So I got a guess. You got a guess? And then just remember where everything is.
},
{
    39.0,42.0
     Oh. That's pure luck.
},
{
    42.0,45.28
     Alright. Keep on going.
},
{
    55.68,56.0
     Nice.
},
{
    61.6,65.72
     This brings up the difficulty. Okay? Everything is not in line.
},
{
    65.72,69.72
     There's more cards and you have to try and remember exactly where everything is.
},
{
    69.72,70.72
     Okay?
},
{
    70.72,72.12
     All right?
},
{
    72.12,75.48
     Let me know if you can reach that one you need to get up here over here.
},
{
    75.48,77.48
     Okay?
},
{
    77.48,79.48
     Good?
},
{
    79.48,83.24
     Oh, no kidding.
},
{
    83.24,90.0
     Yep. You can stack them and put them on the side.
},
{
    90.0,134.88
     Beautiful. You're memory is definitely improved. Yeah, do you remember what the rule was?
},
{
    134.88,139.36
     Oh, yes.
},
{
    139.36,172.0
     Okay, so only flip them, you can't move them. Good.
},
