     Music Hello, and welcome to the University Health Network.

     Today, I'm going to be teaching you about two leg exercises to do while you're in bed.
},
{
    47.5,49.7
     Hello Mr. Santos, how are you today?
},
{
    49.7,50.7
     Well thank you.
},
{
    50.7,51.7
     Good.
},
{
    51.7,55.4
     My name's Amanda and I'm a physiotherapist on the unit and today I'm going to be teaching
},
{
    55.4,58.3
     you two leg exercises to do while you're in bed.
},
{
    58.3,60.5
     Nice to meet you Amanda.
},
{
    60.5,67.0
     The first exercise is called ankle pumping. To do this exercise you must move your ankles up and down.
},
{
    67.0,72.38
     Should I do them one at a time or together?
},
{
    72.38,74.38
     Whichever you prefer.
},
{
    74.38,75.38
     Good.
},
{
    75.38,79.86
     Now try the other side.
},
{
    79.86,85.0
     I'll try them together.
},
{
    85.0,87.92
     Good.
},
{
    87.92,93.2
     We suggest that you do this exercise 10 times every hour to maintain the circulation in
},
{
    93.2,96.56
     your legs and prevent blood clots from forming.
},
{
    96.56,100.26
     I can get clots.
},
{
    100.26,108.0
     When you're in bed, the circulation slows down, so by keeping the legs moving, it prevents these blood clots from forming.
},
{
    108.0,114.0
     Okay, so I'll do this exercise 10 times once an hour while I'm in bed.
},
{
    114.0,118.0
     That's right. The second exercise is called knee bends.
},
{
    118.0,124.0
     To do this exercise, what I'd like you to do is bring your knee up towards your chest and back down again.
},
{
    124.0,127.0
     Now for this one, you can alternate your legs.
},
{
    127.0,129.0
     Okay.
},
{
    129.0,131.0
     That far up?
},
{
    131.0,133.0
     Perfect.
},
{
    136.0,138.0
     Good.
},
{
    138.0,140.0
     Now for this exercise, the same thing applies.
},
{
    140.0,144.0
     I'd like you to do it ten times every hour while you're in bed.
},
{
    144.0,147.16
     Okay. Ten times an hour while I'm in bed.
},
{
    147.16,149.08
     In addition to the ankle pumps.
},
{
    149.08,150.08
     Okay.
},
{
    150.08,152.84
     Do you have any questions?
},
{
    152.84,154.8
     Should I do them together?
},
{
    154.8,157.68
     Like do the ankle pumps are then the knee bends?
},
{
    157.68,158.68
     That's a good idea.
},
{
    158.68,160.84
     I think it's easier to keep track of them that way.
},
{
    160.84,165.28
     So you can do your 10 ankle pumps and then your 10 knee bends every hour.
},
{
    165.28,175.58
     Okay, that sounds good. Thank you Amanda. You're welcome.
},
{
    175.58,180.22
     Leg exercises are important to do consistently while you're in bed after you've had your
