     There's a bunch of different tools and techniques that people use to clean their ears, from high
},
{
    3.94,6.92
     tech to low tech and everything in between.
},
{
    6.92,10.36
     If you've got the urge to purge your ear canal but don't know where to start or what
},
{
    10.36,17.68
     to try, then this video is for you.
},
{
    17.68,21.84
     Lucky for you, I won't be giving any medical advice today because I've got a real ear,
},
{
    21.84,31.24
     nose and throat doctor to do that for me. Because wax consistency for everybody is different and the scenario that causes that individual
},
{
    31.24,36.64
     to have wax build up is also different, that not every mode of treatment is going to work
},
{
    36.64,37.64
     for everybody.
},
{
    37.64,41.08
     Before we get into the different techniques, there are some people who probably should
},
{
    41.08,44.68
     not be attempting to clean their own ears with some of these tools.
},
{
    44.68,50.76
     Diabetics, also people that are on blood thinners, and also as people get older, their blood
},
{
    50.76,51.76
     is thinner.
},
{
    51.76,56.92
     That's another person that I would be very mindful of not doing these techniques because
},
{
    56.92,61.56
     if you do get a cut in the ear, it's going to take longer to stop bleeding, will likely
},
{
    61.56,66.08
     fill the ear canal with blood and create problems with hearing.
},
{
    66.08,71.16
     Dr. Silvers told me that cuts inside the ear are the most common type of ear injury she
},
{
    71.16,76.24
     sees associated with cleaning. So whatever method you choose, be gentle and proceed at
},
{
    76.24,81.08
     your own risk. If you want to skip ahead to hear about a specific product, I'll put some
},
{
    81.08,86.4
     timestamps in the description. Now let's get right into it with the controversial
},
{
    86.4,94.0
     cotton swab. It's advised not to use them in general because Q-tips can cause damage if they're
},
{
    94.0,100.08
     pushed in too far. The glands that make wax tend to be in the outer third of the canal. And so
},
{
    100.08,105.94
     typically when we as ear, nose and throat or primary care see wax that's been pushed
},
{
    105.94,111.08
     down to the level of the eardrum, then we know that somebody's been using Q-tips and
},
{
    111.08,112.76
     pushing wax in.
},
{
    112.76,118.82
     I've had two patients in my 22 year history of practicing answer the telephone with a
},
{
    118.82,124.52
     Q-tip in their ear and cause significant trauma to the eardrum and the bones in the middle
},
{
    124.52,125.0
     ear.
},
{
    125.0,127.0
     The cotton tip could also come off
},
{
    127.0,129.0
     and get lodged in your ear,
},
{
    129.0,131.0
     which does not sound like fun.
},
{
    131.0,133.0
     I will tell you personally, I use Q-tips.
},
{
    133.0,136.0
     I use them on an almost daily basis.
},
{
    136.0,138.0
     I'm ultra careful when I use them,
},
{
    138.0,140.0
     and it's just in general my advice,
},
{
    140.0,142.0
     that if you do use them, you want to be careful.
},
{
    142.0,144.0
     Obviously not walking around with a Q-tip
},
{
    144.0,151.28
     sticking out of your ear ear because people can forget. And if you are a wax builder, if you tend to build up a
},
{
    151.28,157.92
     lot of ear wax, you should not use them because all you're going to do is act to force wax in further.
},
{
    157.92,163.28
     Another much discussed yet controversial technique is called ear candling.
},
{
    163.28,167.6
     Ear candling involves placing hollow candles in the ear and lighting them.
},
{
    167.6,172.28
     Proponents of the technique say it warms up ear wax and creates a vacuum that pulls it
},
{
    172.28,173.6
     out of the ear.
},
{
    173.6,178.92
     However, numerous medical studies cast doubt on these claims and the FDA has warned consumers
},
{
    178.92,187.76
     to steer clear of products being labeled as ear candles. I see people that fail the candle that have, for example,
},
{
    187.8,190.64
     wax left behind from ear candle.
},
{
    190.64,193.36
     Now, when you search for ear cleaning kits online,
},
{
    193.36,196.32
     debrox often comes up and claims to be, quote,
},
{
    196.32,199.04
     number one doctor and pharmacist recommended.
},
{
    199.04,201.72
     Debrox is basically hydrogen peroxide,
},
{
    201.72,205.28
     and it's something that many of us to use in our offices. For
},
{
    205.28,209.72
     example, if I have a patient who has difficult wax to remove, I'll either put
},
{
    209.72,215.8
     hydrogen peroxide or mineral oil in the patient's ear to soften the wax to make
},
{
    215.8,221.2
     it easier to either flush out or suction out. For people that do tend to build
},
{
    221.2,226.9
     wax, there are kits that you can buy. These things are readily available over the counter.
},
{
    226.9,230.66
     My only advice is to proceed with caution.
},
{
    230.66,232.22
     If you're searching for ear cleaning kits,
},
{
    232.22,235.54
     you'll also probably see a variety of spray bottles
},
{
    235.54,238.88
     with attachments meant for irrigation.
},
{
    240.46,241.62
     I'm sorry about that one.
},
{
    241.62,243.82
     Certainly there are times that I'll have my nurse
},
{
    243.82,246.44
     irrigate somebody's ear in the office.
},
{
    246.44,249.32
     I just again, also caution,
},
{
    249.32,251.92
     because the angle of the canal
},
{
    251.92,254.04
     can be different for different people.
},
{
    254.04,256.3
     Also, if the ear feels clogged
},
{
    256.3,257.76
     and it's not a wax problem
},
{
    257.76,260.68
     and you go flushing water into the ear,
},
{
    260.68,263.04
     you need to be mindful and be careful.
},
{
    263.04,266.32
     Again, there's certainly a risk to rupture the eardrum. So we just wanna be mindful of that. So I always tell patients to be mindful and be careful. Again, there is certainly a risk to rupture the eardrum.
},
{
    266.32,268.08
     So we just want to be mindful of that.
},
{
    268.08,269.62
     So I always tell patients to be gentle.
},
{
    269.62,272.12
     And if you feel pain, obviously you need to stop.
},
{
    272.12,273.4
     Putting anything in the ear,
},
{
    273.4,276.84
     you can scratch the ear canal and that can cause bleeding.
},
{
    276.84,278.56
     And then of course you get a scab.
},
{
    278.56,280.72
     Now you can't hear because your ear is clogged
},
{
    280.72,284.28
     with some blood and a scab that takes a while to heal.
},
{
    284.28,289.68
     There's also these things that sort of look like screws with detachable tips.
},
{
    290.04,294.64
     So for that type of a thing, the consistency of the wax is key.
},
{
    295.28,300.76
     If it's wet wax, there's no amount of screwing that's going to pull it out.
},
{
    301.16,306.52
     If it's a harder piece of wax, you just want to be mindful that act is actually
},
{
    306.52,312.66
     a pushing motion and can actually push the wax in further. So personally, I would probably
},
{
    312.66,318.26
     shy against that. But again, and I can't say this enough, if people have something that
},
{
    318.26,324.0
     works and works well, and is not causing them any problems, and as soon as they do it, they
},
{
    324.0,325.08
     feel better.
},
{
    325.08,327.52
     It's hard for anyone to discourage that.
},
{
    327.52,329.72
     Lastly, you've got your high-tech cleaning kits
},
{
    329.72,331.16
     with multiple attachments.
},
{
    331.16,333.52
     Some even have cameras on the end.
},
{
    333.52,336.4
     You know, it's challenging enough to teach a clinician
},
{
    336.4,339.24
     to be able to clean ears.
},
{
    339.24,340.8
     I just, again, I caution.
},
{
    340.8,342.56
     I just caution to be careful.
},
{
    342.56,345.24
     The ear canal itself is about an inch in length.
},
{
    345.24,348.92
     Most people are careful not to push things
},
{
    348.92,351.12
     in their ears too far.
},
{
    351.12,354.32
     That's just my only caution that I would recommend.
},
{
    354.32,356.8
     Of course, if you're having a medical situation,
},
{
    356.8,359.76
     it's always advisable to speak to a medical professional
},
{
    359.76,362.2
     to help you determine the best course of action
},
{
    362.2,363.8
     for your specific needs.
},
{
    363.8,371.0
     And getting an exam with somebody who has a wax problem by an ENT or even an otologist, someone
},
{
    371.0,375.84
     who just deals with ears, just to make sure that ears are fine, you don't have a chronic
},
{
    375.84,379.92
     condition that needs to be managed with any kind of medication.
},
{
    379.92,388.26
     I also say if patients need wax removed on an annual basis, you know, going to the right person to have your ears clean
},
{
    388.26,391.72
     instead of trying all these things on your own,
},
{
    392.58,395.96
     you know, it's probably overall easier and quicker
},
{
    396.96,399.64
     than getting a lot of things over the counter
},
{
    399.64,402.28
     and trying these new varieties of things.
},
{
    402.28,403.84
     By the same token, if it's a problem
},
{
    403.84,406.04
     that happens every three months, every six months,
},
{
    406.04,410.52
     obviously that's a little bit more difficult to be going to the doctors frequently.
},
{
    410.52,415.68
     And those patients, sometimes I do recommend putting some deb rocks in two or three times
},
{
    415.68,422.24
     a week to keep the wax off, to let it try to drain on its own so we can hopefully delay
},
{
    422.24,425.16
     the amount of visits that patients need to commit.
},
