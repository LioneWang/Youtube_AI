     Hey guys, Dr. Christianis, physical therapist, certified strength and
},
{
    4.2,8.72
     conditioning specialist and nutritionist. And today I want to go over with you
},
{
    8.72,14.28
     the best exercises you can do if you've got knee arthritis to help reduce some of
},
{
    14.28,18.72
     that pain. Now sometimes you're stuck in your house, sometimes you just don't want
},
{
    18.72,22.12
     to have surgery, it's not practical, you don't want to do it for whatever reason.
},
{
    22.12,26.2
     There are some things that you can actually do to make that pain better.
},
{
    26.2,31.68
     Now typically arthritis gets bad because the bone surfaces start to rub together.
},
{
    31.68,33.44
     We can't fix that.
},
{
    33.44,39.92
     But what happens when that occurs is that you start to lose mobility in the kneecap,
},
{
    39.92,46.24
     in this bone down here called the tibia, and also some range of motion.
},
{
    46.24,49.4
     So the muscles start to get tightened, the tendons start to get tightened, and those
},
{
    49.4,51.76
     are all things that you can work on.
},
{
    51.76,55.8
     So the very first thing to know is that motion is lotion.
},
{
    55.8,58.8
     Just repeat that to yourself over and over again.
},
{
    58.8,64.92
     So if you happen to have a job where you sit a lot, or you just sit a lot anyways, what
},
{
    64.92,69.24
     you want to do, at least every half hour is try to get a little bit of mobility.
},
{
    69.24,72.36
     So if you've got some, and actually it's good to do with both sides anyway, so even just
},
{
    72.36,78.54
     little leg kickouts are a great way to get a little bit of blood flow going in there.
},
{
    78.54,82.92
     You can do little pull-up parts either without a band or with a band.
},
{
    82.92,86.12
     And then even adding a little bit of a hamstring stretch
},
{
    86.12,88.88
     in there, notice I'm bringing my chest forward.
},
{
    88.88,91.8
     So these are all great things to do seated.
},
{
    91.8,93.96
     Another one would be a little bit of a march.
},
{
    93.96,95.4
     So again, every half hour trying to do
},
{
    95.4,97.54
     five or 10 repetitions of something
},
{
    97.54,100.4
     to keep that fluid moving so things don't get stuck.
},
{
    100.4,103.12
     You probably notice that if you've been sitting for a while
},
{
    103.12,104.44
     or if you've been lying down for awhile,
},
{
    104.44,107.26
     you go to get up and it's like, like oh super-duper stiffness, right?
},
{
    107.26,112.42
     So that is what we're trying to prevent and then the other thing to do when you're sitting
},
{
    112.58,116.34
     I'm gonna pull up my derma edge. This is actually an invention that I created
},
{
    116.94,120.32
     And it is available on my website, but if you try to get in there
},
{
    121.62,123.98
     And you're gonna go either up or down depending on which direction
},
{
    124.8,129.0
     there and you're gonna go either up or down depending on which direction feels like you got a little bit more bumpy. Through the calf, the adductor, that
},
{
    129.0,134.08
     groin inner thigh muscle, the quad and even the hamstring. And all you're doing
},
{
    134.08,137.16
     you're just going do a little test see which way feels bumpier go in that
},
{
    137.16,142.08
     direction it's a very gentle motion and what you're doing is getting that fluid
},
{
    142.08,146.2
     unstuck so that those layers glide together a little bit better.
},
{
    146.2,149.8
     And you can even add a little range of motion afterwards, do a little can-can.
},
{
    149.8,155.3
     From there, I'm going to get down onto the ground.
},
{
    155.3,163.5
     So usually where people struggle is that knee, switch to this leg, knee flexion or knee extension.
},
{
    163.5,166.66
     Usually people are kind of stuck up like this and they have a hard time getting that knee
},
{
    166.66,168.12
     bent all the way.
},
{
    168.12,172.4
     So what we're going to do, what you're going to do is take a little towel, roll it up.
},
{
    172.4,174.92
     I'm going to lie right down on my back.
},
{
    174.92,177.44
     I'm going to place this underneath that knee.
},
{
    177.44,181.64
     Now what this is going to do is help to gap that knee joint so it actually moves a little
},
{
    181.64,182.72
     bit better.
},
{
    182.72,187.8
     So if this is as far as you can go, you stop stop there if you can apply a little pressure to that knee you
},
{
    187.8,192.2
     Go ahead and do so hold for about five or ten seconds and then let it relax
},
{
    192.2,199.32
     You can bring it a little closer. These are not supposed to hurt. Okay. Just remember that be gentle with your body. That's important
},
{
    200.12,202.12
     from there
},
{
    202.2,205.0
     You can do this next one either on the ground
},
{
    205.0,206.28
     or if you're sitting on a chair,
},
{
    206.28,208.84
     you can put your leg up on another chair.
},
{
    208.84,210.88
     I'm gonna use the same towel roll though
},
{
    210.88,213.48
     so that I can elevate my foot a little bit.
},
{
    213.48,215.36
     And so usually what I see is this, right?
},
{
    215.36,218.2
     This flexion in that knee.
},
{
    218.2,219.88
     So we're gonna help to move that.
},
{
    219.88,221.96
     So I am gonna take a sheet.
},
{
    221.96,224.24
     You can take a strap, a sheet, a belt,
},
{
    224.24,226.0
     and I'm just gonna pull it to the side so you can see it.
},
{
    226.0,230.4
     I'm going to pull up on that foot at the same time that I'm pressing down
},
{
    230.88,232.88
     right above that kneecap.
},
{
    233.24,235.24
     My knee goes nice and straight because I
},
{
    235.72,239.12
     don't have knee arthritis, but a lot of times you'll kind of stop here.
},
{
    239.12,245.58
     And again, you want to do this nice and gentle, so push down as much as you can as you're pulling up on that foot and then let it go.
},
{
    245.58,248.72
     Pull and push at the same time.
},
{
    248.72,253.04
     You can still get benefit even if you don't do the little pull with it, but I like that
},
{
    253.04,256.6
     because then you're stretching the calf out too, which tends to get tight with all of
},
{
    256.6,258.44
     this stuff.
},
{
    258.44,264.28
     Now the other issue I tend to see is some tightness in the hip and some weakness in the
},
{
    264.28,267.6
     hip. I'm going to go onto my side here.
},
{
    267.6,270.72
     This is my favorite one for strengthening up these side muscles.
},
{
    270.72,271.96
     Go right onto your side.
},
{
    271.96,274.92
     When you look down, you'll know you're in the right position if you can see your toes
},
{
    274.92,277.6
     and a little bit of your feet, but not the whole leg.
},
{
    277.6,280.16
     So here would be way too far forward.
},
{
    280.16,281.68
     Here's the right spot.
},
{
    281.68,284.48
     Lift it a little bit away from that floor.
},
{
    284.48,286.04
     And then I'm going to just lift that top leg.
},
{
    286.04,287.96
     And I'm aiming for the heel so that I really know
},
{
    287.96,291.64
     that I'm using this versus these front muscles.
},
{
    291.64,292.96
     And I'm just gonna back up a touch
},
{
    292.96,295.64
     so you can see my foot there a little better
},
{
    296.52,297.88
     in my fabulous socks.
},
{
    299.32,302.32
     So shoot for 15 to 20 repetitions of those.
},
{
    303.48,306.16
     And then I'm gonna stand on up again.
},
{
    306.16,307.72
     And we want to stretch that hip flexor out.
},
{
    307.72,311.84
     Now if you've got knee arthritis, this one's usually a little easier to do standing than
},
{
    311.84,313.32
     it is sitting.
},
{
    313.32,316.24
     So I'm going to stretch this hip.
},
{
    316.24,317.24
     This knee is going to bend.
},
{
    317.24,319.04
     I'm going to do a little bit of a pelvic tilt, right?
},
{
    319.04,322.12
     I'm pushing that hip forward and then I'm coming forward.
},
{
    322.12,326.84
     So I'm stretching all of this out. You can, if you've
},
{
    326.84,331.16
     got the flexibility and mobility, put that other foot up on a chair and then add that
},
{
    331.16,334.84
     pelvic tilt in, but sometimes this is a little bit too much. It's great balance work too.
},
{
    334.84,340.92
     See? Gotta stand there and not move. 30 seconds or a minute a few times a day as well, and
},
{
    340.92,344.74
     that is because those muscles actually, at least one of those hip flexor muscles attaches
},
{
    344.74,345.86
     all the way into that knee
},
{
    346.12,349.88
     So stretching the calf where you were doing with the other one is important
},
{
    349.88,353.16
     And then if you want to add a hamstring stretch instead of just the seated one
},
{
    353.92,360.72
     You can do up on a chair and again you can do it lower too. You can do it on a step and then bringing that chest forward
},
{
    361.64,363.64
     Try not to get a moving chair like me
},
{
    364.44,366.34
     There we go. So, did you hear my
},
{
    366.34,371.9
     knee snap a little bit there too? So those are some ways that you can work on fixing
},
{
    371.9,376.78
     your pain yourself. Get the mobility back, get the range of motion back, and then strengthen
},
{
    376.78,381.9
     up everything around it to help you out. So thank you so much for tuning in today. If
