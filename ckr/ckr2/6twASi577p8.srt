     Hello everybody, this is Ms. Fook Fixer. We have Dr Kenny here with a medical issue in
},
{
    31.44,39.52
     his feet. So I'll be treating him but he's going to explain to us what has happened to
},
{
    39.52,48.4
     his feet while I get ready. Hi everyone, I hurt my toe, my little toe. This is the one on my left,
},
{
    48.4,75.0
     so my right toe, I can move it to the side, a lot happens. Up, side, and down, down, down.
},
{
    75.0,82.0
     Yeah, I think I broke my toe, or maybe like the head of my, of my met or something like
},
{
    82.0,91.08
     that, or maybe that tiny little fracture. It's a little bit more swollen than the one on the right. This is already a week ago I think. The one on
},
{
    91.08,95.76
     my right is this one. It's a little bit less swollen and this one is more swollen and I
},
{
    95.76,103.32
     think there's some bruise in there as well and it hurts at the bottom of the foot. Anyone
},
{
    103.32,105.08
     thinks they've broken their toe they should probably
},
{
    105.08,111.36
     go and see a doctor in the NX range and get some advice. I have decided that it is not
},
{
    111.36,122.36
     a fracture, it is not a big one, it is a major fracture. I am vascular in tax by that I mean
},
{
    122.36,127.84
     I have a good blood flow towards the toe. I can feel it absolutely fine.
},
{
    127.84,130.56
     It's just the pain and it's a bit unstable when I walk on it.
},
{
    130.56,132.04
     Like this, when you do this, that hurts.
},
{
    132.04,135.34
     Stop poking my toe.
},
{
    135.34,142.36
     And yes, so I have asked my wife to buddy strap it and to give me a bit of padding and hopefully
},
{
    142.36,153.8
     it'll just hit on its own after a couple of weeks. I do it doing exercise basically. I do a bit of tie boxing and apparently my little toe is not as strong as someone's knee.
},
{
    153.8,165.56
     Who knew? And there you go. And my lovely wife, Miss Foot Fixer, is now going to and to not cause me any pain. Sure.
},
{
    165.56,168.36
     And take my toe together.
},
{
    168.36,169.36
     Sure.
},
{
    169.36,174.32
     So we also take the meds together because he finds that we do really helpful.
},
{
    174.32,177.36
     So we'll do that too and see what happens.
},
{
    177.36,181.64
     Yeah, quite like I'm going to be able to support over the meds when I'm stepping on the ground
},
{
    181.64,182.64
     when I'm going training.
},
{
    182.64,183.64
     So what happened yesterday night?
},
{
    183.64,186.16
     Yesterday night you tried to do it yourself.
},
{
    186.16,186.98
     I did.
},
{
    186.98,188.88
     And then he was like, ah, ah, ah,
},
{
    188.88,190.76
     it's still painful.
},
{
    190.76,192.24
     Because he did it too tight.
},
{
    192.24,193.66
     I did do it too tight, that's true.
},
{
    193.66,197.48
     So when you body strap, you don't want to do it too tight
},
{
    197.48,201.08
     because it can restrict the circulation.
},
{
    201.08,204.04
     And obviously you can cause a lot of pain
},
{
    204.04,207.32
     by compressing onto the area that's injured
},
{
    207.4,211.64
     So you really want kind of just some support. So what I've done here
},
{
    212.48,216.1
     Before anyone asks that is not a fungal nail infection my little toe now
},
{
    216.6,220.1
     It's just a bit years of trauma and I no longer have a little toe now
},
{
    220.64,222.64
     so what I do is make a
},
{
    223.12,227.46
     Little tiny aperture here just to separate the toe access
},
{
    227.46,228.46
     to the foundation.
},
{
    228.46,240.46
     So we're just going to fold this up like that.
},
{
    240.46,242.78
     And Kenny doesn't like it too big.
},
{
    242.78,246.0
     Slide in between. Is that okay? And Kenny doesn't like it too big
},
{
    248.0,248.52
     Slight in between
},
{
    252.56,253.56
     Is that okay? Yes, I love you. I love you too
},
{
    258.8,259.8
     And then what we'll do is we're gonna buddy strap it. So what I'm gonna do is put this on here
},
{
    261.8,264.0
     like that
},
{
    267.76,269.52
     I'll put this like this like that and I'll put this like this, like that, and I'll put this in between the toe.
},
{
    279.52,291.04
     Obviously be super super gentle and then I'm going to body strap his toe to the next one. I'll put this under, kind of like a belt.
},
{
    291.04,313.48
     In between here, be really really gentle. that it's got some space.
},
{
    315.48,359.0
     And then put it over. And what you little tiny piece is doing. Left elevate your foot up very excellent.
},
{
    359.0,361.52
     I liked it when you supported that tape with another tape.
},
{
    361.52,363.88
     Yeah but I'm not going to do that because that's...
},
{
    363.88,366.0
     That's good, otherwise it falls off.
},
{
    366.0,370.0
     I didn't do a... I didn't do a...
},
{
    370.0,372.0
     Double tape last time on the Mets anyways.
},
{
    372.0,373.0
     Yeah are you sure?
},
{
    373.0,374.0
     Yeah.
},
{
    374.0,375.0
     I feel like you did.
},
{
    375.0,376.0
     You always think that I did.
},
{
    376.0,378.0
     You also thought that I didn't put the separate on.
},
{
    378.0,398.4
     But then I did. This is like customers wrapping.
},
{
    398.4,399.4
     So they're okay.
},
{
    399.4,400.4
     Is it too tight?
},
{
    400.4,401.4
     Yeah, it's good.
},
{
    401.4,416.9
     You communicate with me.
},
{
    418.9,422.4
     And then just rip that off. Just lean a little bit forward for me. Excellent.
},
{
    422.4,424.4
     And you cut this off.
},
{
    424.4,426.28
     More well.
},
{
    426.28,427.64
     So that's body strap.
},
{
    427.64,428.92
     Nice.
},
{
    428.92,429.76
     Secure.
},
{
    431.0,431.84
     Does it feel okay?
},
{
    431.84,432.68
     Feels good.
},
{
    432.68,434.28
     And I added a bit of extra tape
},
{
    434.28,437.64
     between the toe body strap and the tape around the mat
},
{
    437.64,439.44
     so that it doesn't come off as easy.
},
{
    442.36,447.0
     Nice, taping it down like that.
},
{
    462.0,463.0
     Perfect. Lovely.
},
{
    463.0,464.0
     There you go.
},
{
    464.0,465.0
     Now I can go training again.
},
{
    465.0,466.0
     You can go training.
},
{
    466.0,467.0
     Awesome.
},
{
    467.0,470.0
     So that's what you do, but it's perhaps very, very easy.
},
{
    470.0,472.0
     Sometimes a bit annoying.
},
{
    472.0,480.0
     And we'll find out what happens to his tail if we need to amputate it in the future.
},
{
    480.0,None
     Thank you very much for watching.
