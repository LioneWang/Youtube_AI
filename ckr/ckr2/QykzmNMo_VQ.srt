     Bob and Brad, the two most famous physical therapists on the internet.
},
{
    10.0,12.0
     Hi, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.
},
{
    12.0,13.0
     Brad Heineck, physical therapist.
},
{
    13.0,15.0
     Together we are the most famous physical therapists on the internet.
},
{
    15.0,16.0
     In our opinion, of course, Bob.
},
{
    16.0,20.0
     Brad, today we're going to talk about just how to choose a knee brace for arthritis or knee pain.
},
{
    20.0,24.0
     This is just a general brace, a good, affordable brace.
},
{
    24.0,29.16
     You can spend hundreds of dollars on braces, especially for us right now.
},
{
    29.16,31.12
     Closer to a thousand in some cases.
},
{
    31.12,36.78
     And those are custom made and they're unloading or offloading braces, but they are very expensive
},
{
    36.78,39.28
     and they're also very bulky.
},
{
    39.28,44.96
     So this is just a good size brace that'll give you, it'll give you, it'll reduce some
},
{
    44.96,45.84
     of the stress on the knee, it'll help with you know, it'll give you some, it'll reduce some of the stress on the knee
},
{
    46.12,49.64
     It'll help with some stability and it'll help with some pain, you know
},
{
    49.64,56.46
     It's as well as hyper extension. Oh, right because they do have braces it. Yeah, I mean now metal hinges
},
{
    57.04,60.96
     So that's lateral as well as hyper extension. Just show that on the skeleton at some point
},
{
    61.72,64.12
     Well, why don't we do that right now? Well, of course Bob
},
{
    66.2,66.32
     skeleton at some point. Why don't we do that right now? Well of course Bob.
},
{
    70.76,76.08
     When we talk about instability as you get arthritis in your knee it kind of throws the joint off. Are you down here Lonnie? You can get lateral movement like
},
{
    76.08,80.72
     this, shaking back and forth this way too forward and back. So if that
},
{
    80.72,85.14
     hinges on there it kind of helps stop that. It helps hold it in place.
},
{
    85.14,86.9
     And if you're, you know, you couldn't,
},
{
    86.9,88.98
     the slang word, bulllegged or knock,
},
{
    88.98,91.26
     need that'll kind of help support that
},
{
    91.26,92.86
     in the proper direction as well.
},
{
    92.86,95.66
     And if you hyper extend, let's turn them sideways.
},
{
    95.66,99.98
     Some people do, and particularly people who have a stroke,
},
{
    99.98,101.82
     sometimes will hyper extend.
},
{
    101.82,103.86
     So with this brace on, it bends,
},
{
    103.86,106.2
     but it does not go the opposite direction.
},
{
    106.2,108.96
     So it'll help minimize that kind of irritation.
},
{
    108.96,113.48
     Yeah, and these braces all come with these hinges in them.
},
{
    113.48,117.12
     You can take them out, especially if you need to wash
},
{
    117.12,119.92
     the brace, which by the way, you're supposed to hand wash them.
},
{
    119.92,120.76
     Sure.
},
{
    120.76,122.2
     And throw them in the washer dryer.
},
{
    122.2,123.88
     And you make sure the Velcro's all locked up.
},
{
    123.88,125.96
     Otherwise that's the problem.
},
{
    125.96,131.48
     Alright, we talked with the good people at BraceAbility.com and I'll put that down below
},
{
    131.48,135.84
     and down in the comments or down in the information down below.
},
{
    135.84,137.92
     And they sent us some braces.
},
{
    137.92,139.82
     They were really kind enough to do so.
},
{
    139.82,140.96
     We liked their braces.
},
{
    140.96,142.16
     That's why we contacted them.
},
{
    142.16,144.48
     They got some really good braces.
},
{
    144.48,150.28
     The other thing that they have, which I really like, is they really have a large range of sizes.
},
{
    150.28,155.88
     They go from small all the way to 6 XL. And that's the problem. A lot of times for people
},
{
    155.88,159.08
     who are a little bit larger, they can't find a brace that fits.
},
{
    159.08,163.48
     Right. You get that bariatric population and that's what we're looking for, something
},
{
    163.48,168.46
     that'll accommodate their legs. So what happens is they can't exercise because they
},
{
    168.46,173.62
     you know the knee hurts and so they gain even more weight. So this is I
},
{
    173.62,180.3
     think a great solution for that. So I think the keys to a good brace is you
},
{
    180.3,186.08
     know having the right fit and comfort. And can you get it on and off easily right good point
},
{
    186.8,192.5
     So this is a wraparound brace up as opposed to the type of sleeve where you pull up and over right
},
{
    192.72,195.16
     And I leave is fine in some instances
},
{
    195.16,199.22
     I'm not going to go against that but that's not what we're advocating right here
},
{
    199.22,202.88
     So here you look at the name so you put the letters up so you can read it
},
{
    202.88,227.8
     That's up on top. Yeah, and goes up. The hole in the back goes behind the knee. Which is by the way a nice feature. Because otherwise it gets bunched up behind the knee. And if you ever wear a brace you can tell. You know that you don't want to have anything butching up. It's irritable and it gets a little hotter. So usually you'd wrap the first top one first or bottom one. I like to do the bottom one first.
},
{
    227.8,232.72
     It's kind of an individual thing. If the taper goes up I find that at the bottom.
},
{
    232.72,241.12
     Anything that goes against Bob I'll do. So put up those first two closures.
},
{
    241.12,246.76
     That's where you want the patella with the kneecap right in the hole there and again
},
{
    246.76,247.64
     That's for comfort
},
{
    247.64,247.82
     Yeah
},
{
    247.82,251.16
     If you if you got one of those braces that you're pulling up over the top of it
},
{
    251.16,256.22
     It's gonna push right on the kneecap again. Those are fine for other certain instances, but in arthritis
},
{
    256.22,259.66
     I think this is probably more appropriate. Sure. So then you have the other two
},
{
    261.92,269.54
     Straps here that you can actually cinch. Yeah, this is what I like about it. I just used this exact same brace yesterday
},
{
    269.54,274.24
     on a stroke patient who has hyper extension
},
{
    274.24,278.0
     instability in the knee and I bet you stopped the hyper extension didn't it?
},
{
    278.0,282.84
     He did very well with it. He walked farther with it. He felt more confident with it.
},
{
    282.84,290.36
     And I'm not just saying that. I bet you aren't just saying that of course not so now you can wear this over the pants too when she's sure
},
{
    290.36,294.92
     Oh, yeah, yeah a lot of people do and or you can slide the pants over it
},
{
    295.12,301.58
     Or you can wear sporty shorts like I do. Yeah, you look hot in those don't we are gonna have the women just
},
{
    302.04,304.04
     commenting on you Bob
},
{
    304.92,306.8
     Elderly 80 year old woman.
},
{
    306.8,307.4
     Of course.
},
{
    307.4,312.04
     Now the material on this is a breathable neoprene alternative.
},
{
    312.04,314.68
     I don't know what that means, but it's not neoprene.
},
{
    314.68,319.92
     Neoprene does tend to be a little bit uncomfortable.
},
{
    319.92,321.92
     And this is supposed to be moisture wicking.
},
{
    321.92,324.24
     So it helps with that.
},
{
    324.24,326.16
     One thing I want to make a point, Brad,
},
{
    326.16,329.04
     you don't need copper and you don't need magnets.
},
{
    329.04,330.72
     There's no, I mean, you laugh,
},
{
    330.72,332.6
     but a lot of people think there's something magical
},
{
    332.6,334.8
     to those and there really is,
},
{
    334.8,337.2
     that the studies haven't held up on those at all.
},
{
    337.2,339.96
     And again, this has the hinges in here.
},
{
    339.96,342.28
     They do remove.
},
{
    342.28,343.84
     Yeah, if you don't like the hinges,
},
{
    343.84,345.72
     you don't need that support, take them out
},
{
    345.72,347.2
     and you can remove them without.
},
{
    347.2,348.12
     That's exactly right.
},
{
    348.12,350.88
     If you don't feel like your knee's not unstable,
},
{
    350.88,351.92
     I would go ahead and take them out
},
{
    351.92,354.2
     and you just got to, on the inside,
},
{
    354.2,355.68
     you'll find a slot where the hinges
},
{
    355.68,357.04
     and you just pull them right out.
},
{
    357.04,361.84
     So, oh, we should talk about how to measure for this, Brad.
},
{
    361.84,362.68
     Okay.
},
{
    362.68,363.92
     So they, very simple.
},
{
    363.92,365.28
     They want two measurements. One, they want right around the for this brand. Okay, so they very simple. They want two measurements.
},
{
    365.28,371.28
     One, they want right around the kneecap itself, you know, with a tape measure. And then you go six
},
{
    371.28,376.96
     inches from the top of the kneecap up and then take another measure right here on the thigh.
},
{
    376.96,382.96
     Let me draw on your leg, Bob. There you go. See how that works? Yeah. So those two spots, you send
},
{
    382.96,387.24
     them in, I mean, you go online and they'll tell you what size
},
{
    387.24,388.24
     then you need.
},
{
    388.24,389.24
     Sure.
},
{
    389.24,392.48
     And again, small all the way to 6XL, so they're going to have your size for you.
},
{
    392.48,395.48
     Very critical to get the right fit on this.
},
{
    395.48,401.08
     This brace, I think they call it the obesity brace, which I'm not thrilled about the name.
},
{
    401.08,404.44
     But anyway, the price is $59.99.
},
{
    404.44,407.2
     So that's a good price. I think that's the same price
},
{
    407.2,413.92
     no matter what size you get. So the good price, give him a visit if you're having some knee pain.
},
{
    414.64,418.32
     This will help you take that pain level down so you can exercise again.
},
{
    418.32,420.0
     Give you that support that you need.
},
{
    420.0,424.72
     Get strong like bull. I took his line. You want to say it Brad?
},
{
    424.72,426.04
     No, no, you didn't roll the R. Strong like bull. I took his line. You want to say it Brad? No, no you didn't roll
},
{
    426.04,432.24
     the arc. Strong like bull. Okay there we go. Here's our bull. Thanks for watching.
},
