     Hey guys, welcome back.
},
{
    6.32,12.0
     Today I'm going to show you some easy ways to manage swelling in the hand.
},
{
    12.0,19.16
     Okay, so the first exercise is going to be a pumping exercise to begin this exercise
},
{
    19.16,20.84
     for swelling.
},
{
    20.84,25.76
     You want to make sure that you're elevating your hand so that your hand is above your
},
{
    25.76,26.76
     elbow.
},
{
    26.76,31.32
     Your elbow is just about the level of your shoulder so that it can circulate back to
},
{
    31.32,35.58
     the heart and the heart can pump everything back out normally.
},
{
    35.58,41.2
     So make sure that your patient is not down here, which is where a lot of people like
},
{
    41.2,42.4
     to be.
},
{
    42.4,43.4
     Get it up here.
},
{
    43.4,44.4
     Okay.
},
{
    44.4,46.56
     For this exercise, there are two parts.
},
{
    46.56,50.04
     Okay. There's going to be part A, which is like a fist
},
{
    50.04,52.72
     and part B, which I like to call a starfish.
},
{
    52.72,57.72
     So part A, bringing the hand up again, elevated position.
},
{
    58.08,59.8
     They're going to spread the fingers wide.
},
{
    59.8,63.56
     They're going to pump into a fist and then opening.
},
{
    63.56,66.84
     This is truly a pumping movement. There is,
},
{
    66.84,70.54
     it's gentle, but it shouldn't be super gentle, you know, like pretend you're squeezing a
},
{
    70.54,81.98
     stress ball. You want to repeat that movement about 10 times. Okay, part B or the starfish,
},
{
    81.98,89.76
     you're going to spread the fingers wide as you can and then squeeze them all together and make sure that you're using all five fingers including the thumb.
},
{
    89.76,91.84
     And again, pumping.
},
{
    91.84,95.96
     Not a super gentle movement but not real aggressive either.
},
{
    95.96,101.48
     And again, repeating 10 times.
},
{
    101.48,106.56
     Another exercise that can be really helpful in managing swelling in your hand and fingers
},
{
    106.56,107.76
     is retrograde massage.
},
{
    107.76,112.96
     It's something that you can do yourself at home and you can educate your patients to
},
{
    112.96,115.84
     be able to do it as well for all the therapists out there.
},
{
    115.84,121.4
     So the key with retrograde massage is that it needs to be really, really light touch.
},
{
    121.4,125.38
     Like imagine that your finger is a butterfly's wing and you're petting a butterfly's wing. It's a super light touch. Like imagine that your finger is a butterfly's wing
},
{
    125.38,127.28
     and you're petting a butterfly's wing.
},
{
    127.28,128.84
     It's a super light touch.
},
{
    128.84,130.6
     It's not gonna be very firm at all.
},
{
    130.6,132.8
     It's not gonna feel like a deep tissue massage.
},
{
    132.8,134.16
     That's not the point.
},
{
    134.16,137.62
     The limb vessels need a very small amount of pressure
},
{
    137.62,140.64
     to move limp fluid or swelling throughout the body
},
{
    140.64,142.28
     and flush it out.
},
{
    142.28,145.76
     So you always wanna have your fingers elevated to start. Like,
},
{
    145.76,150.16
     let's pretend this hand is the swollen one. So you're going to have your fingers elevated.
},
{
    150.16,155.68
     It does usually help if you use a little bit of lotion or some kind of cream on your fingers,
},
{
    155.68,160.88
     just to help get the glide. Your other hand is going to have kind of like a real gentle pincher
},
{
    162.16,165.82
     kind of grasp, right? And what you're're gonna do is you're gonna use that
},
{
    165.82,169.26
     pincer grasp and you're gonna start at the very tip of the finger close to the
},
{
    169.26,174.32
     fingernail and you're just stroking down the sides of the finger nice and gentle
},
{
    174.32,181.84
     super smooth strokes right just kind of going down the sides of the finger you
},
{
    181.84,186.2
     can go up front and back again super light touch, petting the
},
{
    186.2,192.48
     butterfly and just gliding the tissue down. You're gonna do 10 strokes on each
},
{
    192.48,199.84
     finger, okay? And you just kind of keep going, super light touch, not much pressure
},
{
    199.84,208.08
     here, just helping to flush out the swelling of the hand. Okay, so you keep repeating 10 times
},
{
    208.08,214.08
     on each finger. If it's really hard for you to do kind of that one-handed attempt, sometimes I
},
{
    214.08,219.44
     tell people to do kind of like a like lacing your fingers together. So again, you're going to kind of
},
{
    219.44,225.28
     use a real light pressure here and just gliding the fingers down. It's sometimes a little bit easier for some
},
{
    225.28,232.24
     people. Again, super light pressure, you're not squeezing them together, it's just barely touching
},
{
    234.08,242.48
     and gliding the swelling down the hand. Okay, so those are just a couple easy ways to start
},
{
    242.48,245.2
     getting the swelling in your hand under control.
},
{
    245.2,247.6
