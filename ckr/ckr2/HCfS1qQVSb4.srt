},
{
    50.02,60.02
     So how did you develop a blister?
},
{
    60.02,61.9
     Is it running too many miles?
},
{
    61.9,63.12
     Is it barefoot running?
},
{
    63.12,67.48
     Is it a wrong or poor fitting shoe, too small of a shoe,
},
{
    67.48,72.48
     or too cute of a shoe, as in my kids or wives?
},
{
    73.04,75.44
     Just a wife, not wives, just one wife,
},
{
    75.44,76.8
     in case my wife is watching.
},
{
    76.8,78.24
     So let us know in the comment.
},
{
    78.24,79.84
     We love hearing this stuff.
},
{
    79.84,82.68
     We love knowing how to target our videos
},
{
    82.68,84.28
     to help you the most.
},
{
    84.28,86.08
     So help us, we need ya.
},
{
    86.08,88.08
     So blisters can be dangerous.
},
{
    88.08,90.44
     A blister can get infected.
},
{
    90.44,95.1
     It can cause cellulitis and it could put you in the emergency room on IV antibiotics.
},
{
    95.1,97.36
     We see it almost every week.
},
{
    97.36,101.64
     So if you do get a big thick blister, be careful with it.
},
{
    101.64,106.56
     If there's redness, if it's hot, if there's thick, creamy, or milky,
},
{
    106.56,113.68
     like discharge, that is an infection. If you feel nausea, vomiting, chills, if your stomach
},
{
    113.68,119.56
     doesn't feel good, that's an infection. If it feels like something is rubbing too much
},
{
    119.56,124.12
     and you're starting to have a lot of pain, you should not be having a lot of pain at
},
{
    124.12,125.24
     your blister site. You should not be having a lot of pain at your blister site. You should
},
{
    125.24,130.22
     not be having a blister in the first place. Let your podiatrist know. Realistically, in
},
{
    130.22,133.96
     ER, you're going to sit there for 12 hours and they're just going to give you a antibiotic
},
{
    133.96,139.16
     no matter what. It's going to be really expensive for you. Call your primary care doctor or
},
{
    139.16,144.16
     your podiatrist if you're worried. We will get you in early and we will help you, but
},
{
    144.16,146.08
     that's how you go about a blister.
},
{
    146.08,149.12
     Should you pop it at home, I would always say be safe
},
{
    149.12,150.72
     and leave it to a professional.
},
{
    150.72,153.08
     95% of the time, healthy people will be okay,
},
{
    153.08,155.76
     but if you get an infection, it's a big deal
},
{
    155.76,157.2
     and you could really hurt yourself.
},
{
    157.2,161.24
     So number one is if you feel like you're getting a blister,
},
{
    161.24,162.76
     if it's rubbing somewhere in your shoe,
},
{
    162.76,164.28
     stop doing what you're doing.
},
{
    164.28,168.88
     You're probably running too much or you hike too far or you're walking in too
},
{
    168.88,176.4
     cute and too pointy of a dress shoe or a nice high heel. What you want to do is fit your
},
{
    176.4,181.72
     shoe properly. The number one reason people get blisters is the shoe is too small or does
},
{
    181.72,185.72
     not fit properly. Here's what you wanna do to fit your shoe properly.
},
{
    185.72,188.08
     Make sure you're standing with your foot
},
{
    188.08,189.84
     already swollen at the end of the day.
},
{
    189.84,191.92
     From the morning to the end of the day,
},
{
    191.92,193.96
     your shoe size can increase half the size
},
{
    193.96,195.8
     to one full size.
},
{
    195.8,198.76
     Number two, you wanna use our guide
},
{
    198.76,201.28
     and measure your foot properly at home.
},
{
    201.28,209.56
     You wanna make sure the width and the length is Proper because you have different types of feet you have lots of different fitting difficulties
},
{
    210.12,215.2
     That you want to watch in this video and we'll help you fit it so you can order the proper shoe online
},
{
    215.4,217.4
     Or go to the store and be prepared
},
{
    217.92,221.36
     So this video will help. That's reason number one
},
{
    222.08,227.3
     Number two way you want to prevent blisters is you want to get good socks.
},
{
    227.48,234.06
     Look at these. These are moisture wicking socks. A great sock now with compression,
},
{
    234.28,240.04
     with synthetic technology that wicks away your sweat. It's like $5 online for a bunch of these.
},
{
    240.24,242.52
     We have them linked in the show notes.
},
{
    242.56,248.0
     We want to get you good socks that wick away moisture and have you fit properly.
},
{
    248.0,254.4
     So check down in the show notes, but don't go with thick socks that have stitching in
},
{
    254.4,255.4
     the front.
},
{
    255.4,262.24
     You want socks that don't have stitching that wick away your sweat and you want to just
},
{
    262.24,263.8
     get good socks, invest in them.
},
{
    263.8,265.68
     It's maybe like a dollar more. And if you're watching this video because of blisters, just just get good socks, invest in them. It's maybe like a dollar more.
},
{
    265.68,268.08
     And if you're watching this video because of blisters,
},
{
    268.08,270.72
     just get the good socks, you won't regret it.
},
{
    270.72,273.0
     There are great gel pads like this.
},
{
    273.0,276.24
     So see this right here, this will go onto your heel.
},
{
    276.24,278.94
     So simply putting this onto your heel,
},
{
    278.94,281.92
     it will stop heel rubbing in like dress shoes,
},
{
    281.92,283.06
     things like that.
},
{
    283.06,285.84
     There are pads like this that you can put
},
{
    285.84,287.8
     in the back of a tennis shoe.
},
{
    287.8,291.32
     So see, you just pull off the back, it's nice and sticky.
},
{
    291.32,292.24
     See that right there?
},
{
    292.24,293.88
     It stops your heel rubbing.
},
{
    293.88,296.32
     At the same time, if you have heel problems,
},
{
    296.32,298.48
     we have a great video to stop back
},
{
    298.48,300.68
     of the heel blisters right here.
},
{
    300.68,307.6
     If you have big toe joint or bunion blisters, you want to treat your bunions. So we have a great
},
{
    307.6,312.72
     at-home bunion video right here that can help. So I'm going to link that right here.
},
{
    313.36,318.72
     And the next thing is, if it's a ball of the foot problem or an arch problem,
},
{
    318.72,326.28
     you want to get yourself an orthotic. So here's what an orthotic does. Number one, if you don't
},
{
    326.28,330.08
     have an orthotic, look what happens to my foot. So the front's moving around and
},
{
    330.08,334.88
     the heels sliding like this. So watch this again. Every time you step your foot
},
{
    334.88,340.84
     moves, but with an orthotic, look it, it doesn't really move. You don't need an
},
{
    340.84,346.04
     expensive custom orthotic. Look at this. This is like five to ten dollars right here.
},
{
    346.04,350.76
     You could order this right now and have it delivered to your house in like two days and
},
{
    350.76,351.88
     your blisters are gone.
},
{
    351.88,353.72
     Your foot's moving around less.
},
{
    353.72,355.56
     So you want to get a good orthotic.
},
{
    355.56,357.46
     You want to put it in a good shoe.
},
{
    357.46,362.36
     That will really help that micro motion and get rid of your blister.
},
{
    362.36,363.56
     Antibiotic creams.
},
{
    363.56,365.32
     If you have rubbing, if you have blisters
},
{
    365.32,370.0
     starting Neosporin, Triple A Niobot Acquaintment, Silvidine, there's lots of good ones out there.
},
{
    370.0,375.28
     Officially check with your doctor before you use these. Tape. Put a bandaid on your heel
},
{
    375.28,380.88
     or on the toe where the blister is, then put some tape over it. So tape acts like a second
},
{
    380.88,386.42
     skin right here. You put that on the back of your heel and it stops rubbing inside your shoe.
},
{
    386.42,389.32
     See now it's rubbing, it's the tape, it's like armor.
},
{
    389.32,390.44
     And you don't need duct tape,
},
{
    390.44,391.8
     because duct tape's ugly.
},
{
    391.8,393.56
     You can buy more padded tape,
},
{
    393.56,395.72
     so see how much thicker that tape is?
},
{
    395.72,397.4
     That can work really well.
},
{
    397.4,399.28
     There's also athletic tape like this,
},
{
    399.28,401.16
     so hockey tape can work really well.
},
{
    401.16,402.36
     These are great tapes.
},
{
    402.36,409.6
     Before you put on tape though, you wanna grab a bandaid, put some medication on it put the band-aid on top of the blister. After your blister is healed,
},
{
    409.6,415.44
     you want to grab some petroleum jelly. So open this up, grab a nice scoop and just rub it on your
},
{
    415.44,420.48
     skin. That will let you rub. You can put that on top of the duct tape or the tape on your heel so
},
{
    420.48,428.28
     there's less friction. You can put it in between or on top of your toes if you have hammer toes that are rubbing. So there's a lot of different
},
{
    428.28,434.4
     creams. These are petroleum jellies here but you could even grab some deodorant,
},
{
    434.4,439.4
     rub some deodorant on your big toe or the back of your heel. Waxes, there's lots
},
{
    439.4,444.36
     of great waxes out there. There are expensive blister creams, blister tapes.
},
{
    444.36,446.0
     Look at the reviews.
},
{
    446.0,447.36
     We have them linked below.
},
{
    447.36,450.96
     These creams and moisturizing lotions do work really well
},
{
    450.96,452.4
     and they do a great job,
},
{
    452.4,454.6
     but they're not available easily at home.
},
{
    454.6,455.92
     But they work great.
},
{
    455.92,458.56
     Just increase the motion, cracks, dry areas,
},
{
    458.56,460.28
     put lotion on them.
},
{
    460.28,462.16
     On the other hand, if you're too moist,
},
{
    462.16,464.36
     you have to stop yourself from sweating.
},
{
    464.36,468.78
     If you're wearing dress shoes and you're sweating in like a 12 hour work shift, you
},
{
    468.78,472.66
     have to get some moisture wicking socks number one.
},
{
    472.66,478.18
     And number two, you want to get some talcum powder or some corn starch or some anti-sweat
},
{
    478.18,479.18
     powder.
},
{
    479.18,481.02
     There's anti-perspirant sprays.
},
{
    481.02,489.02
     Just like for your armpits right here, you can get some sprays for your feet and again those are linked below but spraying your feet in the
},
{
    489.02,493.98
     morning can really decrease your sweating and that can decrease the rubbing
},
{
    493.98,497.9
     the maceration which means your skin breaking down like you're in a bathtub.
},
{
    497.9,501.98
     This is the sped-up version of how to fit your foot at home. A regular piece of
},
{
    501.98,507.78
     paper doesn't work for me so I'm gonna use a piece of cardboard just because the piece of paper is a little too small unless
},
{
    507.78,512.62
     you go diagonally for some people. Put all your weight on the floor because your foot
},
{
    512.62,517.22
     flattens even more. You can see I'm resting on my other foot here, so I probably should
},
{
    517.22,522.26
     stand on it a little bit more and the foot would be just a little bit wider, just a little
},
{
    522.26,547.6
     bit. So I give it a little bit of extra juice. You always want to be safe when ordering online. Your foot gets just a little bit wider during the day and just a little bit longer. And remember, everybody makes slightly different shoes. So it's always better to go a little bit bigger. So draw out your foot, measure it. It should be an inches if you're in America. Other countries such as Europe may use different sizing measurements,
},
{
    547.6,552.88
     especially if you're in India or Europe and hello to our visitors from those countries.
},
{
    552.88,557.04
     So give it a little bit of extra. See how I gave it a little bit of extra. Then go to a place like
},
{
    557.04,566.52
     zappos.com. They have great calculators, also great shoe store. Check the links below for our favorite links
},
{
    566.52,568.96
     to our favorite Zappos shoes.
},
{
    568.96,571.08
     But measure it, use their guides,
},
{
    571.08,573.76
     and you plug in your numbers for width and length,
},
{
    573.76,575.2
     and you use the sizing charts,
},
{
    575.2,577.2
     and you're in great shape with the numbers we gave you.

    577.2,579.68
