     So, what is a tibial plateau fracture?
},
{
    3.92,8.9
     A fracture or a break in the upper part of the shin bone, the tibia, may be the result
},
{
    8.9,13.8
     of a low impact injury, such as a fall or from a high impact injury, such as a motor
},
{
    13.8,15.46
     vehicle accident.
},
{
    15.46,20.16
     Proper identification and management of these injuries will help to restore limb function,
},
{
    20.16,26.32
     such as strength, motion and stability, and reduce the overall risks of arthritis.
},
{
    26.32,31.46
     The bone comprising the tibial plateau is cancelous, or crunchy, as opposed to the thicker
},
{
    31.46,34.12
     cortical bone of tibial shaft.
},
{
    34.12,39.68
     Whether the injury is treated with surgery or without, both the bony injury or the fracture,
},
{
    39.68,44.16
     and any soft tissue injuries must be treated together.
},
{
    44.16,48.44
     Fractures that involve the upper fourth of the lower leg, or tibia, may or may not involve
},
{
    48.44,50.0
     the knee joint.
},
{
    50.0,54.16
     Fractures that enter the knee joint may render the joint imperfect and the joint surface
},
{
    54.16,55.16
     irregular.
},
{
    55.16,59.12
     Additionally, these fractures may result in improper limb alignment.
},
{
    59.12,64.36
     Either of these factors may contribute to excessive joint wear, which can cause arthritis,
},
{
    64.36,65.36
     instability,
},
{
    65.36,66.92
     and loss of motion.
},
{
    66.92,71.72
     Where a fracture is located within the knee and how much it is displaced is referred to
},
{
    71.72,73.24
     as its pattern.
},
{
    73.24,77.4
     The pattern of a fracture is determined by the force of the injury, in addition to how
},
{
    77.4,80.32
     and where that force is applied to the limb.
},
{
    80.32,83.88
     There are several symptoms of a tibial plateau fracture.
},
{
    83.88,85.28
     Pain when bearing weight,
},
{
    90.0,96.64
     tenseness and swelling around the knee, resulting in the limitation of leg bending, deformity around the knee, pale, cool foot, numbness around the foot, numbness or the
},
{
    96.64,101.92
     feeling of pins and needles within the region of the foot raises concern about whether nerve
},
{
    101.92,105.36
     injury or excessive swelling within the leg has occurred.
},
{
    110.48,116.8
     If these symptoms are present after a fracture, you should have an assessment done in the emergency room as soon as possible. In rare instances, soft tissue swelling may be so severe that it
},
{
    116.8,121.68
     threatens the blood supply to the leg and foot, a condition referred to as compartment syndrome.
},
{
    122.24,127.32
     This may require emergency surgery in which vertical incisions are made to release the
},
{
    127.32,131.52
     skin and muscle coverings, also known as a fasciotomy.
},
{
    131.52,136.62
     These incisions are often left open and then closed, or covered days or weeks later as
},
{
    136.62,140.14
     the soft tissues recover and swelling resolves.
},
{
    140.14,144.84
     If the condition of the soft tissues is such that the application of a cast or splint would
},
{
    144.84,148.22
     be unwise, an external fixator may be considered.
},
{
    148.22,153.76
     With this device, often temporary, pins are inserted above and below the joint.
},
{
    153.76,159.38
     These pins exit the skin and are connected by bars, which stabilize the knee joint.
},
{
    159.38,163.82
     Non-surgical treatment may include restrictions on motion and weight bearing, in addition
},
{
    163.82,168.32
     to the application of external devices devices such as braces or casts.
},
{
    168.32,173.72
     Typically the soft tissues are assessed and x-rays are taken at prescribed intervals.
},
{
    173.72,178.44
     Knee motion and weight bearing begin as the injury and method of treatment allow.
},
{
    178.44,182.48
     If surgical treatment is elected, several devices may be considered.
},
{
    182.48,185.5
     In some cases where the upper one-four fourth of the tibia is broken,
},
{
    185.5,187.5
     but the joint is intact,
},
{
    187.5,190.0
     a rotter plate may be used to stabilize the fracture.
},
{
    190.0,193.5
     A rot is placed in the hollow cavity in the center of the bone,
},
{
    193.5,196.5
     whereas a plate is placed on the external surface of the bone.
},
{
    196.5,200.0
     Plates are commonly used for fractures that enter the joint.
},
{
    200.0,202.5
     If the fracture enters the joint and depresses the bone,
},
{
    202.5,207.0
     lifting the bone fragments may be required to restore joint function.
},
{
    207.0,214.5
     Lifting these fragments, however, creates a defect or hole in the cancellus or crunchy bone of the region.
},
{
    214.5,219.0
     This defect must be filled with material to keep the joint from collapsing.
},
{
    219.0,223.0
     This material can be a bone graft from the patient or from a bone bank.
},
{
    223.0,228.66
     Synthetic or naturally occurring products which stimulate bone healing can also be used.
},
{
    228.66,232.9
     To further stabilize this area, a plate with screws is applied.
},
{
    232.9,237.84
     In some cases, the condition of the soft tissue is so poor that the use of a plate or rod
},
{
    237.84,239.5
     might threaten it further.
},
{
    239.5,246.0
     An external fixator, described under emergency care above, may then be considered as final treatment.
},
{
    246.0,249.04
     The external fixator is removed when the injury is healed.
},
