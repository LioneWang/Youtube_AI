     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.
},
{
    4.26,5.4
     Brad Heineck, physical therapist.
},
{
    5.4,6.72
     We are the most famous physical therapists
},
{
    6.72,7.56
     on the internet.
},
{
    7.56,8.56
     In our opinion, of course, Bob.
},
{
    8.56,9.92
     Today we're gonna talk about nine ways
},
{
    9.92,13.18
     to get relief from osteoarthritis naturally.
},
{
    13.18,14.48
     We're talking about joint pain.
},
{
    14.48,15.4
     Yeah.
},
{
    15.4,16.44
     You're gonna have to forgive us today.
},
{
    16.44,17.96
     We're gonna show you a lot of products,
},
{
    17.96,20.08
     but they're not, they're non-drug.
},
{
    20.08,20.92
     Right.
},
{
    20.92,23.2
     So I think that's the way a lot of people,
},
{
    23.2,25.08
     they don't wanna take drugs if they can avoid it.
},
{
    25.08,25.92
     Right?
},
{
    25.92,28.04

     Go to bobandbrad.com and go to our giveaway section.
},
{
    69.88,72.16
     Or you can also go to Facebook, Bob and Brad.
},
{
    72.16,73.52
     It's always pinned to the top of the page.
},
{
    73.52,74.56
     We'll give you directions.
},
{
    74.56,76.7
     We gotta get your email and stuff like that.
},
{
    76.7,78.36
     So I'm gonna move this out of the way, Brad.
},
{
    78.36,80.24
     And then we'll begin talking about
},
{
    80.24,81.84
     how to relieve that arthritis.
},
{
    81.84,83.2
     Okay, Bob.
},
{
    83.2,86.04
     Let's get rid of some of that aches and pains.
},
{
    86.04,87.12
     Yep, there we go.
},
{
    87.12,91.04
     Okay, so the first thing you wanna make sure you're doing,
},
{
    91.04,93.92
     because we're talking about joints here.
},
{
    93.92,96.76
     And joints have what we call synovial fluid.
},
{
    96.76,98.28
     That's the lubrication of the fluid
},
{
    98.28,100.72
     that keeps them healthy and moving smoothly.
},
{
    100.72,102.44
     I could just set it better myself, Brad.
},
{
    102.44,105.68
     So what happens is if you do keep it moving,
},
{
    105.68,108.64
     that synovial fluid tends to be generated.
},
{
    108.64,109.48
     And-
},
{
    109.48,113.16
     Right, it provides nutrients and makes the joint healthy.
},
{
    113.16,116.2
     So you wanna keep the joints moving as much as possible.
},
{
    116.2,119.88
     Now there is a circumstance where the arthritis gets
},
{
    119.88,122.72
     so bad that you can't move it anymore.
},
{
    122.72,125.4
     But in most cases, you do want to keep it moving.
},
{
    125.4,128.56
     So Brad, you just talk about your hand this morning.
},
{
    128.56,131.28
     It's sore in the morning, a little bit of arthritis.
},
{
    131.28,132.64
     And what's the first thing you do?
},
{
    132.64,133.72
     Get it moving, yep.
},
{
    133.72,135.16
     And it's a little painful at first,
},
{
    135.16,136.72
     but the little more I move it.
},
{
    136.72,139.2
     As a matter of fact, we've got a 92 year old woman
},
{
    139.2,142.04
     who's got such bad knee arthritis, she couldn't walk.
},
{
    142.04,144.2
     So we started to get her moving
},
{
    144.2,146.4
     and now she's walking up to 75 feet.
},
{
    146.4,149.28
     Literally from not walking at all to 75 feet
},
{
    149.28,150.72
     because of motion.
},
{
    150.72,151.56
     Yeah, it's a weird thing.
},
{
    151.56,153.88
     You'd think that resting the joint would help,
},
{
    153.88,155.68
     but it actually makes it worse.
},
{
    155.68,157.8
     So, and that's why a lot of times you wake up in the morning
},
{
    157.8,159.56
     you're so stiff because it hurts.
},
{
    159.56,161.44
     You just doubt, that's what we're gonna show some tricks
},
{
    161.44,163.92
     on how to get through some of that initial pain.
},
{
    163.92,166.84
     Right, the next thing is stretches, believe it or not.
},
{
    166.84,168.96
     We have found, or we have not found,
},
{
    168.96,171.0
     McKenzie kind of discovered this.
},
{
    171.0,172.64
     Like, let's say for example,
},
{
    172.64,174.32
     your knee doesn't straighten out all the way.
},
{
    174.32,175.16
     Sure.
},
{
    175.16,176.1
     Can you bring the chair over here, Brad?
},
{
    176.1,176.94
     Sure, Bob.
},
{
    176.94,178.92
     I was gonna put my leg up.
},
{
    178.92,180.76
     Oh, I thought I could sit down.
},
{
    180.76,181.6
     It's got a back rest.
},
{
    181.6,182.76
     I was just gonna do it like this.
},
{
    182.76,185.36
     Let's say for example, you have the slightest,
},
{
    185.36,187.68
     the knee doesn't straighten out all the way.
},
{
    187.68,191.52
     Regaining that full range of motion
},
{
    191.52,193.84
     often will take stress off the knee.
},
{
    193.84,195.2
     That's hard to believe.
},
{
    195.2,197.72
     Maybe a better example would be the hip, Brad.
},
{
    197.72,200.8
     If you check your hips and you put one leg up like this
},
{
    200.8,202.64
     on your opposite leg,
},
{
    202.64,204.68
     and one knee is up like this,
},
{
    204.68,206.2
     because the hip is tight,
},
{
    206.2,209.0
     and the other knee goes way down, like that.
},
{
    209.0,210.84
     Stretch the one that's tight,
},
{
    210.84,213.6
     especially if it coincides with your hip pain.
},
{
    213.6,216.92
     Give it a stretch, pressure on, pressure off,
},
{
    216.92,219.4
     and you'll find generally over time
},
{
    219.4,221.6
     that that hip starts to feel better.
},
{
    221.6,223.28
     It's really amazing.
},
{
    223.28,226.16
     The more you stretch, you take off the joint, the better.
},
{
    226.16,227.0
     What's next, Bob?
},
{
    227.0,229.28
     Well, the first one is gonna be talking about
},
{
    229.28,230.52
     one of the products that we're gonna mention,
},
{
    230.52,232.2
     and this is infrared heat.
},
{
    232.2,233.84
     The reason we like infrared heat,
},
{
    233.84,234.68
     where is it, Brian?
},
{
    234.68,235.52
     I don't know.
},
{
    235.52,237.68
     They're over here.
},
{
    237.68,239.28
     The reason we like infrared heat,
},
{
    239.28,241.56
     no, you can try any heating pad,
},
{
    241.56,243.3
     but the reason we like infrared heat,
},
{
    243.3,245.72
     because it penetrates much deeper.
},
{
    245.72,248.88
     Regular heat, and we got this symbolized.
},
{
    248.88,250.24
     Is that a word?
},
{
    250.24,252.24
     Well, it shows it right there.
},
{
    252.24,253.32
     Demonstrates it.
},
{
    253.32,256.4
     So regular heat only penetrates this much.
},
{
    256.4,257.4
     Skin deep basically.
},
{
    257.4,259.2
     Skin deep, right.
},
{
    259.2,263.24
     Thermotex infrared heat actually can penetrate
},
{
    263.24,265.0
     2.36 inches, right?
},
{
    265.22,266.72
     That's the blue color right here
},
{
    266.72,268.16
     versus the blue color on that side.
},
{
    268.16,269.68
     You can barely see it there.
},
{
    269.68,272.6
     There, you know, we're gonna get some deeper heat.
},
{
    272.6,274.28
     It takes a little bit longer,
},
{
    274.28,275.8
     but that's just understandable.
},
{
    275.8,276.96
     You're going so much deeper.
},
{
    276.96,278.82
     So what happens in this case, Brad,
},
{
    278.82,280.4
     where he has it on his knee,
},
{
    280.4,283.56
     so you have 2.36 inches on one panel going through
},
{
    283.56,286.68
     half the knee, and you have 2.36 inches going one panel going through half the knee and you have 2.36 inches going through
},
{
    286.68,287.92
     the other half of the knee.
},
{
    287.92,289.92
     You're almost going all the way through the knee joint.
},
{
    289.92,292.24
     Right, so you have your heating pad,
},
{
    292.24,293.96
     you wrap it all the way around
},
{
    293.96,296.88
     and of course you can use the Velcro pad like that.
},
{
    296.88,298.2
     Yeah, it's got a lot of straps that come with it.
},
{
    298.2,299.04
     You do have to plug it in though.
},
{
    299.04,299.88
     Yeah, you gotta plug it in.
},
{
    299.88,301.8
     So there's a six foot cord that goes on there,
},
{
    301.8,303.08
     easy on off.
},
{
    303.08,304.52
     These are really well made.
},
{
    304.52,306.44
     They're commercial duty.
},
{
    306.44,307.92
     Brad and I use these,
},
{
    307.92,309.84
     well I use them even in the summer
},
{
    309.84,311.36
     because my wife's got the air conditioning on,
},
{
    311.36,312.76
     it's cold in our house.
},
{
    312.76,315.12
     But I lean on that thing and just,
},
{
    315.12,317.04
     I just give my back a treat every night.
},
{
    317.04,320.2
     I mean, you know, especially get the upper traps too.
},
{
    320.2,322.4
     I mean, and it comes with straps too,
},
{
    322.4,324.32
     by the way, that you can strap it on
},
{
    324.32,325.72
     and use it while you're working.
},
{
    325.72,327.24
     And I've done that quite often.
},
{
    327.24,328.96
     So this particular, the Platinum model,
},
{
    328.96,330.84
     you can use on ankles, knees,
},
{
    330.84,334.44
     you can use a hip, really any joint in the body, shoulder.
},
{
    334.44,335.28
     So.
},
{
    335.28,337.32
     All right, next one we're gonna talk about Brad is turmeric.
},
{
    337.32,339.0
     And I think, you know, a lot of people,
},
{
    339.0,341.68
     this has become all the rage to a lot of people.
},
{
    341.68,342.52
     Do what you say?
},
{
    342.52,343.36
     Turmeric.
},
{
    343.36,344.4
     Turmeric or turmeric?
},
{
    344.4,345.8
     I think it's turmeric, isn't it? Wow, that's always a people. Do what you say? To Merrick. To a Merrick or to Merrick? I think it's to Merrick, isn't it?
},
{
    345.8,347.36
     Wow, that's always a controversy.
},
{
    347.36,348.2
     Is there a debate?
},
{
    348.2,350.12
     All right, you guys can tell us which way you say it.
},
{
    350.12,351.64
     But it's got a pigment.
},
{
    351.64,353.8
     I'll give you another word, curcumin.
},
{
    353.8,354.64
     Oh.
},
{
    354.64,355.64
     I don't know if that's how you say it or not,
},
{
    355.64,358.76
     but that's what I think is the ingredient
},
{
    358.76,360.28
     that actually helps you.
},
{
    360.28,361.72
     It's an anti-inflammatory.
},
{
    361.72,362.56
     Sure.
},
{
    362.56,365.76
     So, and actually I saw one doctor,
},
{
    365.76,368.44
     the doctor on how we died, that book.
},
{
    368.44,371.12
     He actually mentioned that they found out
},
{
    371.12,372.96
     turmeric was actually more effective
},
{
    372.96,375.72
     for treating rheumatoid arthritis than some medications.
},
{
    375.72,377.64
     So it's a big deal.
},
{
    377.64,380.0
     Matter of fact, we're probably gonna get someone
},
{
    380.0,382.68
     who specializes and knows more about this.
},
{
    382.68,384.0
     And we'll have a guest speaker.
},
{
    384.0,385.12
     Like your pharmacist, you mean?
},
{
    385.12,387.28
     Yep, we got some other people on the line too.
},
{
    387.28,388.52
     Yeah, nutritionists too.
},
{
    388.52,391.8
     So, but the thing I didn't know about, Tamerik,
},
{
    391.8,393.92
     the first time I used it, I took way too much.
},
{
    393.92,397.06
     You're only supposed to take like a fourth teaspoon.
},
{
    397.06,398.96
     I guess this really changes the chemistry
},
{
    398.96,399.96
     of your blood levels and stuff.
},
{
    399.96,401.96
     Like, I mean, you really don't want to take too much.
},
{
    401.96,403.88
     They haven't done studies on how it affects you
},
{
    403.88,404.72
     at high levels.
},
{
    404.72,405.58
     Is that why you're a little off today?
},
{
    405.58,406.58
     Yeah, I'm a little off.
},
{
    406.58,408.68
     So, all right, moving on.
},
{
    408.68,410.8
     Number four, strengthening.
},
{
    410.8,414.18
     It's always good to still keep the stronger the joint is,
},
{
    414.18,416.28
     the less stress there is on the joint.
},
{
    416.28,419.32
     And one way that Brad and I have discovered
},
{
    419.32,422.32
     that really is a great way to gentle strengthening
},
{
    422.32,424.08
     without putting as much stress on the joint
},
{
    424.08,428.56
     is to use strengthening bands or tubes.
},
{
    428.56,430.52
     Right, obviously this is something that,
},
{
    430.52,432.16
     you know, any therapist, we've been using these
},
{
    432.16,433.0
     for 20, 30 years.
},
{
    433.0,433.84
     Oh, we got things in the way here.
},
{
    433.84,436.44
     Oh my goodness, we got obstruction.
},
{
    436.44,437.52
     Let's get rid of those.
},
{
    438.4,439.28
     Okay, how are we doing?
},
{
    439.28,440.28
     Are we like, okay.
},
{
    442.0,443.08
     We're finding Brad.
},
{
    443.08,444.88
     Yeah, yeah.
},
{
    444.88,447.1
     So we got the bands with the handles.
},
{
    447.1,448.18
     These were like really nice.
},
{
    448.18,449.58
     Cause the handles, you know,
},
{
    449.58,454.14
     you got some, a nice soft device to grab onto.
},
{
    454.14,458.38
     And it's nice to have something to hold onto on the wall.
},
{
    458.38,459.62
     And we have our wall anchors.
},
{
    459.62,461.68
     So we'll have that listed down below too.
},
{
    461.68,463.52
     But as a good example here,
},
{
    463.52,464.82
     Brad, your tag is sticking out here.
},
{
    464.82,465.68
     This follows me. Oh, no. But as a good example here, Brad, your tag is sticking out here. This follows me.
},
{
    465.68,468.08
     So as a good example here,
},
{
    468.08,470.24
     I was really having a lot of elbow pain
},
{
    470.24,474.64
     with doing curls with the regular barbell.
},
{
    474.64,478.32
     And so I had to adjust and actually start using these
},
{
    478.32,479.16
     for a while.
},
{
    479.16,480.56
     I actually went back to the barbell now.
},
{
    480.56,481.4
     You did.
},
{
    481.4,483.5
     Because I went through a period of doing this
},
{
    483.5,486.28
     for a couple months and I like it,
},
{
    486.28,488.6
     but I want to go a little heavier weight.
},
{
    488.6,489.94
     So I went back to that,
},
{
    489.94,493.72
     but that allowed me to restrengthen my joint
},
{
    493.72,496.0
     and not have as much pain and so I don't feel it anymore.
},
{
    496.0,497.52
     I'll never go back to the barbell.
},
{
    497.52,498.36
     Yeah, I know.
},
{
    498.36,499.2
     You do both of the bands.
},
{
    499.2,500.04
     I love the bands.
},
{
    500.04,500.88
     I've got a whole system set up
},
{
    500.88,503.4
     and there's nothing better for me.
},
{
    503.4,507.2
     Next one, if you have osteoarthritis
},
{
    507.2,508.16
     and you wanna get some relief,
},
{
    508.16,510.88
     especially in the joints that are weight bearing,
},
{
    510.88,513.92
     you wanna decrease the weight bearing, as simple as that.
},
{
    513.92,515.92
     So when you're walking outside,
},
{
    515.92,518.8
     one, you wanna avoid hills,
},
{
    518.8,520.6
     you wanna avoid stairs even too,
},
{
    520.6,522.64
     you don't wanna overdo them.
},
{
    522.64,524.12
     You wanna maybe try biking,
},
{
    524.12,526.68
     that's one way to decrease weight bearing.
},
{
    526.68,529.2
     You could also use a walking stick or a cane.
},
{
    529.2,530.2
     Yeah, Matt.
},
{
    530.2,533.92
     And you know, one thing I warn people is that they go,
},
{
    533.92,536.04
     well, I'm not going to use a cane, I look old.
},
{
    536.04,539.6
     Well, sometimes it's not a matter of permanent change.
},
{
    539.6,541.48
     Sometimes if you do it just for a while,
},
{
    541.48,543.24
     it calms the arthritis down
},
{
    543.24,546.28
     and then you can go back to walking without a device.
},
{
    546.28,548.16
     That cane's too short for Bob Byer.
},
{
    548.16,553.16
     That says, and by the way, 1.2 to be made is,
},
{
    553.36,555.92
     believe me, it probably looks better to walk with a cane
},
{
    555.92,557.32
     than to walk like this.
},
{
    557.32,558.16
     Right.
},
{
    558.16,559.6
     You know, because you're limping so bad
},
{
    559.6,561.44
     from the arthritis.
},
{
    561.44,563.2
     So it'll probably look a little better to walk
},
{
    563.2,567.02
     with a cane distinguished, like an English gentleman,
},
{
    567.02,569.28
     than trying to, you know, waddle along.
},
{
    569.28,570.44
     Waddle, right.
},
{
    570.44,572.86
     When you waddle, then you put pressure on other joints
},
{
    572.86,575.08
     and it compounds and it causes one problem to another,
},
{
    575.08,576.6
     et cetera, so.
},
{
    576.6,579.18
     All right, this next one I've really benefited from, Brad,
},
{
    579.18,583.8
     is that actually I get pain in my hips a lot of times,
},
{
    583.8,584.8
     especially with running.
},
{
    584.8,585.66
     Sure.
},
{
    585.66,586.5
     I did anyway.
},
{
    586.5,588.72
     And sometimes it would actually throw me off
},
{
    588.72,589.56
     for a couple of months.
},
{
    589.56,591.52
     I'd be like, oh, I'm really limping through this.
},
{
    591.52,593.36
     I was thinking, oh, am I getting hip arthritis?
},
{
    593.36,594.68
     Yeah, getting old.
},
{
    594.68,597.92
     So I started doing massaging the muscles around the joints.
},
{
    597.92,598.76
     Yeah.
},
{
    598.76,599.6
     And I use a-
},
{
    599.6,600.52
     You get your wife to do that?
},
{
    600.52,601.84
     No, no, no, no, no, no.
},
{
    601.84,602.92
     She won't.
},
{
    602.92,604.76
     Brad, this is a family show.
},
{
    604.76,608.96
     So anyway, you can take one of the handheld massagers,
},
{
    608.96,611.56
     the RENFOL massagers, really nice because it's cheap.
},
{
    611.56,612.92
     These are inexpensive, I should say.
},
{
    612.92,614.64
     They're 40 bucks.
},
{
    614.64,616.4
     I mean, man, how can you beat that?
},
{
    616.4,619.28
     So I'm gonna go ahead and turn it on here.
},
{
    619.28,621.96
     But you can go ahead and massage the different areas.
},
{
    621.96,624.24
     You're finding a lot of professional athletes
},
{
    624.24,625.6
     have discovered this now.
},
{
    625.6,628.18
     And that's why they're prolonging their career.
},
{
    628.18,630.32
     We got Tom Brady, quarterback.
},
{
    630.32,634.44
     He's actually a big believer in pliable muscles.
},
{
    634.44,636.36
     And he uses a vibrating foam roller.
},
{
    636.36,638.88
     That's what I actually use a vibrating foam roller.
},
{
    638.88,641.84
     And it's just real quick, but it gets the muscles,
},
{
    641.84,645.6
     they're really ready for running once I get it done.
},
{
    645.6,648.12
     Right, so whether it's the roller or this,
},
{
    648.12,650.6
     you're getting into the muscle and you get it to relax
},
{
    650.6,653.28
     and you're really essentially increasing the circulation.
},
{
    653.28,654.84
     And when you got increased circulation,
},
{
    654.84,656.12
     it's gonna be much healthier.
},
{
    656.12,659.4
     Yeah, you think like, well, why am I massaging the muscles
},
{
    659.4,660.88
     when it's a joint that bothers me?
},
{
    660.88,661.72
     Sure.
},
{
    661.72,662.96
     The muscles go across the joint.
},
{
    662.96,664.16
     And if they're really tight,
},
{
    664.16,666.6
     they're gonna put more pressure on the joint.
},
{
    666.6,670.48
     So the last one Brad, which may be not obvious
},
{
    670.48,673.56
     to a lot of people is that you should get enough sleep.
},
{
    673.56,676.84
     There's, I mean, that's really kind of been a epidemic
},
{
    676.84,679.32
     of lack of sleep in the United States.
},
{
    679.32,681.28
     You know, we talked about this often.
},
{
    681.28,684.56
     It seems to be a badge of courage to not sleep as much.
},
{
    684.56,686.04
     I only get four hours of sleep a night.
},
{
    686.04,686.88
     I only get one.
},
{
    686.88,689.76
     All right, well, I live for years on three hours of sleep.
},
{
    689.76,690.76
     I don't know, I wonder, look at you.
},
{
    690.76,693.16
     Yeah, you look like a hundred years old now.
},
{
    693.16,696.96
     But there's a recuperative nature of sleep.
},
{
    696.96,700.24
     And it's gonna feel better for arthritis
},
{
    700.24,703.0
     and any other element you have.
},
{
    703.0,705.66
     Generally gonna helps what ails you, right?
},
{
    705.66,707.68
     There you go, you really can't go wrong with a little bit
},
{
    707.68,711.0
     of, make sure you get that sleep time taken care of.
},
{
    711.0,713.08
     All right, so sleepy bye and.
},
{
    713.08,714.6
     Oh, we're almost out of time Bob.
},
{
    714.6,716.6
     All right, well thanks for watching folks.
},
