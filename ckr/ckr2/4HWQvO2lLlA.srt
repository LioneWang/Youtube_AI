     Bob and Brad, the two most famous physical therapists
},
{
    6.72,8.04
     on the internet.
},
{
    11.12,13.12
     Howdy folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.
},
{
    13.12,14.44
     Brad Heineck, physical therapist.
},
{
    14.44,15.92
     Here we are, the most famous physical therapists
},
{
    15.92,16.76
     on the internet.
},
{
    16.76,17.8
     In our opinion, of course, Bob.
},
{
    17.8,19.44
     Today we're gonna talk about the best
},
{
    19.44,23.36
     costocondritis self-treatment, no meds.
},
{
    23.36,25.96
     We're gonna have you stop that alarming chest pain.
},
{
    25.96,28.6
     Right, yeah, Bob, and this is something I can attest to
},
{
    28.6,33.76
     because I have colicondritis, didn't know about it for a while
},
{
    33.76,36.32
     and it is alarming when you have chest pain
},
{
    36.32,39.68
     and you have to go to the emergency room to find a way.
},
{
    39.68,42.44
     As I said before, Brad, as we start to develop things,
},
{
    42.44,45.38
     which will be pretty much every week now as we get old,
},
{
    45.38,46.96
     we're gonna go do videos on it.
},
{
    46.96,48.36
     So that's all gonna benefit you.
},
{
    48.36,50.78
     We're gonna figure out how to treat these things,
},
{
    50.78,51.96
     and then we'll pass it on to you.

     All right, good job, Bob.
},
{
    89.76,90.6
     Thank you.
},
{
    90.6,91.44
     Shall we carry on?
},
{
    91.44,92.28
     Let's carry on.
},
{
    92.28,95.56
     All right, costo chondritis, it's a big word.
},
{
    95.56,98.08
     It just means chest pain.
},
{
    98.08,99.66
     But I'm gonna tell you a little bit about it.
},
{
    99.66,102.12
     So once you understand things a little bit
},
{
    102.12,103.76
     with this type of chest pain,
},
{
    103.76,107.92
     it makes it a little more easier and comfortable to treat.
},
{
    107.92,108.84
     And not as scary.
},
{
    108.84,110.72
     Right, exactly.
},
{
    110.72,113.08
     So, costo refers to the ribs,
},
{
    113.08,114.66
     the first part of the name.
},
{
    114.66,117.64
     Chondritis, itis means inflammation.
},
{
    117.64,119.08
     And if we look at Sam,
},
{
    119.08,122.52
     that's why he is here today to assist us.
},
{
    122.52,124.24
     We got the sternum here.
},
{
    124.24,126.4
     We got the white ribs here. We got the white ribs here.
},
{
    126.4,127.52
     We're gonna look at this side
},
{
    127.52,130.88
     because they get the colors out so we're not confused.
},
{
    130.88,133.2
     And then this clear part right in here
},
{
    133.2,135.76
     between the ribs and the sternum,
},
{
    135.76,140.76
     there's actually a joint typically made more of cartilage.
},
{
    140.88,143.4
     But as we age, that can change a little bit
},
{
    143.4,145.76
     and we can actually develop some inflammation,
},
{
    145.76,148.32
     some arthritic changes in there.
},
{
    148.32,151.24
     And when things start moving and irritating that,
},
{
    151.24,153.92
     and get it more inflamed, it creates chest pain,
},
{
    153.92,157.28
     and it can radiate out, not just in this area,
},
{
    157.28,160.32
     but in my case, I feel it radiating on the right side,
},
{
    160.32,163.22
     typically over this way.
},
{
    163.22,164.8
     And it changes your breathing,
},
{
    164.8,166.1
     because if it's bad,
},
{
    166.1,168.02
     you get short of breath because it hurts
},
{
    168.02,169.02
     when you take a deep breath.
},
{
    169.02,172.26
     So your body automatically makes shortness of breath
},
{
    172.26,173.22
     a symptom.
},
{
    173.22,177.34
     So you've got all the classic symptoms of a heart attack.
},
{
    177.34,179.74
     So the first thing you're gonna do if you have symptoms
},
{
    179.74,181.06
     is you're gonna go see a doctor
},
{
    181.06,181.9
     or go to the hospital.
},
{
    181.9,183.06
     Absolutely.
},
{
    183.06,185.12
     Do not think that you're gonna diagnose
},
{
    185.12,186.64
     costochondritis by yourself.
},
{
    186.64,187.48
     Exactly.
},
{
    187.48,188.32
     You gotta go in.
},
{
    188.32,190.16
     You have to go to the,
},
{
    190.16,191.64
     typically the emergency room.
},
{
    191.64,193.68
     You don't have time to go to the doctor
},
{
    193.68,194.76
     and set up an appointment.
},
{
    194.76,195.6
     Right, right.
},
{
    195.6,196.44
     This is not something to take lightly.
},
{
    196.44,197.84
     I know, because I tried that.
},
{
    197.84,199.32
     Yeah, yeah, sure.
},
{
    199.32,201.44
     No, actually the first time what has happened to me
},
{
    201.44,204.12
     at midnight, I woke up with chest pain,
},
{
    206.18,208.8
     not immediately, but after some conversation with my wife,
},
{
    208.8,211.36
     it wasn't too long when we were going to the ER.
},
{
    211.36,212.92
     I was grabbing you by the ear and dragging you.
},
{
    212.92,214.74
     I spent the whole night there.
},
{
    214.74,216.46
     They had me on monitors, blah, blah, blah.
},
{
    216.46,219.26
     The doctor says, your heart's very healthy.
},
{
    219.26,222.54
     You have musculoskeletal symptoms.
},
{
    222.54,224.18
     And I said, well, I'm a physical therapist.
},
{
    224.18,225.72
     Can you fill me in a little more?
},
{
    225.72,229.44
     He said, we don't really know for sure where it is,
},
{
    229.44,230.4
     but it's not your heart.
},
{
    230.4,232.36
     It's musculoskeletal symptoms.
},
{
    232.36,233.2
     You're healthy.
},
{
    233.2,234.12
     You're done with us.
},
{
    234.12,235.24
     Go on.
},
{
    235.24,237.68
     So anyways, his job was to keep me alive,
},
{
    237.68,239.52
     make sure my heart was healthy,
},
{
    239.52,242.34
     not to go through, you know, more detail.
},
{
    242.34,244.64
     So I naturally went into this,
},
{
    244.64,247.14
     looked into it much more thoroughly.
},
{
    247.14,249.98
     But in the meantime, I did go to the doctor three times
},
{
    249.98,253.82
     with chest pain to the ER each time, diagnosed.
},
{
    253.82,255.26
     Because I wanted to make sure,
},
{
    255.26,258.3
     even though I thought I had gastrochondritis,
},
{
    258.3,259.14
     I don't wanna-
},
{
    259.14,259.98
     You hear it?
},
{
    259.98,262.94
     I mean, Brad, I'm glad you give this as an example here
},
{
    262.94,265.78
     because I've heard it many times where people go in
},
{
    265.78,267.52
     and they go, no, your heart's fine.
},
{
    267.52,269.72
     Then they go, they had a heart attack next time.
},
{
    269.72,272.64
     So I think it was very wise for you
},
{
    272.64,274.4
     to check it out for at least three times.
},
{
    274.4,277.74
     And then along with that, I went to my regular doctor,
},
{
    277.74,280.4
     then sent me up with a cardiologist.
},
{
    280.4,284.36
     So I had a very thorough assessment of my heart.
},
{
    284.36,287.04
     Every time I went to continue to say your heart's healthy,
},
{
    287.04,289.44
     we can't find anything wrong with it.
},
{
    289.44,291.6
     It's musculoskeletal.
},
{
    291.6,293.32
     I wish we could say that about your brain.
},
{
    293.32,295.76
     Yeah, well, you know, my wife says that too.
},
{
    295.76,296.6
     Yeah.
},
{
    296.6,297.44
     But anyways, that's a good story.
},
{
    297.44,298.48
     One thing you know about the rib cage, Brad,
},
{
    298.48,300.56
     you know, it's moving up and down.
},
{
    300.56,302.4
     There's a lot of movement in that rib cage.
},
{
    302.4,303.84
     There is, there is.
},
{
    303.84,305.8
     And one way you can test,
},
{
    307.92,310.52
     I had two or three doctors do this to me,
},
{
    310.52,313.56
     they would start palpating right here,
},
{
    313.56,317.16
     right over that area where the costal sternum joints are,
},
{
    317.16,319.6
     and it would never really set me off
},
{
    319.6,322.0
     until the third time I went in,
},
{
    322.0,324.04
     the doctor was doing that and he left
},
{
    324.04,325.08
     and he really didn't find anything, so I'm pushing, and all of doing that and he left and he related and finding it.
},
{
    325.08,327.84
     So I'm pushing and all of a sudden right here
},
{
    327.84,329.84
     about the size of a dime I hit a spot.
},
{
    329.84,330.76
     Wow!
},
{
    330.76,331.6
     You found the spot.
},
{
    331.6,332.44
     I found it.
},
{
    332.44,334.52
     It's like, it's very specific.
},
{
    334.52,337.92
     But you know, the idea is if you push here
},
{
    337.92,340.12
     and it really makes it worse,
},
{
    340.12,344.2
     that's an indication that it could be costochondritis.
},
{
    344.2,345.0
     Now I'm being- Not for sure. Not for sure, but it's an indication that it could be costochondritis. Now I'm being-
},
{
    345.0,345.84
     Not for sure.
},
{
    345.84,348.08
     Not for sure, but it's an indication.
},
{
    348.08,352.08
     So anyways, since that point I can remember
},
{
    352.08,354.76
     I had chest pain outmoing the lawn.
},
{
    354.76,355.6
     Sure.
},
{
    355.6,357.12
     And I'm riding and I've had me going
},
{
    357.12,358.32
     through all the doctor visits,
},
{
    358.32,359.56
     the YAR visits and everything.
},
{
    359.56,363.0
     It's like, man, this has got to be costochondritis.
},
{
    363.0,364.56
     I'm not going in again.
},
{
    364.56,367.12
     I did, it went away, it was fine.
},
{
    367.12,369.08
     It happened to me at night once.
},
{
    369.08,372.62
     And then I started doing some research on my own
},
{
    372.62,374.04
     and I'm looking at some YouTubes
},
{
    374.04,376.92
     and there's some other YouTube therapists
},
{
    376.92,380.72
     that are showing these stretches and stretches like this,
},
{
    380.72,383.12
     breathing, probably good exercise,
},
{
    383.12,384.56
     but they never helped me.
},
{
    384.56,386.9
     As a matter of fact, the stretching, I think,
},
{
    386.9,387.98
     kind of irritated.
},
{
    387.98,388.82
     It could irritate it, yes.
},
{
    388.82,391.76
     Finally, I found a therapist from New Zealand.
},
{
    391.76,392.6
     New Zealand.
},
{
    392.6,396.56
     Steve August, and he has a very thorough video on it,
},
{
    396.56,398.6
     15 minutes long, if you're not a therapist
},
{
    398.6,399.68
     that gets a little boring,
},
{
    399.68,401.48
     because he goes through details
},
{
    401.48,403.68
     about how the problem is back here.
},
{
    403.68,407.76
     Back here, yeah. And it's like, I didn't buy it at first.
},
{
    407.76,409.0
     That doesn't make any sense.
},
{
    409.0,410.34
     I thought it made sense to me right away.
},
{
    410.34,412.32
     Well, of course, but I thought that right.
},
{
    412.32,415.88
     And I kind of did, but I thought I'm always skeptical.
},
{
    415.88,417.04
     You know me, Bob.
},
{
    417.04,419.36
     I never take anything face value until I prove.
},
{
    419.36,420.2
     Make sure you're a therapist.
},
{
    420.2,421.28
     Yep, I guess so.
},
{
    421.28,422.12
     I don't know.
},
{
    422.12,424.28
     But anyways, so I started his treatment.
},
{
    424.28,427.24
     So basically what he's saying is tight back here.
},
{
    427.24,429.12
     It's almost a here down.
},
{
    429.12,431.08
     And if it's tight back here,
},
{
    431.08,433.76
     the movement of the rib cage has gotta come from somewhere.
},
{
    433.76,436.16
     So it gets hyper mobile here.
},
{
    436.16,437.82
     So by loosening this,
},
{
    437.82,440.8
     you don't put as much stress on the front, basically.
},
{
    440.8,443.0
     You know, he talks about the rib being like a handle
},
{
    443.0,443.84
     on a bucket.
},
{
    443.84,446.72
     They move up and down, up and down,
},
{
    446.72,448.44
     and there should be a hinge on each side
},
{
    448.44,452.16
     if the hinge gets a little rusty, you know, analogy.
},
{
    452.16,454.12
     On one side, you need to break it up
},
{
    454.12,456.48
     and get those ribs loose again.
},
{
    456.48,457.68
     So I'm a believer now.
},
{
    457.68,461.8
     I started out, he had, excuse me, Sam,
},
{
    461.8,463.8
     you're no longer needed.
},
{
    465.24,466.36
     Here's the whole treatment.
},
{
    466.36,467.56
     This is what you've been waiting for.
},
{
    467.56,470.12
     You've been putting up for this babble for seven minutes.
},
{
    470.12,471.52
     I think it's good to understand.
},
{
    471.52,472.84
     It is, Bob, it is.
},
{
    472.84,474.56
     And, you know, it's our show,
},
{
    474.56,476.88
     so we can take a little longer.
},
{
    476.88,478.2
     I thought I'll use one of these
},
{
    478.2,481.48
     because what Steve, he invented a device
},
{
    481.48,483.06
     called a Backpod Fort,
},
{
    483.06,484.68
     but it's like, I have to order it.
},
{
    484.68,485.52
     That's work. I gotta pay for it. They're kind of expensive. I thought, I'm gonna see if I invented a device called a back pod fort, but it's like, I have to order it. That's work.
},
{
    485.52,486.36
     I got to pay for it.
},
{
    486.36,487.18
     They're kind of expensive.
},
{
    487.18,489.4
     I thought, I'm gonna see if I can get something else to work.
},
{
    489.4,490.98
     And I kind of did.
},
{
    490.98,494.36
     I do use a six inch roller like this,
},
{
    494.36,497.7
     but it doesn't get specific enough to those back joints.
},
{
    497.7,501.2
     But you know, you can try this if you have one at home
},
{
    501.2,504.02
     and it will do some work.
},
{
    504.02,505.66
     And it's gonna be good for your posture anyway.
},
{
    505.66,507.4
     Right, it's not a bad thing for ya.
},
{
    507.4,510.2
     It's gonna help you one way or another.
},
{
    510.2,512.94
     Then to get more specific to those rib joints,
},
{
    512.94,516.12
     I try to softball and that helps.
},
{
    516.12,517.56
     That was a little more-
},
{
    517.56,519.08
     That's really aggressive though.
},
{
    519.08,519.92
     Yeah, it is.
},
{
    519.92,521.8
     You have to be careful.
},
{
    521.8,523.96
     I would say the average person's not gonna be able
},
{
    523.96,524.8
     to tolerate that.
},
{
    524.8,527.88
     Well, I'm supporting weight through my butt
},
{
    527.88,529.04
     and through my elbow.
},
{
    529.04,531.44
     And if I go all the way on it, it's very aggressive.
},
{
    531.44,534.68
     So, but you can still, if you don't wanna,
},
{
    534.68,535.92
     you know, get a back pod,
},
{
    535.92,538.54
     I think you can successfully treat with this,
},
{
    538.54,540.8
     but you're gonna have to work at it and get,
},
{
    540.8,542.96
     what should do, why don't you stand up, Bob?
},
{
    542.96,543.8
     I'm gonna show you.
},
{
    543.8,546.52
     He's gonna show the area where he's placing it.
},
{
    546.52,550.44
     Yeah, so we're working between the scapula
},
{
    550.44,552.64
     and the spine right there.
},
{
    552.64,554.6
     It's that muscle area.
},
{
    554.6,558.6
     And that's where those ribs connect to the vertebra.
},
{
    558.6,561.48
     And so I'm gonna start round your shoulders.
},
{
    561.48,562.32
     I know you don't, there we go.
},
{
    562.32,564.16
     It just makes it easier to show.
},
{
    564.16,567.36
     I'm gonna start here. I'm gonna work up and down here,
},
{
    567.36,568.52
     and then we're gonna go here.
},
{
    568.52,571.68
     And usually I do it three places, high, middle, low,
},
{
    571.68,575.66
     not necessarily in that order, but we get those three places.
},
{
    575.66,578.08
     And then I'm gonna show you what you do with your arms
},
{
    578.08,578.92
     and how you do it.
},
{
    578.92,581.48
     But I am gonna use the back pod because it really,
},
{
    581.48,584.72
     I mean, that's why it's made specifically this shape.
},
{
    584.72,585.56
     It works better. And again, it's really expensive, but if you look at, that's why it's made specifically this shape. It works better.
},
{
    585.56,587.3
     And again, it's really expensive,
},
{
    587.3,589.56
     but if you look at, there's two molds there.
},
{
    589.56,590.88
     Show the inside, Brad.
},
{
    590.88,592.84
     I mean, this thing, you could run a truck over it,
},
{
    592.84,594.18
     it's not gonna break down.
},
{
    594.18,597.82
     It's solid, it's built the way it's supposed to be built.
},
{
    597.82,600.48
     Bob says it expensive, but I spent,
},
{
    602.0,605.0
     you know, each emergency room visit was over $1,000.
},
{
    605.0,606.56
     You know, this is $80.
},
{
    606.56,607.4
     It's pretty cheap.
},
{
    607.4,608.76
     I wanna make sure everybody knows
},
{
    608.76,610.2
     we make nothing off this.
},
{
    610.2,612.8
     I just, I've become a big fan.
},
{
    612.8,614.64
     I use it for posture all the time.
},
{
    614.64,616.24
     Yeah, you can use it for other things.
},
{
    616.24,617.16
     Yeah, side joints.
},
{
    617.16,620.28
     I'm to the point now, like I bring it to my cabin.
},
{
    620.28,621.8
     Like if I miss a day,
},
{
    621.8,624.72
     I start feeling that pain between the shoulder blades
},
{
    624.72,626.12
     and this takes it away. So I mean a day, I start feeling that pain between the shoulder blades and this takes it away.
},
{
    626.12,629.36
     So I mean, it's one of the few things
},
{
    629.36,632.44
     that I would be low to give up in my life.
},
{
    632.44,635.76
     So here's how we both, Bob and I actually use it the same way.
},
{
    635.76,637.96
     I'm doing it for my costochondritis.
},
{
    637.96,641.56
     Bob likes it for his posture as well as his muscles
},
{
    641.56,643.72
     in his back, it's a good way to get him loose.
},
{
    643.72,645.64
     So I'm gonna put it here.
},
{
    645.64,647.84
     And this is my right side.
},
{
    647.84,649.84
     This is where I always develop the chest pain.
},
{
    649.84,651.92
     And I worked this side a little more
},
{
    651.92,654.32
     and I go on there like this.
},
{
    654.32,656.78
     And this is what Steve, the therapist who invented this,
},
{
    656.78,659.2
     you know, I did this on a video once.
},
{
    659.2,662.2
     And he emailed me the next day or a few days later.
},
{
    662.2,665.36
     He said, you forgot to do your arms up and down like this.
},
{
    665.36,666.88
     Right, yes, exactly.
},
{
    666.88,668.92
     And I start to do that.
},
{
    668.92,671.92
     Well, warning, if you're never used this before,
},
{
    671.92,674.24
     or if you're using the softball,
},
{
    674.24,679.44
     take a towel like this and unfold it,
},
{
    679.44,683.16
     whatever, layer it up and then put that over.
},
{
    683.16,685.04
     And also you may have a pillow under your head.
},
{
    685.04,687.24
     Yeah, and a pillow, exactly.
},
{
    687.24,690.72
     You may really have to blunt it first to start off with.
},
{
    690.72,693.84
     Cause especially if you're a thinner person,
},
{
    693.84,695.84
     it'll feel a little aggressive.
},
{
    695.84,697.52
     You know, I've been using it for quite a while
},
{
    697.52,700.36
     and I'd say after a couple of weeks of using this,
},
{
    700.36,702.16
     I welcome it without anything.
},
{
    702.16,704.0
     Right, but you did start with something, right?
},
{
    704.0,705.4
     Oh yeah, I used a towel.
},
{
    705.4,707.72
     I remember you telling me it was hard on you.
},
{
    707.72,709.28
     I just had a cavitation there.
},
{
    709.28,712.24
     It'll make your joints pop a little bit and crack.
},
{
    712.24,713.96
     This is the first thing I do in the morning.
},
{
    713.96,716.6
     I do it actually while I'm doing hamstring stretches.
},
{
    716.6,718.64
     You mean like right out of bed you get on the bed?
},
{
    718.64,720.08
     I get out of bed, I'm serious.
},
{
    720.08,721.2
     And I go to the bathroom.
},
{
    721.2,722.4
     Oh, wow, the first thing.
},
{
    722.4,727.4
     First thing, I get up, I go to the bathroom. First thing, I get up, I go to the bathroom,
},
{
    727.4,730.16
     I start stretching and I put this thing behind my back
},
{
    730.16,731.68
     and I hit the six spots.
},
{
    731.68,736.04
     And I used to have to like, right before I did a run,
},
{
    736.04,738.08
     I'd have to stretch my back out some more.
},
{
    738.08,740.24
     But this does it for me.
},
{
    740.24,743.68
     This is, and like I said, this has taken away
},
{
    743.68,745.92
     the pain between my shoulder blades. So, you know, the thing I like about this, this is, and like I said, this has taken away the pain between my shoulder blades.
},
{
    745.92,749.16
     So, you know, the thing I like about this, Brad too,
},
{
    749.16,751.6
     is that it comes with a booklet.
},
{
    751.6,753.96
     And that we did what, it was a 30 pages?
},
{
    753.96,754.8
     31.
},
{
    754.8,756.08
     31 pages.
},
{
    756.08,758.56
     And it's really well-written.
},
{
    758.56,760.46
     I mean, it goes over to the posture things.
},
{
    760.46,762.82
     It goes over a lot of things you can use this for.
},
{
    762.82,767.82
     The costochondritis, that book almost is worth $10 to me, Brad.
},
{
    768.6,769.78
     You know, it gives a good explanation.
},
{
    769.78,771.22
     Are you having fun?
},
{
    771.22,772.06
     I'm done.
},
{
    772.06,773.74
     I just wanted to show how fast it was.
},
{
    773.74,776.0
     I also treat my SI with it, it feels good.
},
{
    776.0,779.54
     And he has a pot of pasta on that.
},
{
    779.54,780.74
     What else do I speak to people?
},
{
    780.74,781.58
     A video on it?
},
{
    781.58,782.82
     Yeah, gotta, yeah.
},
{
    782.82,784.34
     Oh, he has a page in there.
},
{
    784.34,785.16
     Oh, he has a page in there. Oh, he has a page in there.
},
{
    785.16,786.0
     Describing on it.
},
{
    786.0,787.84
     I have not seen that for,
},
{
    787.84,789.4
     I think you mentioned it one time before
},
{
    789.4,790.72
     on one of our videos for a second.
},
{
    790.72,792.76
     Bob, our viewers are starting to get bored.
},
{
    792.76,794.24
     The main thing is done.
},
{
    794.24,796.36
     We show it how to use the back cut.
},
{
    796.36,797.48
     You got the alternatives.
},
{
    797.48,800.4
     You can try other things if you don't want to spend the money,
},
{
    800.4,803.0
     but remember Brad and I can fix just about anything.
},
{
    803.0,804.0
     Except for?
},
{
    804.0,804.92
     A broken heart.
},
{
    804.92,805.72
     There we go. We'll get that just about anything. Except for. A broken heart. There we go.
},
{
    805.72,807.82
     We'll get that fixed too someday.
},
{
    807.82,808.66
     Thanks for watching.
},
{
    808.66,810.32
     Boom, boom, boom, boom.
},
{
    810.32,None
     Boom, boom, boom. you
},
