     Hi there, I'm Anna Caban, Brand Ambassador for Balance Body.
},
{
    8.84,12.52
     Today I'm going to run you through five simple stretches that you can do to relieve your
},
{
    12.52,15.92
     neck and shoulder tension right now.
},
{
    15.92,17.52
     Let's get started.
},
{
    17.52,19.76
     So the first thing you want to do is either stand or sit.
},
{
    19.76,21.56
     It really doesn't matter.
},
{
    21.56,23.42
     And do a few shoulder strokes.
},
{
    23.42,27.68
     So we'll just lift up and then drop the shoulders down.
},
{
    27.68,30.72
     Again, you lift up, and drop down.
},
{
    30.72,32.36
     This is kind of like a warmup, right?
},
{
    32.36,35.24
     We're lifting and lowering.
},
{
    35.24,37.8
     And you could do five or 10 of these,
},
{
    37.8,39.8
     just to kind of get your shoulders going.
},
{
    41.96,43.52
     Let's do a couple more today.
},
{
    46.4,48.4
     One last time.
},
{
    48.4,50.56
     Great.
},
{
    50.56,54.44
     And then all I'll have you do is turn your head to one side and the other.
},
{
    54.44,58.4
     So I'm going to go to the left side first five times and then to the right side five
},
{
    58.4,59.4
     times.
},
{
    59.4,66.68
     So I turn to the left and hold it for five counts and come back to center. So give your
},
{
    66.68,72.0
     neck a chance to stretch out, right? So you're going to the side you're holding
},
{
    72.0,81.08
     and back to center. Same thing again, turn to the side, stretch and back to
},
{
    81.08,85.2
     center. Let's go for two more.
},
{
    87.32,97.48
     And one last time. Now over to the right, same thing. See how far you can turn your
},
{
    97.48,106.4
     head? Hold it and return. Now if you look to the back, you'll go a little further
},
{
    106.4,109.38
     because where your eyes go, the head follows.
},
{
    110.44,112.2
     And come to center.
},
{
    112.2,113.98
     Again, same thing to the side.
},
{
    117.14,119.12
     And bring it back.
},
{
    119.12,120.4
     Two more today.
},
{
    120.4,123.28
     And again, you could do five to 10 of these on each side.
},
{
    125.32,128.56
     And one last time to the side.
},
{
    130.28,131.12
     And back to center.
},
{
    131.12,133.16
     Now we're just bringing the chin down to the chest.
},
{
    133.16,134.76
     And I don't want you to force this.
},
{
    134.76,136.6
     Just think of a heavy head,
},
{
    136.6,138.0
     because if you have any discomfort,
},
{
    138.0,139.6
     you don't want to go too far.
},
{
    140.84,142.86
     Hold it for about five counts.
},
{
    143.9,145.44
     And then come on up.
},
{
    145.44,146.32
     Same thing again.
},
{
    146.32,147.24
     Now if it doesn't hurt,
},
{
    147.24,148.36
     let's see if you can really think
},
{
    148.36,151.08
     of sticking your chin on your chest.
},
{
    151.08,152.4
     Get that stretch.
},
{
    155.6,156.44
     And lift it up.
},
{
    157.64,159.16
     Let's go for three more.
},
{
    159.16,160.92
     Again, you could do five to 10.
},
{
    165.64,167.36
     And lift it up.
},
{
    167.36,169.2
     Last two.
},
{
    169.2,170.96
     Now with all these exercises,
},
{
    170.96,172.92
     whether you're sitting or standing,
},
{
    174.08,175.92
     let's remember to pull the abdominals in
},
{
    175.92,177.16
     and work on good posture.
},
{
    177.16,178.44
     That's gonna help you.
},
{
    178.44,179.64
     And you go down.
},
{
    183.8,185.6
     And come all the way up.
},
{
    185.6,187.92
     Now this one is my least favorite.
},
{
    187.92,189.2
     It's a little uncomfortable.
},
{
    189.2,191.56
     You take the ear to one shoulder.
},
{
    191.56,196.12
     So I'm taking the ear to the left shoulder and feeling a stretch on the right side.
},
{
    196.12,202.68
     You can intensify the stretch if you grab onto your head and give it a gentle pull.
},
{
    202.68,203.88
     And then bring it up again.
},
{
    203.88,205.64
     Think of holding about five counts.
},
{
    205.64,209.24
     Now if you're sitting, you could actually take your right hand and sit on it.
},
{
    209.24,213.2
     So as you're going to the side, you're both sitting on that hand and gently pulling with
},
{
    213.2,218.64
     the other hand, that will make the stretch even more intense.
},
{
    218.64,220.4
     And then come back to center.
},
{
    220.4,221.48
     Let's go for three more.
},
{
    221.48,225.08
     Same thing, you could do five to 10.
},
{
    227.48,229.36
     Now remember you wanna distinguish between pain and discomfort, lift it up.
},
{
    229.36,231.34
     So discomfort's okay if it feels like,
},
{
    231.34,233.5
     wow, I'm kinda feeling this,
},
{
    233.5,236.92
     almost like an achy pull, that's fine.
},
{
    236.92,238.84
     We just don't want sharp pain.
},
{
    238.84,241.92
     And then bring it up, let's go for one more to this side.
},
{
    241.92,245.0
     Over heavy ear to the shoulder
},
{
    247.94,249.44
     and switch over to your right side.
},
{
    249.44,252.36
     So again, you could start, see where you can go.
},
{
    252.36,254.72
     One side may be tighter.
},
{
    254.72,257.16
     You might be watching TV leaning one way.
},
{
    258.16,259.2
     Come on up.
},
{
    260.48,262.72
     When you go again, if you wanna add that hand gently,
},
{
    262.72,264.58
     just give a little pull here.
},
{
    267.4,269.4
     And bring it up.
},
{
    269.6,272.0
     Let's go for three more. Again, you could use the arm or not.
},
{
    272.0,278.4
     Remember, you could sit on your left hand if you want to add. So you're sitting on the left hand and you're adding that little pull.
},
{
    280.96,282.96
     And up.
},
{
    282.96,284.96
     Last two.
},
{
    282.0,284.0
     And up. Last two.
},
{
    284.0,288.0
     Again, you could go to 10, but today we'll just go to 5.
},
{
    288.0,291.0
     So you can kind of get a sense for this routine.
},
{
    291.0,294.0
     And one last time.
},
{
    294.0,299.0
     And come back up to center.
},
{
    299.0,301.0
     Now this one I'm going to call diagonal.
},
{
    301.0,306.02
     Because I'm going to get a stretch really right here by my scapula by taking my head
},
{
    306.02,311.18
     slightly to the side, let's say a quarter of the way or half the way to my shoulder,
},
{
    311.18,313.9
     and then lowering the chin down.
},
{
    313.9,316.42
     Now find that spot where you get the stretch back there.
},
{
    316.42,321.62
     It may be different than me, so kind of angle your chin one way or the other and see where
},
{
    321.62,324.38
     you get that nice gentle pull.
},
{
    324.38,328.52
     Hold it for about five seconds or five counts.
},
{
    328.52,330.48
     Coming up, center.
},
{
    330.48,334.48
     Same thing again, let's go for five repetitions today, knowing that you can go up to 10 if
},
{
    334.48,339.6
     you want.
},
{
    339.6,341.48
     And back to center.
},
{
    341.48,347.04
     Three more. Heavy chin, find the angle that works best for you
},
{
    347.04,348.4
     to get a stretch.
},
{
    350.24,351.08
     And up.
},
{
    352.72,355.8
     Last two, over heavy chin.
},
{
    360.32,362.04
     And up.
},
{
    362.04,363.1
     One more time.
},
{
    367.48,369.88
     Lift it up and then same thing to the other side.
},
{
    369.88,371.92
     Now my hope is you're starting to feel
},
{
    371.92,373.92
     your neck and shoulders loosen up.
},
{
    377.36,379.08
     And this is something you can do a few times
},
{
    379.08,381.56
     throughout the day or as needed.
},
{
    381.56,382.76
     This whole series.
},
{
    384.96,386.16
     And come on up.
},
{
    388.04,388.88
     Three more.
},
{
    395.32,396.16
     And lift.
},
{
    396.16,398.76
     Now you might notice one side is tighter than the other.
},
{
    398.76,402.48
     For me, not so much here, but definitely on the first side.
},
{
    405.02,406.62
     Now let's go for one more time.
},
{
    412.6,414.12
     And all the way up.
},
{
    414.12,416.3
     And there you have it, five simple stretches
},
{
    416.3,419.52
     to help you release tension in your neck and your shoulders.
},
{
    419.52,420.72
     I hope that helps.
},
{
    420.72,None
     Have a great day. Ciao!
},
