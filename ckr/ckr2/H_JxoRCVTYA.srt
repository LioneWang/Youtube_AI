     If you've got hunchback posture,
},
{
    44.56,46.88
     you might be feeling a little bit embarrassed and ashamed
},
{
    46.88,51.08
     and wondering, gosh, is there any way I can actually fix hunchback posture?
},
{
    51.08,55.92
     It just requires time, patience, and doing the right things for your body.
},
{
    55.92,59.56
     Your next question is probably, how long is this going to take?
},
{
    59.56,62.6
     I don't want to have hunchback posture my whole life.
},
{
    62.6,66.28
     And the 100% honest answer from what I've seen
},
{
    66.28,68.36
     with my own hunchback tendencies
},
{
    68.36,69.92
     and with clients that I've worked with
},
{
    69.92,72.44
     who have a lot of kyphosis in their upper backs
},
{
    72.44,77.44
     is that it really depends on the context of your hunchback.
},
{
    77.52,81.2
     And what that means is how much are you doing that's good?
},
{
    81.2,83.64
     How much are you doing that reverses that hunchback?
},
{
    83.64,90.2
     And how much are you doing on a regular basis that puts you into that hunchback posture? If you have
},
{
    90.2,96.36
     just a minor kyphosis, a minor bit of slouching and hunchbacking, then it could be really
},
{
    96.36,100.72
     quick. I've seen people really drastically improve their hunchback in a period of two
},
{
    100.72,109.76
     weeks. And I've seen other people take a really really really long time and some people get stuck because they kept doing the wrong things for so much
},
{
    109.76,114.04
     of their lives. How quickly you can improve your hunchback really depends on
},
{
    114.04,118.64
     your habits and on the exercises that you're doing on a regular basis. If one
},
{
    118.64,124.12
     of your habits is to do this all day long, which you might be doing right now
},
{
    124.12,125.28
     as you're watching this
},
{
    125.28,130.32
     video, then you're going to be encouraging your hunchback to stay a
},
{
    130.32,135.24
     kyphotic hunchback. It's really easy to get stuck in this position and just keep
},
{
    135.24,142.0
     on scrolling through looking at Instagram or Facebook or upright health's website.
},
{
    142.0,147.28
     Because all these things are so fascinating, the unfortunate side effect, however,
},
{
    147.28,150.26
     is that your spine gets really good
},
{
    150.26,152.36
     at being stuck in this position.
},
{
    152.36,154.06
     Or maybe you go to the gym all the time
},
{
    154.06,159.06
     to work on your abs and you like to do crunches all day
},
{
    159.28,163.32
     long at the gym
},
{
    163.32,169.92
     and you keep getting your body used to pulling the rib cage down and keeping
},
{
    169.92,172.88
     you stuck in this hunchback position.
},
{
    172.88,177.2
     This is not going to make it easy to improve your hunchback.
},
{
    177.2,181.96
     If on the other hand you start integrating different strategies to improve your posture
},
{
    181.96,189.12
     throughout the day, you'll start to see results and improvement in your hunchback posture quite quickly. So for
},
{
    189.12,192.44
     example, if you're using the phone and you want to try to work on your posture
},
{
    192.44,195.8
     while you're doing it, you might want to sit up against the wall with your chin
},
{
    195.8,200.16
     tucked, your head pulled back, and your knees here so that you can just maintain
},
{
    200.16,205.84
     this lined up posture without much effort. If you're looking for an exact
},
{
    205.84,209.44
     number of days, weeks, or months that it's going to take you specifically to
},
{
    209.44,213.68
     fix your hunchback posture, it's actually a number that nobody can give you.
},
{
    213.68,218.48
     It's a number that nobody can predict. It really depends on how you are using
},
{
    218.48,223.76
     your body and the habits and the exercises that you implement into your life.
},
{
    223.76,225.8
     What this means is that your hunchback
},
{
    225.8,229.16
     can get better or worse depending on what you're doing.
},
{
    229.16,231.84
     So if you want to keep your hunchback moving
},
{
    231.84,235.2
     in the better direction and improving and getting straighter,
},
{
    235.2,237.32
     you need to constantly work at it
},
{
    237.32,239.16
     and be paying attention to it
},
{
    239.16,242.0
     so that it becomes a more natural position for you.
},
{
    242.0,248.04
     And in the future, if you start to slack on it and you just go back to those old habits
},
{
    248.04,253.08
     of staring at the phone like this all the time, it's going to bring your hunchback
},
{
    253.08,254.44
     back.
