     What's up guys?
},
{
    1.8,5.04
     Hey, Jared Bechstrand here, doctor of physical therapy, tonantitan.com.
},
{
    5.04,8.72
     Coming at you today with eight of my favorite exercises to strengthen the muscles of your
},
{
    8.72,9.72
     neck.
},
{
    9.72,11.44
     The best part is they can all be done right at home.
},
{
    11.44,23.36
     So let's get into it right now.
},
{
    23.36,27.4
     Alright so as a physical therapist, neck pain is probably one of the most common conditions
},
{
    27.4,28.4
     that I treat.
},
{
    28.4,32.4
     In fact, I'd say between lower back pain and neck pain, that probably makes up about 50%
},
{
    32.4,34.04
     of my patient load.
},
{
    34.04,35.72
     It's a condition that affects a lot of us.
},
{
    35.72,39.16
     It affects us often, and when it does, it can be totally debilitating.
},
{
    39.16,43.6
     So today, I wanted to share with you some of my favorite exercises to hopefully strengthen
},
{
    43.6,47.32
     your neck and also alleviate some of that pain that you might be experiencing.
},
{
    47.32,50.48

    67.54,68.54
     So thank you so much for that in advance.
},
{
    68.54,69.54
     All right.
},
{
    69.54,70.54
     So let's get into it.
},
{
    70.54,74.82
     I would say that the majority of neck pain that I see in my clinic is actually due to
},
{
    74.82,76.06
     postural issues.
},
{
    76.06,78.26
     Now posture is a huge problem.
},
{
    78.26,79.26
     It's a huge issue.
},
{
    79.26,83.06
     I don't want to take too much time in this video to explain it to you and how to correct
},
{
    83.06,84.06
     it.
},
{
    84.06,86.18
     But what I'm going to do, I shot a video about it a couple of weeks ago.
},
{
    86.18,88.14
     I'm gonna leave a link down in the description.
},
{
    88.14,89.58
     You can also get it floating right around,
},
{
    89.58,90.86
     right up here right now.
},
{
    90.86,93.18
     That's gonna take you to some simple stretches
},
{
    93.18,95.72
     and exercises how to correct your posture.
},
{
    95.72,99.02
     Basically what it means is normal posture,
},
{
    99.02,101.7
     our head should be right over our shoulders,
},
{
    101.7,103.86
     our ears should be right over our shoulders.
},
{
    103.86,105.64
     Most of us don't spend time right there.
},
{
    105.64,107.48
     We're always on a phone or on a computer
},
{
    107.48,110.16
     or doing whatever down here in front of us.
},
{
    110.16,113.08
     When our shoulders round forward, our neck comes forward,
},
{
    113.08,115.52
     puts a lot of stress on our neck muscles
},
{
    115.52,117.16
     and that's what causes neck pain,
},
{
    117.16,119.0
     that's what causes neck stiffness.
},
{
    119.0,120.4
     And so a lot of these exercises
},
{
    120.4,122.4
     that I'm gonna show you today have to do
},
{
    122.4,124.72
     with basically getting out of this posture
},
{
    124.72,127.0
     and getting back up here where it needs to be.
},
{
    127.0,132.0
     It creates more space in the neck and alleviates a lot of the pain that you might be experiencing.
},
{
    132.0,134.0
     So that's the first point that I wanted to mention.
},
{
    134.0,141.0
     The second point is with neck pain oftentimes comes a lot of stiffness and just tension in your neck.
},
{
    141.0,147.4
     Again, the purposes of this video are to show you exercises to actually strengthen your neck and improve your posture. If you need to
},
{
    147.4,151.0
     stretch your way out of neck stiffness, again check the description down below.
},
{
    151.0,155.12
     I've got another video for stiff neck stretches. I'll also put the link right
},
{
    155.12,158.4
     up here, floating right up here right now. Check that out if you've got a stiff neck.
},
{
    158.4,161.88
     One more video that you might find helpful. Sorry, I know I'm coming at you
},
{
    161.88,170.24
     with a lot. Muscle knots in your neck and shoulders. It's a super common condition with neck pain. I shot another video about that one. If you experience
},
{
    170.24,174.32
     knots in your neck and upper shoulders, again, description down below will help you out. Check
},
{
    174.32,180.0
     that link or check the description for the link to that video. Also floating around right up here.
},
{
    180.0,183.68
     Okay, those are all the videos that I'll share with you guys. Let's get into some of these neck
},
{
    183.68,188.24
     exercises. Again, the primary emphasis with these is going to be strengthening the muscles in your
},
{
    188.24,192.6
     neck, strengthening the muscles in your shoulders and kind of upper back to get you into the
},
{
    192.6,196.64
     right posture that you need to be in to be pain-free and more functional.
},
{
    196.64,199.12
     Let's start showing them to you right now.
},
{
    199.12,203.54
     So when I talk about neck rehab and neck strengthening exercises, I'm always concerned
},
{
    203.54,205.2
     with basically five major motions
},
{
    205.2,210.88
     or five major muscle groups. Flexion and extension, side bend left, side bend right, and then the
},
{
    210.88,215.28
     postural muscles. And so these exercises again that I'm going to show you are geared towards
},
{
    215.28,219.44
     strengthening all of those areas. Primarily if you can keep one thing in mind while I'm
},
{
    219.44,224.32
     demonstrating these, we want to get you out of this type of a posture. You'll see how my upper
},
{
    224.32,227.4
     backgrounds forward and then my neck right here has to really
},
{
    227.4,230.76
     extend so we call that upper cervical extension.
},
{
    230.76,233.32
     So I'm down here but I'm looking up like this.
},
{
    233.32,235.32
     That puts a ton of stress in that area.
},
{
    235.32,239.2
     So we want to get out of that and then we want to get the chin and the head back in
},
{
    239.2,241.0
     the right in the normal position.
},
{
    241.0,244.48
     And so these exercises that I'm going to show you are geared towards those things.
},
{
    244.48,248.52
     Okay, now we're going to jump into them. Alright so exercise number
},
{
    248.52,252.24
     one that we're going to do are called chin tucks. Basically what I want you to
},
{
    252.24,255.88
     do is lie down flat on your back with your head flat. There's no pillow
},
{
    255.88,259.52
     underneath my head right now. And then what I want you to do is try to tuck
},
{
    259.52,263.4
     your chin down into your throat. Basically the motion we're trying to
},
{
    263.4,266.36
     promote here is called upper cervical rotation.
},
{
    266.36,268.52
     And so it looks just like that.
},
{
    268.52,272.56
     Hold for three, two, three, and then come right back up.
},
{
    272.56,275.74
     Chin tucked down and hold one, two, three,
},
{
    275.74,277.8
     and then come right back up.
},
{
    277.8,281.32
     The goal here is to activate those deep neck flexors
},
{
    281.32,283.2
     is gonna help to pull that head
},
{
    283.2,284.84
     back to where it needs to be.
},
{
    284.84,288.16
     And so these ones, again, you should feel a stretch, you should feel a pull
},
{
    288.16,291.96
     through kind of the base of your skull, but then you'll feel the active muscles
},
{
    291.96,295.72
     are kind of deep in your neck. Again, those are the deep cervical flexors.
},
{
    295.72,299.96
     That's exercise number one. That's really going to help to basically just open up
},
{
    299.96,303.08
     your vertebrae. I give this one to people who have headaches all the time.
},
{
    303.08,306.18
     Also those who might be experiencing stenosis type problems,
},
{
    306.18,308.62
     numbness, tingling down and through your arms, shoulders, hands,
},
{
    309.0,311.4
     those are going to be good. That's a good exercise for that.
},
{
    312.12,315.82
     Exercise number two is going to be more of a cervical flexion.
},
{
    316.0,320.06
     So now what I'm going to do is you're going to lay on like a bed at home where
},
{
    320.06,324.2
     your head can actually fall off the edge of the bed.
},
{
    324.48,328.08
     Now I don't want you to let it fall down.
},
{
    328.08,330.8
     You'll see how I'm extending through my neck right now.
},
{
    330.8,332.9
     That's not the motion that I'm after here.
},
{
    332.9,335.52
     I want you to try to keep your neck kind of more
},
{
    335.52,338.96
     your face flat towards the ceiling as you come down.
},
{
    338.96,341.36
     But then what we're gonna do is keep that face flat
},
{
    341.36,344.96
     to the ceiling and lift it straight up towards the ceiling.
},
{
    344.96,345.36
     And then right back down and then straight up towards the ceiling and then right
},
{
    345.36,351.2
     back down and then straight up towards the ceiling just like that. What we're doing here, just a
},
{
    351.2,356.72
     little bit more stress, it's a little more activation of those deep neck flexor muscles. We're coming
},
{
    356.72,362.96
     up into this flexion position. It's a great strengthening exercise if you can tolerate it.
},
{
    362.96,365.0
     Again, it's a little more aggressive than number one, but it's a great exercise if you can tolerate it again It's a little more aggressive than number one
},
{
    365.0,369.44
     But it's a great exercise if you come right down here and right up here again
},
{
    369.44,373.44
     I'm not extending back this way, and I'm not flexing way down this way
},
{
    373.44,377.4
     I'm trying to keep that net that face flat to the ceiling as I'm going up and down
},
{
    377.48,380.24
     So that's those are the two that I like for your neck flexors
},
{
    380.8,384.4
     Side bending muscles and so if you just roll right over onto your side
},
{
    385.72,389.72
     side bending muscles and so if you just roll right over onto your side you're going to take your neck down kind of as far as you can this way and then we're
},
{
    389.72,393.08
     going to raise it up as far as we can this way and we're going to shoot for I
},
{
    393.08,396.36
     didn't mention on the last one three sets of ten is a good number to shoot for
},
{
    396.36,400.68
     on this one as well I would do this ten right now I'm going on my right and then
},
{
    400.68,404.36
     I would roll over and then I would do ten more on the left as well so you're
},
{
    404.36,407.44
     coming down and up and it looks just like that
},
{
    407.44,409.6
     You're gonna feel that one in the side of your neck
},
{
    410.16,414.16
     If anything pinches or if anything is painful with these please stop them immediately
},
{
    414.46,420.44
     You might go kind of back to those stretching the stretching video that I explained kind of in the intro to this video
},
{
    420.6,422.76
     Also the description down below again
},
{
    422.76,428.32
     These these exercises are geared towards strengthening those muscles, not necessarily stretching them
},
{
    428.32,432.08
     out. Okay, and so then to finish it off, what I like to do is roll over onto your
},
{
    432.08,436.24
     stomach and then number four. So again, we did a flexion forward, side bend right,
},
{
    436.24,440.52
     side bend left. Now let's work into some extension. The way we're going to do that
},
{
    440.52,445.28
     is let your let your face, let your chin and everything kind of fall off the edge of
},
{
    445.28,453.48
     the table. But now the motion that we're after here, I don't want you to look up this way.
},
{
    453.48,457.2
     You'll see that that just kind of promotes that bad posture that I was telling you about.
},
{
    457.2,462.64
     I don't want a ton of extension through your upper neck. What I'd rather have is kind of
},
{
    462.64,469.72
     again keeping your head flat, but you're going gonna lift anti-gravity up towards the ceiling. So what that looks like, so I'm down here and
},
{
    469.72,474.34
     then what I'm going to do is just engage those neck muscles to lift. What I tell
},
{
    474.34,478.48
     people is lift the back of your head up towards the ceiling and then come back
},
{
    478.48,487.16
     down. And so it looks just like this. So we're up here and then come back down. Up, whole two, three, and then come back down.
},
{
    487.16,488.08
     So it looks like that.
},
{
    488.08,492.2
     So it's more of a lower neck flexion
},
{
    492.2,494.56
     with like an upper cervical extension
},
{
    494.56,498.04
     instead of extending all the way through the neck.
},
{
    498.04,500.6
     Basically what that does, this position,
},
{
    500.6,503.64
     is gonna again kind of cause that stenosis problem,
},
{
    503.64,505.04
     put a ton of stress on your neck
},
{
    505.4,507.68
     Basically, you don't need to go through that motion
},
{
    507.68,511.82
     We want to work kind of the lower the postural muscles while keeping those upper cervical
},
{
    512.52,518.84
     Muscles nice and relaxed and and nice and neutral so from here pull up to here and then back down
},
{
    518.88,522.62
     So again about three sets of ten on that one is what you're going to shoot for
},
{
    523.64,527.44
     I'm going to get rid of this table And I want to show you the next exercises that I have
},
{
    527.44,531.28
     for you are geared towards improving your posture, helping out some of the muscles that
},
{
    531.28,532.28
     support your neck.
},
{
    532.28,534.44
     So we'll jump into those.
},
{
    534.44,538.8
     Now these next three exercises are all about postural strengthening and control.
},
{
    538.8,544.16
     Again, the goal here is that we want to give your neck a nice firm foundation, a nice stable
},
{
    544.16,545.96
     kind of supportive structure
},
{
    545.96,548.28
     in order to move and operate on top of.
},
{
    548.28,550.4
     Also to kind of pull the shoulders back together
},
{
    550.4,552.68
     and get your posture back where we need it to be.
},
{
    552.68,554.96
     Now I'm gonna do these on a stability ball
},
{
    554.96,557.44
     or an exercise ball if you've got one at home, great.
},
{
    557.44,559.76
     If you don't have one, I'll leave a link to actually
},
{
    559.76,561.4
     this one down in the description below
},
{
    561.4,562.8
     so you can check that out.
},
{
    562.8,565.18
     Or you can do these also,
},
{
    565.18,568.14
     I have patients who do them on the edge of their bed.
},
{
    568.14,569.98
     Some people even do them on the kitchen table
},
{
    569.98,570.94
     or on the counter.
},
{
    570.94,573.14
     Whatever works for you, get creative with it.
},
{
    573.14,575.38
     Now, if I were to sit here in front of you,
},
{
    575.38,578.7
     these exercises I call them Y, T, and I's.
},
{
    578.7,582.46
     And so that's a Y right there, that's a T right there.
},
{
    582.46,583.86
     And I don't know why they call it an I,
},
{
    583.86,587.4
     but I guess if I were to come down here, sometimes I'll call it an A. I think that looks more like
},
{
    587.4,589.8
     an A. I don't know, it's up to you to decide.
},
{
    589.8,591.2
     And so let's get over the ball.
},
{
    591.2,594.48
     And so my torso is supported on the ball.
},
{
    594.48,595.88
     My feet are nice and wide.
},
{
    595.88,598.4
     My feet are also touching the wall back behind me.
},
{
    598.4,600.6
     That adds a little bit more stability to the system.
},
{
    600.6,604.64
     And then what you're going to do is come right up here into the Y. And so I'm pulling my
},
{
    604.64,607.92
     hands up, and I'm trying to squeeze my shoulder blades together at
},
{
    607.92,610.88
     the top of that Y and then come back down.
},
{
    610.88,613.04
     T is going to be straight out to this side.
},
{
    613.04,616.84
     And again, I want to come up as high as I can, squeeze my shoulder blades together, and
},
{
    616.84,617.84
     then right back down.
},
{
    617.84,623.48
     And then the I or the A is going to be back behind you in that position right there.
},
{
    623.48,626.6
     Now, if we're talking about strengthening our neck,
},
{
    626.6,629.76
     I use these a lot for shoulder and rotator cuff patients
},
{
    629.76,630.6
     as well.
},
{
    630.6,632.2
     If we're talking specifically about the neck,
},
{
    632.2,634.4
     I want you to pay attention to your neck posture
},
{
    634.4,635.64
     while you're doing these.
},
{
    635.64,637.24
     I'm talking to you, I'm talking to the camera,
},
{
    637.24,639.8
     so I've got a lot of extension going on through my neck.
},
{
    639.8,641.04
     If you're doing these at home,
},
{
    641.04,642.32
     I want you to try to keep your neck
},
{
    642.32,643.96
     in a more neutral position.
},
{
    643.96,648.96
     So if I were doing these for my neck at home, it would be my face is down right here.
},
{
    648.96,654.72
     I'm coming up into the Y and then I'm keeping my gaze directed down towards the floor, not
},
{
    654.72,655.72
     up this way.
},
{
    655.72,658.84
     Again, I don't want to promote that upper cervical extension.
},
{
    658.84,660.28
     Put more stress on my neck.
},
{
    660.28,661.88
     I want to hit the postural muscles.
},
{
    661.88,666.2
     So you're after the muscles that are between your shoulder blades is where you should fill this one
},
{
    666.2,669.32
     So right here we're going to come up into the Y. That's one
},
{
    670.24,676.0
     Into the T. That's two really trying to squeeze the shoulder blades together in the back a that's three
},
{
    676.0,681.38
     I would do a set of ten of those and then I would repeat that three times. I've got one more to show you
},
{
    682.32,686.68
     Your last exercise for better posture and improved strength in your neck muscles, I
},
{
    686.68,689.32
     call it a wall angel or a wall slide.
},
{
    689.32,691.64
     What you're going to do is back up against the wall.
},
{
    691.64,695.92
     I want your hips, your shoulder blades, and the back of your head up against the wall.
},
{
    695.92,700.92
     Again, we're trying to promote this nice neutral kind of good posture with the shoulder blades
},
{
    700.92,702.4
     back and the head back.
},
{
    702.4,704.04
     Those three cues are going to help you to get there.
},
{
    704.04,706.52
     So hips, shoulder blades, back of the wall,
},
{
    706.52,707.64
     or up against the wall.
},
{
    707.64,709.4
     And then what I want you to do is if you can,
},
{
    709.4,711.0
     get your knuckles to the wall.
},
{
    711.0,713.76
     If you've got kind of that rounded shoulders,
},
{
    713.76,716.44
     forward head posture, that might be a real struggle
},
{
    716.44,717.96
     to get into that position,
},
{
    717.96,719.6
     but that's the goal that we're going for.
},
{
    719.6,721.64
     Hips, shoulder blades, back of the head,
},
{
    721.64,723.64
     and then knuckles are against the wall.
},
{
    723.64,724.96
     In this position, what I want you to do
},
{
    724.96,727.04
     is keep your knuckles in contact with the wall
},
{
    727.04,731.68
     while you slide up and over your head and then right back down to the starting
},
{
    731.68,737.04
     position. That's one up over my head and back down and that's two. And what you're
},
{
    737.04,741.04
     going to feel here is those muscles between your shoulder blades going crazy.
},
{
    741.04,744.2
     That's where I want you to feel this. You'll probably feel it a little bit in
},
{
    744.2,748.2
     your shoulders. We're using a little bit of the delts to give the arms up and over
},
{
    748.2,752.08
     your head. But the muscles that we're after are the ones that are pulling your shoulder
},
{
    752.08,757.72
     blades together in this position while you're going up and over your head. So it's those
},
{
    757.72,761.96
     muscles between your shoulder blades that we're really trying to focus on here. And again,
},
{
    761.96,769.6
     do a set of 10, take a break, and then repeat that two more times, three sets of 10 on the wall angels, and those are all the exercises that I have
},
{
    769.6,773.8
     for you guys today. So again, we looked at the deep neck flexors. We looked at the flexion
},
{
    773.8,778.08
     extension and side bend muscles in your neck. And then I showed you about four, the wise
},
{
    778.08,783.16
     T's, eyes, and then these wall slides for just the posture to get, again, we're trying
},
{
    783.16,786.12
     to build a firm foundation for the neck
},
{
    786.12,787.32
     to move on top of.
},
{
    787.32,790.74
     That's our goal with those postural correction exercises.
},
{
    790.74,792.6
     So hey, I hope you guys found this helpful.
},
{
    792.6,793.92
     I hope that it does help you out.
},
{
    793.92,796.3
     What I found in my experience as a physical therapist
},
{
    796.3,798.66
     is to do these strengthening exercises
},
{
    798.66,801.6
     in conjunction with some good neck stretches.
},
{
    801.6,804.0
     Check the description down below for that link.
},
{
    804.0,807.92
     It's a really good combination to really help alleviate some of the tension and stress
},
{
    807.92,811.2
     that you're having in your neck can be a super effective home treatment for it.
},
{
    811.2,814.08
     And so anyway, I hope you guys appreciated this. I hope that you found
