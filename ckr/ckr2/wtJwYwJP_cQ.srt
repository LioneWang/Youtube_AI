     Now let's cover one rescuer, Child CPR for the healthcare provider.
},
{
    8.04,12.3
     Our scene is safe, our gloves are on, and our rescue mask with the one-way valve is
},
{
    12.3,13.3
     available.
},
{
    13.3,14.96
     I'm going to call out to the child.
},
{
    14.96,15.96
     Are you alright?
},
{
    15.96,16.96
     Can you hear me?
},
{
    16.96,18.16
     They don't respond.
},
{
    18.16,22.04
     I now place one hand on their forehead as I tap on their collarbone.
},
{
    22.04,23.04
     Are you okay?
},
{
    23.04,24.04
     Can you hear me?
},
{
    24.04,25.92
     The child still does not respond.
},
{
    25.92,31.36
     It's at this time that I activate EMS, call 911 or call a code. If I have a bystander,
},
{
    31.36,37.52
     I'll send them to call 911 and then have them come back with an AED if they have one available.
},
{
    37.52,47.2
     After this, I need to assess this child for normal breathing and check their carotid pulse. I check it for no more than 10 seconds.
},
{
    47.2,50.88
     The child is not breathing and they do not have a pulse.
},
{
    50.88,54.0
     At this time, I'm gonna go right into CPR.
},
{
    54.0,57.08
     Located between their breasts on the sternum,
},
{
    57.08,59.92
     I'm now gonna start my 30 compressions,
},
{
    59.92,63.32
     compressing the chest one third of the depth of their chest
},
{
    63.32,65.22
     that are of rate between 100 and
},
{
    65.22,67.92
     120 times per minute.
},
{
    67.92,73.16
     One and two and three and four and five and six and seven and eight, nine and ten, eleven
},
{
    73.16,78.84
     and twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, thirty-two,
},
{
    78.84,82.84
     twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty.
},
{
    82.84,87.58
     I'm going to grab my rescue mask, head tilt, chin lift if it's not already there, and I'm
},
{
    87.58,91.66
     going to give two rescue breaths.
},
{
    91.66,95.28
     First one goes in.
},
{
    95.28,98.7
     Second one goes in, back onto the 30 compressions.
},
{
    98.7,107.0
     And I'm going to continue this 30 compressions to two rescue breaths until the patient revives, until the AED arrives, or
},
{
    108.44,111.32
     until EMS or help comes in and can take over.
},
