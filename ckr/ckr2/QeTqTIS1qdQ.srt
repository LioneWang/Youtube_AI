{
    35.16,38.68
     Otherwise, let's talk about how to use eye ointment.
},
{
    38.68,40.56
     So there are different types of eye ointments, right?
},
{
    40.56,42.2
     There's ones with antibiotics in them,
},
{
    42.2,44.72
     usually used for like corneal abrasions or infections,
},
{
    44.72,48.56
     or there's ones that are just lubrication ointments, kind of like this retained nighttime
},
{
    48.56,50.48
     PM that I have here.
},
{
    50.48,55.44
     But really, they're very thick, and that's why they're great is that they really provide
},
{
    55.44,61.04
     some excellent protection for the eye if they're either extremely dry, irritated, or maybe
},
{
    61.04,66.32
     your eyes don't close all the way while sleeping, and so some type of a nighttime PM ointment like this one here will give you really the maximal protection to prevent your eyes don't close all the way while sleeping and so some type of a nighttime PM ointment like this one here
},
{
    66.32,70.28
     Will give you the really the maximal protection to prevent your eyes from drying out
},
{
    70.4,76.94
     But because these ointments are so thick so much more thick than just the regular lubricating eye drops
},
{
    76.94,80.64
     They can be a bit messy and a little bit more difficult to get into the eye
},
{
    80.64,88.44
     So I wanted to have this guide so that you can get the most benefits of getting these in the eye. Okay, so now actually to apply the eye ointment, there's
},
{
    88.44,92.72
     really two different methods. One is just actually using the applicator tip to get
},
{
    92.72,96.68
     it directly in the eye. And the other method is actually putting the actual ointment on
},
{
    96.68,100.72
     your finger and getting that onto the eyelid. Now there's a couple of benefits, pros and
},
{
    100.72,105.0
     cons of each method. Using the applicator tip can sometimes be more direct.
},
{
    105.0,107.0
     You can get it in the eye without actually touching your eyelid.
},
{
    107.0,111.0
     However, there's a little bit of the risk that if you're not super coordinated,
},
{
    111.0,114.0
     you could actually end up poking your eye with the applicator tip,
},
{
    114.0,118.0
     or you could get, like, if you have some sort of, let's say, infection,
},
{
    118.0,122.0
     the bacteria could get on the applicator and then you contaminate the ointment.
},
{
    122.0,124.0
     So, yeah, that's no good.
},
{
    124.0,125.6
     The other method is putting it on your finger.
},
{
    125.6,129.76
     And this is the method I find most convenient, and we'll go over exactly some demonstrations
},
{
    129.76,131.12
     of how to do that.
},
{
    131.12,135.72
     But you do have to make sure that your hands and that your eyelids are perfectly clean,
},
{
    135.72,139.2
     because again, you're going to be touching your eyelid and you don't want to give yourself
},
{
    139.2,140.28
     an eye infection.
},
{
    140.28,143.68
     So with either method, you want to start off by washing your hands and washing your face.
},
{
    143.68,148.8
     Make sure that nothing's on there. Second part is inspecting the actual applicator tip and
},
{
    148.8,154.0
     making sure that one it's not expired and two that it's not dirty. If somebody is a laborer or
},
{
    154.0,158.48
     they work in a dusty, dirty environment then you know a lot of times that dust gets in the eye,
},
{
    158.48,162.72
     gets irritated and you want to put something in but you want to make sure that it's not covered in
},
{
    162.72,169.2
     grease or anything because you could potentially get that on your finger or on your eye and again cause some major problems.
},
{
    169.2,172.88
     Then it's just a matter of removing the lid. Now this first method we're going to go ahead and get
},
{
    172.88,178.8
     the applicator tip to the eye. The best part is just using your non-dominant hand to hold the eye
},
{
    178.8,183.36
     lid, the lower eyelid down, use your dominant hand to hold the applicator and then basically,
},
{
    183.92,189.12
     you know, you look in front of a a mirror which I prefer because it helps me guide that where the applicator is actually touching
},
{
    189.12,193.6
     the eye or if you have a friend or family member to help you out that works too. But you hold down
},
{
    193.6,198.56
     the lower eyelid and then you squirt about one fourth ribbon onto the lower eyelid.
},
{
    200.8,205.4
     As you can see it's very very thick and sometimes it is difficult for the ointment to let go
},
{
    205.4,207.2
     of itself to get onto the eye.
},
{
    207.2,209.24
     So that actually worked pretty well.
},
{
    209.24,213.16
     Getting it into the eye through that applicator method is pretty difficult and as you can
},
{
    213.16,217.76
     see it's very goopy thick stuff so it'll blur your vision a little bit.
},
{
    217.76,221.28
     Then once you've done it you can just recap the applicator and then make sure you put
},
{
    221.28,223.08
     it someplace where you remember where to find it.
},
{
    223.08,225.06
     The next step is if you want to try it with a just using your finger. Again, make sure your hands and your eyelids are it someplace where you remember where to find it. The next step is if you wanna try it
},
{
    225.06,226.76
     with just using your finger.
},
{
    226.76,228.48
     Again, make sure your hands and your eyelids
},
{
    228.48,229.52
     are perfectly clean,
},
{
    229.52,231.16
     cause you're gonna be touching your face.
},
{
    231.16,233.04
     Now, again, it's kind of the same thing.
},
{
    233.04,237.12
     You put about a 1 fourth inch ribbon on your finger,
},
{
    237.12,239.08
     and then with that 1 fourth inch ribbon,
},
{
    239.08,240.4
     you pull down that lower eyelid
},
{
    240.4,241.76
     using probably your middle finger,
},
{
    241.76,242.96
     makes it a little bit easier,
},
{
    242.96,252.4
     and then go ahead and get that on that lower eyelid and there we go. It's in. But yeah, this stuff is very very thick and goopy
},
{
    253.2,256.48
     and because it's so goopy again it'll blur your vision so it's going to be tougher to see.
},
{
    257.12,262.32
     But it feels good. I don't really feel any sort of irritation or dryness to the eye. Again it's
},
{
    262.32,267.76
     excellent if you have either an abrasion maybe you just need some lubrication for dryness to the eye. Again, it's excellent if you have either an abrasion, maybe you just need some lubrication for dryness,
},
{
    267.76,269.96
     or maybe you sleep with your eyes open,
},
{
    269.96,273.06
     and this will give you that extra layer of coating protection
},
{
    273.06,275.04
     so that your eyes don't dry out at night.
},
{
    275.04,277.2
     Now, again, because this stuff is so thick,
},
{
    277.2,279.8
     that means that when you wake up in the morning,
},
{
    279.8,282.56
     this again, this is a nighttime PM ointment from Oncisoft,
},
{
    282.56,284.74
     but you go ahead and put that in the eye,
},
{
    284.74,287.08
     the next morning the eye's gonna be really blurry, and you may still have a lot of this ointment from Occysoft, but you go ahead and put that in the eye. The next morning the eye's gonna be really blurry
},
{
    287.08,289.76
     and you may still have a lot of this ointment on the eye,
},
{
    289.76,293.0
     so you may still have to clean the eyelids really, really
},
{
    293.0,296.06
     well to make sure that it's not just all stuck in there.
},
{
    296.06,297.64
     So as you can see, applying eye ointment
},
{
    297.64,299.36
     can be a little bit difficult,
},
{
    299.36,301.72
     so hopefully it works out well for you.
},
{
    301.72,304.16
     Otherwise, if you often have trouble getting eye drops in,
},
{
    304.16,306.06
     I have a whole other video on how to put eye drops in
},
{
    306.06,309.22
     and a whole series about the best eye drops to use.
},
{
    309.22,310.66
     So if you'd like to check that out,
},
{
    310.66,312.42
     I'll go ahead and hook that up here in the playlist
},
{
    312.42,315.22
     up above as well as in the YouTube description below.
},
{
    315.22,316.86
     Otherwise, I have some other pro tips
},
{
    316.86,319.22
     about using eye ointment, so let's go over those.
},
{
    319.22,322.14
     So tip number one is that this stuff is so thick.
},
{
    322.14,324.02
     If you're using other types of eye drops,
},
{
    324.02,326.08
     make sure you use the other eyedrops,
},
{
    326.08,328.92
     such as your medications and things like that, first.
},
{
    328.92,330.32
     Because this stuff is so thick
},
{
    330.32,332.48
     that it'll prevent those drops
},
{
    332.48,334.96
     from actually settling in and absorbing into the eye
},
{
    334.96,335.8
     and helping you.
},
{
    335.8,338.6
     So yes, always put the ointment in last.
},
{
    338.6,341.28
     Tip number two is don't use ointment with contact lenses
},
{
    341.28,344.28
     unless recommended to you by your doctor
},
{
    344.28,349.2
     for something like a corneal abrasion or a bandage contact lens. Otherwise, it's just going to ruin your contact
},
{
    349.2,353.36
     lenses. Tip number three is that if you do touch the applicator tip, something to like your eyelid
},
{
    353.36,357.36
     or your finger and you want to make sure it's not contaminated, go ahead and get some like rubbing
},
{
    357.36,362.96
     alcohol like 99% and go ahead and just clean the tip of the applicator. Make sure that it is nice
},
{
    362.96,365.44
     and clean. So tip number four is that most of the time
},
{
    365.44,367.04
     you can find these at your pharmacy,
},
{
    367.04,369.16
     but sometimes they are a little bit difficult.
},
{
    369.16,371.36
     And keep in mind that you can of course shop online,
},
{
    371.36,372.96
     these are available over the counter,
},
{
    372.96,374.64
     and I have some extra links to those
},
{
    374.64,376.8
     in the description below if you wanna check those out.
},
{
    376.8,378.88
     Tip number five is that if you visit your eye doctor
},
{
    378.88,381.48
     at the eye clinic, most clinics do actually have
},
{
    381.48,383.52
     some type of manufacturer coupon
},
{
    383.52,384.96
     to save you a couple extra bucks.
},
{
    384.96,387.38
     So make sure to use that as a resource.
