     Bob and Brad the two most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    8.32,11.68
     Hi, I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist Brad Heineck physical therapist together
},
{
    11.68,16.4
     We are the most famous physical therapists on the internet in our opinion of course Bob Brad you're taking the reins today
},
{
    16.44,20.76
     Well, yeah, we want to go over three top three medically proven
},
{
    21.36,23.92
     exercises to help a herniated disc and
},
{
    26.16,29.76
     proven exercises to help a herniated disc and or pinched nerve because sometimes that that nerve can be pinched, that pain going on down the leg can be
},
{
    29.76,35.72
     from that disc or it can be from the piriformis muscles. So these are going
},
{
    35.72,39.04
     to cover all three of them so you're going to try all three of them and you're
},
{
    39.04,42.56
     going to do the one that gives the best results. That sounds good because I think
},
{
    42.56,47.92
     a lot of times people do have a pure pharmacist's a muscle in your butt basically and it goes over the nerve
},
{
    47.92,52.6
     and sometimes people think it's coming from their herniated disc, they might
},
{
    52.6,56.76
     even have a herniated disc but it's actually coming from the butt. Alright let's get to the exercises Bob.
},
{
    56.76,61.4
     Bob can you hold this? Sure. You want me to do the exercise? No, I've already had it in my mind.
},
{
    61.4,65.0
     I pictured myself doing my one- want to do the figure four first
},
{
    65.0,68.8
     Which is pretty simple. You just take your right ankle put it on your left knee
},
{
    69.16,73.0
     It's gonna look like this from this angle and you can do this on bed
},
{
    73.0,74.68
     You're making the four here, right?
},
{
    74.68,81.36
     Yep, and if you want to stretch your hip a little bit here you can but the primary part of the stretch is you're gonna bring this knee up
},
{
    82.12,84.92
     Okay, and you feel that stretch right down in there
},
{
    85.3,90.74
     Okay, now the nice thing about this exercise you can do it in two different ways. I would start here
},
{
    91.34,96.6
     See what the results are and you're gonna feel these results pretty quick. It should feel good while you're doing it
},
{
    96.6,101.64
     Yeah, if it makes it worse or it spreads the pain out, it's done. It's done. Check it off
},
{
    101.64,107.76
     It's not for you. You can also do it in a seated position Make sure you have good posture here and you push here
},
{
    108.06,113.34
     This is gonna vary, I would start there you can try it this way and see how it results
},
{
    113.58,114.94
     Okay
},
{
    114.94,121.66
     Again, you should feel the symptom relief while you're doing it and very quickly and it should feel good after you're done
},
{
    121.66,125.76
     You get up you walk around you should have positive results feeling better if not
},
{
    126.48,131.36
     Check it off. Just has a verification here Brad. So if the pain is going down the right leg
},
{
    131.36,134.84
     That's the one you cross over right so you want to lay down real quick sure
},
{
    135.08,141.0
     So if it's right leg you're gonna go like that right if it's left leg you're gonna go like that good point
},
{
    141.0,142.56
     Then you pull up
},
{
    142.56,148.44
     Then you're pulling up like that. Yep. Okay., excellent point Bob. This is why he's alone because
},
{
    148.84,152.5
     otherwise he's missing while I come in. Major points like this. The next one is just
},
{
    153.2,155.2
     on your stomach.
},
{
    156.3,159.9
     Now you can't do this one on the bed, you really should do it on a carpeted floor.
},
{
    160.22,168.12
     So it's comfortable. Hands here and a simple press up like this. Now what he's doing here is he's keeping his pelvis down
},
{
    168.8,174.08
     He's not lifting this up like a board, right? He's trying to make an arch in the back here
},
{
    174.08,180.6
     That's really key and again if it starts to hurt when you go way up just go into the pain-free zone
},
{
    180.6,182.6
     Stay down in the lower end here
},
{
    183.56,185.72
     Now on this one if you happen if
},
{
    185.72,190.04
     you're having pain down your leg by the first one it might be uncomfortable, you
},
{
    190.04,193.32
     do a few more and if it starts to improve with each repetition you keep
},
{
    193.32,198.92
     going, ten is ooze you the max, you do it one time, you can maybe go up to 15 if
},
{
    198.92,203.24
     you're getting really positive results or feeling really good. But and by
},
{
    203.24,205.14
     positive what he means is that quite
},
{
    205.14,208.08
     often if the pain is going all the way down the leg it might start coming up
},
{
    208.08,212.92
     the leg a little bit it won't go as far. With all these issues the further the
},
{
    212.92,216.96
     pain spreads out the worse it's getting. If your pain is right up in here in the
},
{
    216.96,220.84
     back you know if you can get it back up into the back and staying there even if
},
{
    220.84,224.78
     it's a little worse that's better than a leg pain going down or numbness or
},
{
    224.78,225.64
     tingling going down
},
{
    225.84,229.24
     If you're starting this and you have no symptoms or pain down your leg
},
{
    229.28,234.08
     Then you're gonna look at the back pain and the back pain should feel better or feel like it's going
},
{
    234.08,235.54
     Trinking up, yeah
},
{
    235.54,237.94
     Okay, and number three and final one
},
{
    238.8,240.76
     Can I see that? Yeah, ten of spools.
},
{
    240.76,243.2
     Bob's not hanging on to this just for the fun of it. He's
},
{
    245.36,247.36
     Put to useful work
},
{
    247.6,252.64
     Managing the tennis ball so we didn't lose it. This one you're gonna lay down legs flat
},
{
    253.72,259.14
     Again the figure four but in a flat position just like that and begin right leg
},
{
    259.14,264.16
     It's gonna be the one with the symptoms of pain and you can do a little hip stretch here and see how that goes
},
{
    264.16,270.88
     But the primary part is you get a tennis ball and you're gonna put it, now where you put it you're gonna
},
{
    270.88,274.64
     have to figure out, I mean I know where the purest formus muscle is and I can get to it pretty
},
{
    274.64,279.2
     quickly but if you're not familiar with the anatomy that well you're gonna have to find
},
{
    279.2,283.92
     usually on this it's gonna hurt a little bit, right a little bit of a tender spot, right but
},
{
    283.92,285.82
     you're just gonna leave it on there for about
},
{
    285.92,288.32
     After 30 seconds or so the pain should
},
{
    289.04,295.56
     Decrease notably and you say oh it feels quite a bit better and then if that symptoms down the leg go along with it and they go away
},
{
    296.2,300.88
     Your you know your goal. This is actually an interesting technique Brad. I never I never seen this before
},
{
    300.88,305.6
     I actually will have to try this with some of my patients Sure, yeah, I can see how it would work
},
{
    305.6,308.56
     Yeah, and you can move that tennis ball from site to site
},
{
    308.56,314.64
     You may try four or five different locations and just monitor it again 30 seconds or so roughly
},
{
    314.64,320.7
     And you should start to feel positive results and when you get done and you get up and walk around again
},
{
    321.0,329.44
     If you're at a pain without a five or down to your knee or your ankle if it's up to your buttock area and it's abolished that leg pain you know
},
{
    329.44,334.24
     your goal to continue to do that at least three times a day. At least you
},
{
    334.24,339.92
     could do it even more. And again we emphasize again this should make
},
{
    339.92,347.32
     things better if it makes things worse you stop immediately. And remember Brad, we can fix just
},
{
    347.32,352.8
     about anything. Exactly, what can't we fix? A broken heart. Oh that's right, a broken heart. We don't
},
{
    352.8,356.72
     have a heart, he doesn't even have a heart anymore. Well we're working on that because I'm gonna do some
},
{
    356.72,360.92
     self-study and then I'm gonna read some books and then talk to my wife about a little bit. We'll get
},
{
    360.92,365.88
     it figured out. You probably have his heart in your lab don't you? Yeah. In your workshop. Alright,
},
