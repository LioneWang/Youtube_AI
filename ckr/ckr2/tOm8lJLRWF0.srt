     This video is intended to provide instruction on the appropriate way to apply a tourniquet
},
{
    38.34,41.52
     for massive lower extremity bleeding.
},
{
    41.52,47.0
     The first step is to identify the wound and loop the tourniquet around the limb one to three inches above the wound.
},
{
    47.0,50.0
     Importantly, the tourniquet may be placed over clothing.
},
{
    50.0,56.0
     The second step is to ensure that the tourniquet is looped through the buckle twice.
},
{
    56.0,63.0
     The third step is to pretension the tourniquet. This is done by vigorously pulling on the free end of the tourniquet
},
{
    63.0,65.0
     and tightening it such that a finger cannot be interposed between the tourniquet and tightening it such that
},
{
    65.0,70.0
     a finger cannot be interposed between the tourniquet and the patient's skin.
},
{
    70.0,74.0
     The fourth step is to twist the windlass up to three times or until there is cessation
},
{
    74.0,76.08
     of bleeding.
},
{
    76.08,80.18
     The fifth step is to inspect the wound to ensure there's no ongoing bleeding and to
},
{
    80.18,84.24
     palpate for a distal pulse which should be absent.
},
{
    84.24,87.2
     The sixth step is to achieve hemostasis.
},
{
    87.2,90.96
     Inspect the wound if there is ongoing bleeding, ensure there are three twists in the first
},
{
    90.96,96.16
     tourniquet and apply a second immediately adjacent to and above the first.
},
{
    96.16,100.28
     Once the tourniquet is in place, it should be left up and tight until evaluated by a
},
{
    100.28,105.0
     surgeon at a hospital.
},
{
    108.0,112.0
     Tourniquets can save lives on the battlefield and in the homeland. This instructional video provides the basic necessary information
},
{
    112.0,115.0
     to properly apply a tourniquet for a massively bleeding wound.
},
{
    115.0,119.0
     In my experience, a properly applied tourniquet can save lives.
},
{

     This is a skill set that anybody can master, just like the Heimlich Mover or CBR.
