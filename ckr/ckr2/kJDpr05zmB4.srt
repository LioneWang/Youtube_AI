{
    0.0,7.88
     So if we know that the person is choking on something, what is exactly that we have to
},
{
    7.88,8.88
     do?
},
{
    8.88,11.64
     Okay, so first of all, when someone's choking, they're going to be coughing a lot and that's
},
{
    11.64,12.8
     a good thing.
},
{
    12.8,16.36
     So if the person is already coughing, we're actually going to encourage them to continue
},
{
    16.36,17.36
     coughing.
},
{
    17.36,19.6
     That's the best way to get an object out.
},
{
    19.6,24.36
     And if that's not working and the object becomes completely blocked in their throat and there's
},
{
    24.36,25.68
     no more air exchange, so there's no their throat and there's no more air exchange.
},
{
    25.68,28.84
     So there's no more coughing, there's no more anything than what we would do with the Heimlich
},
{
    28.84,29.84
     Maneuver.
},
{
    29.84,31.24
     And it's very easy to do.
},
{
    31.24,34.16
     So what you're going to do is you're going to tell the person that you're going to come
},
{
    34.16,36.64
     behind them and I'll just undress.
},
{
    36.64,38.36
     You wouldn't normally do that.
},
{
    38.36,42.16
     But just to show you where to put your hands, you're actually going to find the belly button
},
{
    42.16,43.16
     just down below here.
},
{
    43.16,44.16
     Okay.
},
{
    44.16,47.48
     And you're going to put your hands around around right around where the belly button is. You're going to
},
{
    47.48,52.32
     tuck one hand in and bring yourself around, and you're actually going to push your hands
},
{
    52.32,58.08
     in and pull up at the same time and do a J thrust, and you're actually going to be pushing
},
{
    58.08,62.36
     pretty, pretty hard, okay. So you're going to probably be lifting up the person just
},
{
    62.36,66.96
     a little bit, and you're going to continue doing that until the object comes out,
},
{
    66.96,68.96
     or until they fall unconscious.
},
{
    68.96,70.8
     And what happens if the person falls unconscious?
},
{
    70.8,72.4
     If the person falls unconscious,
},
{
    72.4,75.04
     you're going to call 911 immediately,
},
{
    75.04,78.32
     very important, and you'll start the step with CPR.
},
{
    78.32,79.32
     Perfect, thanks.
},
