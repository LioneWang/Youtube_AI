     Hey guys, Dr. Daphne Limburtz, certified laser dermatologist.
},
{
    3.2,7.92
     Hey, you've seen a lot of my videos on acne scarring and cosmetic revision of
},
{
    8.68,10.68
     scars and birthmarks and
},
{
    11.6,15.2
     lots of good stuff and interesting things, but look
},
{
    15.96,21.32
     the brilliant bother of my training as a dermatologist is that of skin checks.
},
{
    21.32,25.08
     Now I've given that up about or four or five years ago as of skin checks. Now, I've given that up about, or four, five years ago,
},
{
    25.08,27.24
     as regular skin checks, but I still do skin checks
},
{
    27.24,29.0
     for the military or ex-military personnel
},
{
    29.0,30.7
     because I'm ex-military myself.
},
{
    30.7,34.88
     So, these patients usually have an extraordinary amount
},
{
    34.88,38.0
     of sun damage, and you'll see shortly what I mean
},
{
    38.0,40.32
     by sun damage and skin cancers,
},
{
    40.32,45.0
     because when you work in the Air Force Army or Navy,
},
{
    45.32,47.34
     they're often restrictions on what you can wear
},
{
    47.34,51.6
     or you can't wear, especially in the 50s, 60s and 70s.
},
{
    51.6,56.36
     And as a result, you can see the immense amount of damage
},
{
    56.36,59.12
     of what UV radiation can do.
},
{
    59.12,61.7
     Typically my patients will have at least
},
{
    61.7,64.48
     at any given time a dozen skin cancers
},
{
    64.48,65.16
     or would have had a
},
{
    65.16,69.44
     couple of hundred skin cancers cut out. So watch this video, he's a really cool
},
{
    69.44,73.04
     guy, I've been looking after him for the last 10 years and you can see the amount
},
{
    73.04,78.32
     of sun damage he has and why it's important to wear sunscreen and do your
},
{
    78.32,82.64
     best to wear hats and really take care of your skin and if you're at high risk
},
{
    82.64,86.48
     see a board certified dermatologist who does regular skin checks.
},
{
    86.48,87.48
     So thanks for that guys.
},
{
    87.48,89.48
     Hey guys this is my mate Barry.
},
{
    89.48,90.48
     How are you Barry?
},
{
    90.48,91.48
     Well thanks yourself.
},
{
    91.48,92.48
     Good, good.
},
{
    92.48,99.44
     You can see very shortly how many skin cancers he's had and I'll take you through a skin
},
{
    99.44,107.52
     check what they look for and stay safe that way. So just as an idea, Barry's had at least 300, 400,
},
{
    107.52,112.96
     yeah, probably 400 sking dancers. Your ex-military used to be in the Air Force, right,
},
{
    112.96,116.8
     from what I remember. Yep. Yep. And with the, being in the Air Force is something
},
{
    116.8,121.36
     called FID, foreign object debris. Is that right? FIDs? Foreign object damage.
},
{
    121.36,127.16
     The air-firing damage. In other words, they kind of wear hats. You couldn't wear sunglasses last time.
},
{
    127.16,128.16
     And the only thing you could have
},
{
    128.16,130.0
     could be earmuffs and that's it.
},
{
    130.0,133.36
     So as a result, he's on the tarmac
},
{
    133.36,135.5
     with the UV exposure, which is ridiculous,
},
{
    135.5,136.88
     much like California.
},
{
    136.88,139.68
     Just imagine that no hats, no sunscreens
},
{
    139.68,141.24
     because you were working on the tarmac
},
{
    141.24,144.08
     at that stage in the 60s and 70s
},
{
    144.08,146.12
     on F1 Lebanon's Long Retire
},
{
    146.12,151.36
     aircraft. But you know, it's amazingly amount of sun damage it has and as a result the
},
{
    151.36,158.16
     consequence of UV damage. So he's a classic example of really bad skin cancers and sun
},
{
    158.16,163.88
     damage and I'll show you the amount of skin cancers he's had and he has at this moment.
},
{
    163.88,169.2
     Okay so quick check over here, you can see he's got a graft over here that's formed by melanoma
},
{
    169.2,174.32
     I presume. Is that melanoma on SCC? SCC. It's a squamous cell castanoma that was probably a
},
{
    174.32,178.24
     couple of decades ago. He's had numerous operations over here. He's had at least,
},
{
    178.96,186.24
     I've operated on you quite a few times in the past. He's had a graft to his nose over here. He's got
},
{
    186.24,190.24
     sun damage everywhere, solar keratosis all the way around here, anything which is rough
},
{
    190.24,195.28
     or unscaly. I have a Prima lignin, so they're called solar keratosis or actinic keratosis
},
{
    195.28,201.6
     in the US. He's got a couple of IECs which are precancerous. He's had scars over here,
},
{
    201.6,207.0
     on the forehead over here, nasal reconstruction over here, down through
},
{
    207.16,214.16
     his ALR down there, he's had carcinomas up on his lip over here, lots and lots of scars
},
{
    214.44,220.08
     everywhere, secondary to BCCs and squamous cell carcinomas. You can see part of his
},
{
    220.08,226.24
     ear is missing and that's secondary to skin cancer as well as skin cancer excursions.
},
{
    226.24,230.24
     This is where we normally take our grafts from, which is a part of the front part of
},
{
    230.24,231.44
     the ear.
},
{
    231.44,236.12
     Moving down to his body, we can see he's got lots of sun damage all over his chest.
},
{
    236.12,238.32
     These areas are pre-cantherous as well.
},
{
    238.32,242.56
     Anything which is rougher and scaly that doesn't go away in six weeks is considered as pre-cantherous
},
{
    242.56,244.68
     until proven otherwise.
},
{
    244.68,247.44
     Numerous scars everywhere from skin cancer there.
},
{
    247.44,253.72
     Cryotherapy here, that's done by a plastic surgeon, so we call it Azoro, Mark was Zed,
},
{
    253.72,258.6
     that's his little flap there for a skin cancer there.
},
{
    258.6,262.56
     Moving down his arms, you can see an immense amount of sun damage, starting all the way
},
{
    262.56,264.36
     from his fingers.
},
{
    264.36,265.36
     All of this is precancer,
},
{
    265.36,270.8
     precancer, pretranser, precancer. Surgical scars over here, all of these are precancerous lesions.
},
{
    271.6,277.52
     Looking at his back, we're going to his back now. We can see he's got lots of spots and dots,
},
{
    277.52,282.8
     but this is where you should see a board certified dermatologist because even though he has lesions
},
{
    282.8,286.56
     like this, which may look nasty, they're not.
},
{
    286.56,289.6
     These are actually age warts or age barnacles.
},
{
    289.6,293.84
     So these are called sebkeratoses, barnacles in the ship of life.
},
{
    293.84,296.04
     So they're indeed actually benign.
},
{
    296.04,297.16
     So they're not dangerous at all.
},
{
    297.16,299.12
     The dangerous ones are the ones you usually can't see.
},
{
    299.12,304.04
     So that's why it's very important if you get a lot of sun exposure to see a dermatologist.
},
{
    304.04,311.7
     You can see the scars there from skin cancers. So even though his back looks kind of like, wow, out
},
{
    311.7,318.56
     there, it's actually quite good because his back is actually age barnacles and age warts.
},
{
    318.56,322.68
     So then if we move down to his legs, we can see what's happened to his legs. So look at
},
{
    322.68,325.04
     the amount of sun damage. This is from a graph,
},
{
    325.04,329.52
     so that's called a split thickness graph, and that's from another graph. So you can see the graph
},
{
    329.52,335.12
     sites. All of these areas here are precancerous. So it's got precancerous areas all the way here,
},
{
    335.12,340.8
     all the way down here, and you can see all the way down. So because you wore shorts, didn't you,
},
{
    340.8,350.84
     mate? Yeah, shorts and t-shirts. Yeah, so in the RAF and the Air Force, Ati was shorts and t-shirts or even a singlet.
},
{
    350.84,352.68
     I wore like four singles here.
},
{
    352.68,357.4
     Yeah, so you can see the amount of sun damage stops around here.
},
{
    357.4,358.4
     His feet are kind of okay.
},
{
    358.4,360.12
     You can see that sharp cut off.
},
{
    360.12,364.64
     So you can see the amount of sun damage due to the UV.
},
{
    364.64,366.32
     And all of these areas here, once again,
},
{
    366.32,368.3
     like I said, they're all precancerous.
},
{
    368.3,371.92
     And these had excisions over here on this calf as well,
},
{
    371.92,374.2
     and excisions over there with a flap repair,
},
{
    374.2,377.2
     over there with a Zoro flap repair, Zed flap repair.
},
{
    377.2,382.2
     So yeah, this is my typical military,
},
{
    382.56,385.0
     or ex-military skin check.
},
{
    385.36,390.36
     So guys, it's really important to get your skin checked.
},
{
    394.08,396.92
     One of the ways we can treat solar keratosis
},
{
    396.92,399.48
     is something called cryotherapy, which is this.
},
{
    399.48,402.22
     So basically we're just freezing off tons of spots
},
{
    402.22,403.72
     in the scheme of things.
},
{
    402.2,403.8
     we're just freezing off time and spots. In the scheme of things,
},
{
    408.04,410.76
     in the scheme of things, what I'm doing with this
},
{
    410.76,413.08
     to treat this amount of sun damage,
},
{
    414.68,415.64
     it's not gonna work guys.
},
{
    415.64,418.0
     So that's when we use other treatments
},
{
    418.0,420.48
     like photodynamic therapy or creams
},
{
    420.48,423.98
     such as five fluoro-urusil or FU-dex.
},
{
    423.98,427.96
     So in the US you have a treatment called LuVan.
},
{
    427.96,430.6
     In Australia we use something called PDT
},
{
    430.6,432.72
     or Phytodynamic Therapy.
},
{
    432.72,435.96
     Basically we use a red light to activate the chemical
},
{
    435.96,438.12
     which kills the pre-campus cells.
},
{
    438.12,440.68
     And Barry's had much of that in the past.
},
{
    440.68,443.68
     Mate, hey, Barry, thanks very much for letting me film you,
},
{
    443.68,444.52
     mate.
},
{
    444.52,445.0
     All right. And any tips for the guys out there who are still sun baking? Mate, hey Barry, thanks very much for letting me film you mate.
},
{
    445.0,452.0
     And any tips for the guys out there who are still sun baking?
},
{
    452.0,454.0
     That's it, sunscreen, yeah?
},
{
    454.0,456.0
     Good idea mate, thanks mate.
},
{
    456.0,457.0
     And lots of it.
},
{
    457.0,458.0
     Lots of it, that's it.
},
{
    458.0,459.0
     That's the best tip.
},
{
    459.0,460.0
     Thanks mate.
},
{
    460.0,463.0
     Okay, so that's it guys.
},
{
    463.0,467.1
     You can see Barry's got it spot on. Use slip slop slap.
},
{
    467.1,474.22
     That was the old slogan in Australia in the 80s. Yeah, slip slop slap. Slip on the
},
{
    474.22,479.68
     t-shirt, slop on some sunscreen and slap on your hat. Something like that. But
},
{
    479.68,484.94
     anyway, slip slop slap is what we used to call in the 80s for sun protection. And
},
{
    484.94,485.0
     it is really important. Make sure if you're at high risk, get your skin checked Slip, Slop, Slap is what we used to call in the 80s for sun protection.
},
{
    485.0,486.6
     And it is really important.
},
{
    486.6,491.36
     Make sure if you're at high risk, get your skin checked because what you can see, what
},
{
    491.36,497.08
     looks nasty on his back is actually fine and what doesn't look nasty is actually precances
},
{
    497.08,498.52
     or cancers.
},
{
    498.52,504.16
     So yeah, get your skin checked by a board certified dermatologist, especially if you're
},
{
    504.16,505.32
     at high risk.
},
{
    505.32,511.68
     And remember, if something that comes up and stays for longer than six weeks, look and
},
{
    511.68,514.96
     doesn't go away, make sure you get it checked because it could be a skin cancer.
},
{
    514.96,518.68
     Hey guys, thanks very much for watching this video and I'll see you again next Saturday.
},
{
    518.68,519.68
