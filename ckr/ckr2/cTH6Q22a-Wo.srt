     So what exercises can you do when your neck pain is brutal?
},
{
    4.72,9.24
     Neck pain is obviously very prevalent especially around now when a lot of
},
{
    9.24,12.6
     people are working from home and in the future many more people might be working
},
{
    12.6,17.16
     from home permanently and they dive into computers and they sit hunched like this
},
{
    17.16,23.0
     and they create a lot of pain in their necks. So I'm going to give you five
},
{
    23.0,27.62
     exercises what you can do to relieve the pressure and the pain in your neck
},
{
    27.68,31.76
     Now on average what you see is a lot of people do some stretches to relieve the pain
},
{
    31.88,32.84
     but
},
{
    32.84,38.28
     Strengthening exercises can also be very very effective in pain relief from the neck
},
{
    38.32,40.6
     So I'll give you two stretches
},
{
    40.6,45.32
     I'll give you three strengthening exercises to do. And those strengthening exercises
},
{
    45.32,50.66
     you can view them a bit like some core exercises for your neck and they strengthen the deep
},
{
    50.66,54.52
     neck muscles. So the ones that go really deep in your neck and essentially stabilise your
},
{
    54.52,57.48
     neck like your core muscles would stabilise your lower back.
},
{
    57.48,62.42
     So let's start with a couple of stretches. I've done these before, you might have seen
},
{
    62.42,66.64
     them before. The first stretch we're going to do is a stretch for the upper trapezius muscle,
},
{
    66.64,69.28
     which runs from the top of your neck to your shoulder.
},
{
    69.28,71.92
     And what you need to do is hold on to your right wrist,
},
{
    72.64,75.12
     pull your wrist down and therefore your shoulder down,
},
{
    75.12,80.16
     and I'll tilt your left ear to your left shoulder and hold this for about 10 seconds,
},
{
    80.16,83.84
     your 10 repetitions and repeat three times, three sets.
},
{
    84.56,88.0
     Yeah, I'll show you the other side. I'm pulling down my left
},
{
    88.0,96.24
     wrist, pull down my left shoulder and I'll tilt my right ear to my right shoulder. Hold this for 10
},
{
    96.24,101.56
     seconds, do 10 repetitions and repeat three times. You could do this on a chair as well,
},
{
    101.56,109.04
     all you need to do is hold on to the seat of your chair, so I'm holding on for example with my right hand to the right seat of the chair and then tilt my head
},
{
    109.04,112.48
     to the left. It's all about keeping your shoulder down, that's all we need to do.
},
{
    113.28,118.64
     Second exercise is the second stretch I'm going to show you is the stretch of the deep neck muscles,
},
{
    118.64,125.28
     so the ones that they attach, they're literally quite high up and they attach the neck to the skull.
},
{
    125.28,127.76
     And what you need to do is create a double chin first.
},
{
    127.76,130.88
     Two fingers on my chin just to help me hit the double chin.
},
{
    130.88,135.76
     And then interlock my fingers back on my skull and pull forward.
},
{
    135.76,140.32
     And you should feel the stretch there.
},
{
    140.32,168.4
     So again, double chin, down, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, ddwych, tension and pain in your neck. The first one is cervical retraction. Again, you're trying
},
{
    168.4,171.92
     to activate those deep muscles in your neck. So what you do is you keep your eyes to the
},
{
    171.92,179.36
     horizon. Take a chin in. Hold this for about two seconds and release. Do eight to ten repetitions.
},
{
    179.36,185.2
     Repeat this three, four times a day. But you need to do this a few times to get some relief. Make sure your shoulders
},
{
    185.2,192.4
     are nice and down. Chin in, there you are, create a double chin. Hold that for 8-10 seconds
},
{
    192.4,199.24
     and relax again. So this exercise number one you can do. Simple exercise, but very effective.
},
{
    199.24,203.04
     Exercise number two, if this doesn't help, and again you need to try to do it a few times,
},
{
    203.04,208.32
     if this doesn't help, do the same thing but then laying down, laying on your back. So the way to do this is like this.
},
{
    210.0,215.68
     Lay on your back, your head is nice and horizontal. Again, chuck your chin in,
},
{
    215.68,225.28
     two fingers on your chin and in like this. Now raise your, keep your chin chucked in, raise your head off the of the bench about two inches.
},
{
    226.64,229.12
     Yeah, and then come back again.
},
{
    230.4,237.28
     So the same thing. So double chin, raise your head off the bench two inches, hold for 10 seconds.
},
{
    237.92,242.16
     Same thing, 10 seconds, 10 repetitions and do this three times.
},
{
    243.44,246.2
     The last exercise I want to show you, very effective
},
{
    246.2,250.8
     exercise as well. You need a little tera band for that, like it's like an elastic
},
{
    250.8,256.8
     band. What you do is wrap it around your head like this, I'm going to hold out
},
{
    256.8,260.76
     to the right side, I'm going to do left the left muscles. Now what you need to do
},
{
    260.76,264.52
     it's all about small movements, it's not about big movements, not about power, it's
},
{
    264.52,265.5
     about small movements. First thing, chak movements, not about power. It's about small movements.
},
{
    265.5,267.36
     First thing, tuck your chin in again,
},
{
    267.36,271.18
     and literally little tilt to the side and back.
},
{
    271.18,274.18
     Second, little tilt to the side and back.
},
{
    274.18,276.84
     10 repetitions, repeat.
},
{
    276.84,278.52
     To hold it, hold it for a few seconds.
},
{
    278.52,279.68
     You're gonna have to hold it too long.
},
{
    279.68,280.68
     Hold it two, three seconds.
},
{
    280.68,282.76
     Come back again, do 10 repetitions and three sets.
},
{
    282.76,283.84
     So, chin in.
},
{
    284.8,290.14
     And now make sure your shoulders stay nice and down, nice and relaxed. Chin in and
},
{
    290.14,292.66
     do the side that's what you need to do. Other side same thing I'll just
},
{
    292.66,300.1
     demonstrate it for completion. Yeah side here side yeah shoulders down nice and
},
{
    300.1,308.68
     down chin in and do the right. As you can see I'm not doing this. Chin in, side,
},
{
    308.68,314.56
     yeah, and the same thing forwards, same thing here, chin in first, chuck your chin in, and
},
{
    314.56,321.96
     then a little bit down, up, and relax. Chin in, down, up, and relax, yeah, keep your shoulders
},
{
    321.96,326.24
     down, chin in, And relax, well done.
},
{
    326.24,330.32
     Same thing here, so hold off for two, three seconds, ten repetitions and do three sets.
},
{
    330.32,331.32
     Well done.
},
{
    331.32,334.66
     Good, these exercises should help you.
},
{
    334.66,338.52
     Combine them with postural things as well, postural awareness, make sure you're sitting
},
{
    338.52,343.92
     upright, make sure you take regular breaks, every 25 minutes, take a five minute break,
},
{
    343.92,344.92
     do some exercises.
},
{
    344.92,348.52
     We talked about the YWTL exercise you can do.
},
{
    348.52,350.68
     There's another video, have a look at that as well.
},
{
    350.68,352.88
     But have these breaks in there,
},
{
    352.88,355.36
     make sure your desk is set up properly.
},
{
    355.36,357.88
     Again, another video, you can look at that as well.
},
{
    357.88,358.92
     So set up your desk properly,
},
{
    358.92,360.88
     take some breaks every 25 minutes.
},
{
    360.88,364.36
     After 100 minutes, take a 20 to 30 second break
},
{
    364.36,366.5
     and it will all help with your leg. Good, they should give you some relief. 5 mennydd, a o'r 100 mennydd yn ystafell y 20-30 sgwm, ac mae'n helpu ar y gweithio.
