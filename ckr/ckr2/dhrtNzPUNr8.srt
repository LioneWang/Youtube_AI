     Snellville, Georgia. I've been involved in the health and safety field for

{
    7.84,12.16
     approximately 15 years. I started out as a lifeguard when I was 15 and
},
{
    12.16,16.8
     eventually became an instructor. I now own Sunshine Safety. What we're going to

     talk about today is how to treat a chemical burn. With a chemical burn, the
},
{
    20.88,24.64
     first thing you want to do is make sure the scene is safe for you to enter. If
},
{
    24.64,30.28
     the scene is not safe, you never enter. Or if the scene ever becomes unsafe,
},
{
    30.28,35.48
     you must leave the scene. If the scene is safe, enter the scene and ask your victim
},
{
    35.48,41.28
     for consent. If consent is received, you may then give care. It is recommended that you
},
{
    41.28,47.68
     now call 911. Once you've got your victim, you do want to make sure that you protect yourself from
},
{
    47.68,51.12
     disease transmission. The way we do that is with gloves.
},
{
    51.12,55.04
     Once you have your gloves applied, you are then going to want to brush away
},
{
    55.04,58.56
     any dry chemical that is located on the victim's skin.
},
{
    58.56,62.4
     When you're brushing away, make sure you brush away from you
},
{
    62.4,67.18
     and away from the victim and do not brush the chemical toward any wind.
},
{
    67.18,69.44
     Once all chemical is removed from the skin,
},
{
    69.44,72.96
     you do want to flush the skin with large amounts of water.
},
{
    72.96,75.48
     Keep flushing the wound until the victim feels
},
{
    75.48,77.52
     some of the burning recede.
},
{
    77.52,80.82
     After flushing the wound, you may want to cover the wound
},
{
    80.82,83.72
     with a wrapping or a dressing to help prevent
},
{
    83.72,85.24
     infection from resulting.
