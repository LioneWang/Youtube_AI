     Welcome back guys, I'm Nick from Active Chiropractic and I want to show you today how to do some
},
{
    10.92,14.92
     scoliosis stretches that will prevent it and also help correct it.
},
{
    14.92,19.0
     So equipment that you need is a swiss ball and a foam roller and if you don't have a
},
{
    19.0,23.24
     foam roller you can use a very thick rolled up towel.
},
{
    23.24,25.24
     So basically just get a foam roller
},
{
    25.24,28.16
     and place it on your side and lying on top of it.
},
{
    28.16,30.76
     Make sure you have the foam roller lying on the apex
},
{
    30.76,34.86
     of the scoliosis, meaning the biggest curve pointing
},
{
    34.86,37.08
     towards the outside of your body.
},
{
    37.08,40.56
     And that way it pushes the force against the scoliosis
},
{
    40.56,43.72
     and as you breathe it mobilizes the spine
},
{
    43.72,45.7
     and mobilizes the rib stare.
},
{
    45.7,49.66
     Now I don't have a bed so basically I use the box.
},
{
    49.66,54.06
     Now why I put my arm off the box is so I could have the space there so I could push more
},
{
    54.06,57.18
     pressure onto the foam roller.
},
{
    57.18,62.7
     Now I really recommend to do about 20 breaths, 20 long breaths and 3 sets of this.
},
{
    62.7,71.18
     Now you want to add more weight to it What you have to do is put your arm over your head and that way you'll add a heaps more weight onto the foam roller
},
{
    71.18,77.72
     Remember to keep your body nice and aligned. I tried to by just using the Swiss ball. It's much better on a bed
},
{
    78.32,81.92
     Now if you do find the foam roller a bit too painful on the body
},
{
    81.92,85.2
     All you need to do is get a nice thick towel and put it across
},
{
    85.2,90.56
     the foam roller like so and then just lie on top of it and the reason why I have my hand there to
},
{
    90.56,94.96
     support my neck is because if you're going to hold that position for a long time you can get quite sore.
},
{
    96.56,101.36
     Now if you don't have a foam roller or the foam roller is too painful against you just use a nice
},
{
    101.36,105.68
     thick towel roll it up nice and tight and then lie on top of that.
},
{
    106.32,112.4
     Now when you lie on top of it, the force of your weight pushes against your convexity of
},
{
    112.4,119.2
     your scoliosis and then mobilizes the scoliosis with the aid of your long breaths. So that way
},
{
    119.2,127.96
     it pushes in and out against your ribs and your spine. And then if you want to add more force, just put your arm over your head like so.
},
{
    127.96,132.28
     It's just like a bit of like a seesaw and the towel acts as a fulcrum and that's where
},
{
    132.28,138.92
     the forces are acting against this choleosis and it helps mobilises that area.
},
{
    138.92,143.32
     Now the foam roller is painful for you and the towel is too painful for you.
},
{
    143.32,144.64
     You can use the swiss ball.
},
{
    144.64,148.44
     Now if they're not too hard and you just want to use the Swiss ball on top of all your other
},
{
    148.44,150.36
     exercises that's fine as well.
},
{
    150.36,156.16
     But the Swiss ball is quite rolly poly meaning that you do need core stability and core strength.
},
{
    156.16,160.56
     But if you don't have the core stability or core strength just use the wall as the stability
},
{
    160.56,161.56
     mechanism.
},
{
    161.56,169.8
     So like for example me, I'll put my feet against the box, you can put your feet against the wall. Now it's just exactly like the exercises from before,
},
{
    169.8,174.4
     just have your arm over the ball like so, and the force of the ball actually goes from
},
{
    174.4,180.6
     the scolariotic area, the convex area, and then if you want to add more force, just have
},
{
    180.6,186.2
     your arm, the one on top, over your head like so. And take 20 deep long
},
{
    186.2,191.28
     breaths and do that three times. And that will mobilise the scoliotic area, so
},
{
    191.28,196.8
     you mobilise the convex area, mobilise your spine and it will help align that spine there.
},
{
    199.2,203.36
     Once again guys, thanks for watching. Now if you do think you got scoliosis, remember go see a
},
{
    203.36,205.6
     professional for example a doctor or a chiropractor
},
{
    205.84,208.12
     Get examined properly and get treated properly
},
{
    208.56,213.92
     Now if you have scoliosis chances are you probably got posterior or anterior tilt issues in the hips
},
{
    214.0,219.9
     So check out that video as well and maybe check out the posture series for example the beach beat the hunchback
