{
    0.0,4.2
     Gosh, what is the old me doing?
},
{
    4.2,10.0
     Give me five minutes and let me show you the best hamstring stretch.
},
{
    10.0,19.72
     Two, welcome back to the channel.
},
{
    19.72,21.48
     Thank you for joining us again this week.
},
{
    21.48,25.76
     We got myself Dr. Michael Lowe, Dr. Rosh Maksuti, both physical therapists today.
},
{
    25.76,30.16
     Really quickly, we're going to talk about hamstring stretching, maybe why you may be
},
{
    30.16,34.72
     doing hamstring stretching, why you may not be doing it. And then more importantly, a better way
},
{
    34.72,39.84
     to do your hamstring stretch. So first of all, typically when we talk about hamstring flexibility,
},
{
    39.84,44.88
     let's go face this way, Rosh. We usually think of like a sit and reach when you're on the ground
},
{
    44.88,45.7
     or a toe touch.
},
{
    45.7,47.38
     So let's go both feet together.
},
{
    47.38,49.18
     And let's just see what a rush is flexibility.
},
{
    49.18,50.14
     It goes as far as you can.
},
{
    50.14,51.12
     Can you touch your toes?
},
{
    51.12,51.96
     Is that as far as you can go?
},
{
    51.96,52.8
     That's all I got.
},
{
    52.8,54.22
     And you're feeling like you're limited.
},
{
    54.22,57.26
     This is the end of a rush is we're gonna say is flexibility
},
{
    57.26,58.54
     and we're gonna take a pause.
},
{
    58.54,60.02
     Now, to give you a comparison,
},
{
    60.02,61.9
     I'm gonna go ahead and stand up now, Raj.
},
{
    61.9,63.22
     I'm gonna go down on mine.
},
{
    63.22,66.16
     So just right now, I can almost get my palms down.
},
{
    66.16,68.76
     This is what we're gonna say my flexibility is.
},
{
    68.76,70.52
     So common knowledge would say,
},
{
    70.52,72.72
     oh, we wanna get more flexible,
},
{
    72.72,74.4
     we're going to stretch our hamstrings.
},
{
    74.4,76.36
     Lots of different ways that we can stretch our hamstrings.
},
{
    76.36,77.36
     Or Rush is showing one of them,
},
{
    77.36,79.84
     we can just do the exact same test.
},
{
    79.84,81.16
     What I'm here to show you guys today
},
{
    81.16,84.88
     is a better way to improve your hamstring flexibility.
},
{
    84.88,86.52
     Doing these static stretches, yes, way to improve your hamstring flexibility. Doing these static stretches, yes,
},
{
    86.52,88.56
     they can improve your hamstring flexibility.
},
{
    88.56,90.08
     If we get on the ground like this
},
{
    90.08,91.88
     and we hold this for 60 seconds,
},
{
    91.88,93.48
     we do this multiple times a day,
},
{
    93.48,95.32
     we do this multiple days a week,
},
{
    95.32,97.6
     we will improve our hamstring flexibility.
},
{
    97.6,98.84
     But that's all we're really gonna do.
},
{
    98.84,101.56
     We're not actually gonna decrease our risk
},
{
    101.56,102.56
     of injuring ourselves
},
{
    102.56,104.48
     and we're not actually gonna improve our performance.
},
{
    104.48,107.32
     So what we're gonna do, we're to go over to the stairs around the corner and
},
{
    107.32,112.16
     show you a better way to stretch your hamstrings to improve your flexibility and also get added
},
{
    112.16,118.2
     benefits to get stronger, decrease your risk of injury and improve performance.
},
{
    118.2,122.04
     There's we just moved into a brand new clinic and it is currently drying.
},
{
    122.04,123.04
     We're in demo mode right now.
},
{
    123.04,124.52
     Let's flip the camera around to show everyone.
},
{
    124.52,125.64
     There's Craig over there. Craig can say hello, but the stairs currently drying. We're in demo mode right now. Let's flip the camera around to show everyone. There's Craig over there.
},
{
    125.64,127.96
     Craig can say hello, but the stairs are drying.
},
{
    127.96,129.38
     So we're gonna stay in this room.
},
{
    129.38,130.96
     That's the reason why we're in this room,
},
{
    130.96,132.52
     showing this video right now.
},
{
    132.52,135.04
     So what I wanna do is a pre-test and a post-test.
},
{
    135.04,136.04
     So both the Roche and I,
},
{
    136.04,136.96
     we kinda showed you guys you're there.
},
{
    136.96,140.2
     We're gonna do a reach down to our toes.
},
{
    140.2,142.04
     So we're still from the side angle again.
},
{
    142.04,147.92
     So get an idea and Roche, reach down as far as you can What do you feel it's a rock hamstrings cool down? He gets maybe
},
{
    148.4,152.02
     All the way up to here on the ground. I'm gonna go do it now. I want to go ahead and stand up
},
{
    152.04,154.48
     Again, I showed you guys that I have pretty good flexibility
},
{
    154.48,161.98
     I'm basically palms on the ground and then now we're gonna go long sit so same thing you get an appreciation of what my hamstring
},
{
    162.08,164.04
     flexibility looks like and again
},
{
    164.04,165.44
     I'm about at the wrist or Ross can go ahead and flexibility looks like. And again, I'm about at the risk.
},
{
    165.44,166.96
     Arash can go ahead and go.
},
{
    166.96,167.96
     Showing off.
},
{
    167.96,168.96
     So again, this is flexibility.
},
{
    168.96,170.6
     This is static flexibility.
},
{
    170.6,171.6
     Just the amount.
},
{
    171.6,172.6
     There we go.
},
{
    172.6,173.6
     So Arash is, yeah.
},
{
    173.6,174.6
     About my knuckles.
},
{
    174.6,176.04
     Right at the knuckles or so.
},
{
    176.04,177.76
     So this is our static flexibility.
},
{
    177.76,181.96
     So we can say, okay, what is limiting ourselves from getting to that point?
},
{
    181.96,186.44
     Yes, it's our hamstring length, but it's also what our nervous system will allow us to do.
},
{
    186.44,187.9
     What we're gonna do is we're gonna show you a little trick.
},
{
    187.9,190.2
     So we got some kettlebells.
},
{
    190.2,191.44
     We'll use these.
},
{
    191.44,193.92
     We're, Arash and I are both gonna do some double leg,
},
{
    193.92,195.96
     or I'm gonna make Arash do this.
},
{
    195.96,197.96
     Arash is gonna do some double leg RDLs.
},
{
    197.96,200.56
     So RDLs, typically, remember,
},
{
    200.56,202.16
     it's the Romanian deadlift with the knee.
},
{
    202.16,204.0
     We're gonna keep a little bit more in extended position.
},
{
    204.0,206.2
     And we're gonna do this to try to add as much stretch
},
{
    206.2,207.8
     to the hamstrings as possible.
},
{
    207.8,209.6
     So a big key on this is a rush needs
},
{
    209.6,212.2
     to try to keep his pelvis as still as possible.
},
{
    212.2,213.88
     If he's not, he can easily probably
},
{
    213.88,216.68
     reach the RDL to the ground if he gets it through his low back.
},
{
    216.68,218.48
     But if we want to try to stretch the hamstrings,
},
{
    218.48,221.36
     he's going to keep all that tension in his posterior chain.
},
{
    221.36,222.68
     Get it stretched in his hamstrings.
},
{
    222.68,224.68
     Let's go slow, five-second lower.
},
{
    224.68,226.84
     Let's hold the bottom for about three seconds.
},
{
    226.84,228.12
     Really feel that pull.
},
{
    228.12,230.16
     Use that weight to pull you down
},
{
    230.16,231.84
     to give yourself that hamstring stretch.
},
{
    231.84,232.68
     And then we're gonna come up.
},
{
    232.68,234.44
     Rasha's gonna do maybe eight reps.
},
{
    234.44,236.0
     Well, yeah, we'll keep it really light.
},
{
    236.0,237.46
     And then we're gonna re-measure.
},
{
    237.46,238.96
     And I'm gonna tell you,
},
{
    238.96,240.16
     I guarantee what we're gonna see
},
{
    240.16,242.72
     is in an increase in the amount of flexibility
},
{
    242.72,243.8
     that Rasha has.
},
{
    243.8,245.52
     And again, if we didn't do any magic,
},
{
    245.52,247.22
     his hamstrings then all of a sudden get longer.
},
{
    247.22,250.16
     We just changed what his brain is allowing him to do.
},
{
    250.16,252.04
     His brain's gonna allow him to actually reach
},
{
    252.04,255.32
     a little bit further just by doing something like this.
},
{
    255.32,256.6
     And we're gonna talk a little bit more
},
{
    256.6,258.2
     about what tightness really is
},
{
    258.2,260.44
     and what that kinda means when we say
},
{
    260.44,262.52
     that we experienced tightness.
},
{
    262.52,264.32
     So where are you at right now?
},
{
    264.32,268.78
     Probably at seven right here. Maybe one last one. Let's do one more. It's crazy. I can feel a huge
},
{
    268.78,273.14
     difference in just being able to get lower and lower each repetition. 30 seconds, 45
},
{
    273.14,278.42
     seconds. Okay, good. So, get up all down. So let's do, let's just do the standing one
},
{
    278.42,285.28
     first. So, getting our appreciation. I think standing, he was around here. Go ahead. Where yet?
},
{
    285.28,286.28
     Okay.
},
{
    286.28,287.28
     A little bit further.
},
{
    287.28,288.28
     A little bit further.
},
{
    288.28,292.2
     Maybe hard to tell from the video who knows how hard it is to tell, but definitely a little
},
{
    292.2,293.2
     bit further.
},
{
    293.2,294.2
     Poms touching my toes.
},
{
    294.2,295.2
     And let's go now long sitting.
},
{
    295.2,297.08
     Getting an appreciation for what that looks like.
},
{
    297.08,299.08
     Cameras on a side view.
},
{
    299.08,300.08
     Nice.
},
{
    300.08,301.08
     Yeah.
},
{
    301.08,302.68
     So we went from knuckles.
},
{
    302.68,305.6
     We maybe gained about an inch in a matter of 30 seconds. And
},
{
    305.6,309.84
     again, his hamstring system get longer, but his nervous system is now allowing him to
},
{
    309.84,314.24
     get there. So a lot of times this tightness that we feel like, oh, my hamstrings are tight,
},
{
    314.24,317.36
     my calves are tight, my thing, like what is something that feels as tight. It's just our
},
{
    317.36,321.2
     brain telling us that, Hey, it may not be used to whatever range of motion we're putting
},
{
    321.2,327.72
     in. So we can stretch. And I guarantee that if Rosh and I, if we just did static stretching and we were down here the
},
{
    327.72,331.68
     entire time for about a minute for the same amount of time, we may see the same
},
{
    331.68,336.12
     increases in range of motion that we just did through this loaded dynamic
},
{
    336.12,340.28
     stretching. But with doing something like this, not only are we increasing our
},
{
    340.28,344.88
     flexibility, we're actually working on getting our hamstrings stronger. And over
},
{
    344.88,345.44
     time, we do eccentric training like this our hamstrings stronger. And over time, when we do
},
{
    345.44,349.44
     eccentric training like this, not only do we see that flexibility increases, which is the goal of
},
{
    349.44,353.12
     stretching, but we actually can decrease our risk of injuries, things like hamstring strains, because
},
{
    353.12,357.44
     we're actually getting the hamstring stronger. So hamstrings are easy to demonstrate, but this
},
{
    357.44,361.2
     applies to all different muscle groups. There's nothing wrong with stretching. Tommy, one of our
},
{
    361.2,365.38
     writers, check out him over here. Great blog, great podcast.
},
{
    365.38,366.7
     Hope it's not on Arash's face.
},
{
    366.7,369.58
     We've had a really good article on what stretching is
},
{
    369.58,371.02
     and what stretching isn't.
},
{
    371.02,372.78
     And more importantly, most people stretch,
},
{
    372.78,374.3
     they stretch for the wrong reasons.
},
{
    374.3,376.1
     If you're stretching just to get flexible, go for it.
},
{
    376.1,378.26
     But if you're stretching to improve your performance
},
{
    378.26,380.14
     or decrease your risk of injury,
},
{
    380.14,381.66
     it's time to rethink that.
},
{
    381.66,383.5
     All right, hopefully you guys enjoyed
},
{
    383.5,385.0
