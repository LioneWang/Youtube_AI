     Hey everybody, it's Doctor Jo and Mr. Bear and today I'm going to show you a 5-minute knee
},
{
    5.36,8.32
     exercise routine in real time. So let's get started.
},
{
    14.0,17.6
     Before we get started, if you haven't already, make sure and click on the subscribe button
},
{
    17.6,21.12
     and make sure your subscription is public or let me know that you're a subscriber because if you
},
{
    21.12,28.2
     have a question or comment, I always try and respond to my subscribers. So I'm gonna start off with a 45 second warmup and
},
{
    28.2,32.4
     kind of tell you what I'm doing as I go but you'll need a resistive band. It
},
{
    32.4,36.6
     doesn't have to be a loop band but loop bands are easier and then either a ball,
},
{
    36.6,40.72
     a yoga block or a pillow that you can double up where you're gonna be squeezing
},
{
    40.72,48.94
     into. So let's just start with the 45 second warmup here and it can be something easy with just starting off with kind of a hip
},
{
    48.94,52.56
     flexion because that's going to get those knees bending a little bit and we'll
},
{
    52.56,57.0
     start off with that. So each exercise we're going to do two 30 second groups
},
{
    57.0,61.2
     and then we'll do a little short break in between each set and then a long break
},
{
    61.2,69.64
     in between the exercises just to give ourselves some time to reset. You can also do long arc quads just kind of kicking out again
},
{
    69.64,73.98
     kind of loosening everything up getting those quads working stretching out those
},
{
    73.98,79.6
     hamstrings in the back and then just to end you can do a little bit of heel-toe
},
{
    79.6,83.36
     raises that's going to kind of get the calves but the calf muscles come up and
},
{
    83.36,88.88
     cross the knee joints so those are important to get as well. So I'm going to start with
},
{
    88.88,94.12
     the band around my feet and just my my feet about hip width apart and we're
},
{
    94.12,98.32
     just going to start off this is technically a hip flexion exercise but
},
{
    98.32,103.8
     it's really working your knees as well because all these muscles are connected
},
{
    103.8,106.0
     to the knee as well as the hip area.
},
{
    106.0,112.96
     So I'm really working my knees when I'm doing this one as well. With the resistive bands,
},
{
    112.96,119.28
     you want it to be challenging but you don't want it to be so hard that you can't control it.
},
{
    119.28,123.04
     If you're sitting there and you're shaking or you can't bring your legs all the way up,
},
{
    123.04,127.04
     the resistive band is probably a little bit too hard and you always want to be
},
{
    127.04,132.68
     controlling that band. So when I come up, if I'm wiggling like this or my legs
},
{
    132.68,137.56
     coming in, then again that band is probably too much, your muscles aren't
},
{
    137.56,142.88
     quite ready for that much resistance. So if you're making the loop yourself, you
},
{
    142.88,148.68
     can make the loop a little bit bigger and that will make it a little bit easier to do. So again just kind of
},
{
    148.68,153.16
     getting that movement in there, but try and keep your feet about hip width apart
},
{
    153.16,157.12
     the whole time. Don't let them come in while you're pulling up. That's a part
},
{
    157.12,163.72
     of the exercise for the knees. So then the next one, I'm gonna kind of move the
},
{
    163.72,166.8
     band up to my ankle area instead of my
},
{
    166.8,172.92
     foot so we can do a little knee extension exercise or get that quad working.
},
{
    172.92,178.6
     So I'm still stepping on it on this side and now I'm just kicking up and slowly coming
},
{
    178.6,180.24
     back down.
},
{
    180.24,187.28
     So again, if I go fast, I'm not really getting a good exercise. I want to be able to control that
},
{
    187.28,195.12
     band, really feel that muscle activating. I like doing it for a certain amount of time instead of
},
{
    195.12,200.0
     reps because then you can just kind of go at your own pace if you have to slow down a little bit
},
{
    200.0,207.92
     you can and then you can even challenge yourself by saying, hey, you know, I did maybe five this round.
},
{
    207.92,209.96
     Tomorrow when I do, I'm gonna try and do seven.
},
{
    209.96,212.48
     So you can kind of give yourself a little goal
},
{
    212.48,213.84
     or a challenge while you're doing it
},
{
    213.84,215.96
     to make yourself work a little bit more.
},
{
    215.96,217.36
     So now I just switch sides.
},
{
    217.36,220.6
     So it's around my ankle on this side, coming up.
},
{
    220.6,223.24
     You really wanna get your leg as straight as you can.
},
{
    223.24,228.28
     And sometimes even if you pull your toes up, that helps kind of lock everything out as well but if
},
{
    228.28,233.04
     you're only coming to here you probably have too much resistance in your band.
},
{
    233.04,237.88
     You really want to be able to come up so even if you don't have a band at all
},
{
    237.88,245.0
     and it's challenging don't use the band just do that knee extension or that long arm quad.
},
{
    245.0,251.6
     So now we're gonna go into bringing it all the way up to just above the knees.
},
{
    251.6,255.6
     So this is gonna be, you might have seen me doing it lying down sometimes,
},
{
    255.6,260.2
     where you're opening both legs up almost like a butterfly, but this is unseated.
},
{
    260.2,267.64
     So your feet can be together, they can be a little bit apart, but you're just going to roll both out and slowly come back in. So now you're getting those
},
{
    267.64,272.68
     outer muscles that come down and cross that knee joint. So really working the
},
{
    272.68,278.4
     knee, getting them stronger, nice and going out and controlling it coming back
},
{
    278.4,282.92
     in. So again, if you feel like you're you know shaking and doing this, that
},
{
    282.92,288.04
     probably means it's just a little bit too much and you can try it without the band and then work your way
},
{
    288.04,294.12
     up just a little bit. A little short break in between and then you know these
},
{
    294.12,297.44
     muscles on the outside cross the knee joint and they come all the way up to
},
{
    297.44,302.72
     the hip so that's why it's important for all of it and again if you can't get out
},
{
    302.72,305.32
     as far as me that's okay you just kind of work yourself up, if you can't get out as far as me, that's okay. You just kind of
},
{
    305.32,309.8
     work yourself up to what you can do. So if you can only go to here, as long as
},
{
    309.8,314.36
     you control the band, that's okay. And then each time, trying to work your way
},
{
    314.36,319.96
     a little bit further out and then nice and slow coming back in. It's all about
},
{
    319.96,330.56
     the control of the band.
},
{
    338.48,341.6
     All right so next we're gonna have either the ball, the pillow, a yoga block. Those always work well but it's just going to be in between. So now we're
},
{
    341.6,344.96
     going to work those inner thigh muscles that come all the way down to the knee
},
{
    344.96,346.02
     as well. So with this one all you those inner thigh muscles that come all the way down to the knee as well.
},
{
    346.02,347.46
     So with this one, all you're gonna do
},
{
    347.46,350.74
     is just kind of squeeze in to get that hold
},
{
    350.74,354.34
     and maybe hold it for three to five seconds and then relax.
},
{
    354.34,356.9
     So you don't have to do hold out, hold out.
},
{
    356.9,360.38
     Do a little pause in between kind of those isometric exercises
},
{
    360.38,366.24
     and I'm gonna take a moment to smile for my thumbnail just so you can see that
},
{
    366.24,370.32
     and you can take a picture at the same time if you want but again squeezing in
},
{
    370.32,374.36
     three to five seconds if you can only start off with two seconds that's fine
},
{
    374.36,379.8
     and then take a little break I would again hold it for two to three seconds
},
{
    379.8,383.72
     if that's all you can do but don't go at a hundred percent your first time just
},
{
    383.72,390.28
     start off with maybe even 30 to 40 percent pushing in and then relaxing and then each time you can
},
{
    390.28,395.12
     push a little bit harder and your goal can be you know today I was able to hold
},
{
    395.12,399.56
     it for five seconds maybe tomorrow I'll be able to hold it for seven seconds so
},
{
    399.56,413.16
     again you know if you like having goals and building yourself up to goals you can do that as well and just doing that squeeze and then coming out. Who is that?
},
{
    413.16,419.56
     Alright so the last one is gonna be just a hamstring set and so with that
},
{
    419.56,423.68
     hamstring set it's again you're not gonna be making a big movement like with
},
{
    423.68,428.56
     the ball you're squeezing but you're not actually making a huge movement. So I'm just
},
{
    428.56,433.24
     going to put my heel down on the floor and I'm going to push down like I'm
},
{
    433.24,437.76
     trying to pull my foot back in but I'm pushing down into the floor and then
},
{
    437.76,442.24
     I'm holding that again for that two to three three to five seconds and I'm
},
{
    442.24,452.34
     feeling my hamstring activate while I'm doing that. So just pushing down and in, holding it, relax, take a little quick break and then
},
{
    452.34,457.32
     push back down into it again. So again the movement I'm trying to do is that
},
{
    457.32,462.8
     but I'm pushing down into the floor and then so we'll switch sides. So you know
},
{
    462.8,468.04
     again you don't have to do a whole lot of them but the hold to activate those muscles is what you really want to
},
{
    468.04,473.5
     do. So again I'm trying to almost pull in but I'm pushing it into the floor. The
},
{
    473.5,477.46
     floor is stopping me from pulling that foot all the way in and those hamstring
},
{
    477.46,481.44
     muscles are the ones that I'm working right there. So again if two to three
},
{
    481.44,485.84
     seconds at 30 to 40% is all you can do right now, that's okay.
},
{
    485.84,488.92
     And then you can kind of slowly work your way up to that one.
},
{
    488.92,493.6
     So pull, pull, pull, pull, and relax.
},
{
    493.6,498.56
     And so sometimes hamstrings want to cramp up a little bit, so I would say maybe even pull
},
{
    498.56,502.08
     a little bit less with this one and see how it feels.
},
{
    502.08,503.08
     So there you have it.
},
{
    503.08,507.64
