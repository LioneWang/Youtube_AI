     If I was to give exercise advice to my younger self,
},
{
    3.56,7.6
     here are the four most undervalued exercises
},
{
    7.6,9.64
     that I wish I had known about at that time.
},
{
    11.96,14.44
     Arash Maksudi, doctor of physical therapy.
},
{
    14.44,16.6
     Today I'm gonna go over four exercises
},
{
    16.6,18.52
     that I wish I had known about.
},
{
    18.52,21.24
     Let's start with exercise number one, the face pull.
},
{
    21.24,25.56
     So the face pull, very basic exercise, but very high yield.
},
{
    25.56,27.84
     We get a lot of scapula and shoulder muscles
},
{
    27.84,29.0
     all in one here.
},
{
    29.0,31.1
     So we come here, have a band
},
{
    31.1,34.18
     anchored on a stable surface,
},
{
    34.18,36.94
     and you're pulling the band up towards your forehead.
},
{
    36.94,38.22
     And what you wanna focus on here
},
{
    38.22,39.52
     is not just pulling back,
},
{
    39.52,41.98
     but you're rotating your shoulders externally as well
},
{
    41.98,43.68
     so that the band comes up to your forehead.
},
{
    43.68,45.76
     You can see how the band kind of kisses my forehead there.
},
{
    46.4,51.36
     And I'm coming back and forth. And not only will I feel my shoulder blade muscles work,
},
{
    51.36,56.24
     but the back of my shoulder is going to work a ton. And now with this band, I'm also spreading it
},
{
    56.24,61.36
     apart. So I'm pulling my hands apart as well. I'm not just coming here, but I'm spreading the band
},
{
    61.36,66.4
     like this. That'll really make sure that the back of the shoulder works a ton.
},
{
    66.4,67.32
     So that's the first one.
},
{
    67.32,70.68
     The second one, we'll go into this inverted
},
{
    70.68,73.72
     kettlebell military press where I have myself
},
{
    73.72,76.04
     in a split stance position to start off with,
},
{
    76.04,79.8
     and then I come up into this 90-90 position,
},
{
    79.8,83.08
     kettlebell stabilized, and then I push overhead.
},
{
    83.08,89.56
     And I'm making sure my scapula muscles are all engaged too and I come back down here and I push overhead and
},
{
    89.56,94.36
     if you want feel free to use your body to rotate into this and get your whole
},
{
    94.36,99.4
     body into it you're gonna have to even stabilize from down below and you'll
},
{
    99.4,105.12
     feel really the whole body work with this but a ton of shoulder engagement.
},
{
    105.12,112.16
     Exercise number three is a modified version of the Copenhagen Plank on an elevated surface.
},
{
    112.16,117.44
     The reason I say it's modified is because I want you guys to add a trunk twist into this.
},
{
    117.44,130.62
     So I'm stabilized here, shoulder is strong, my elevated leg is working, primarily my adductors Now what I'm going to do is go down bring my chest towards the floor and then pull myself back up
},
{
    130.62,133.46
     I slowly rotate my body towards the floor
},
{
    133.86,140.22
     Make sure this leg stays strong and then I pull up using a lot of these muscles here. So again in real time
},
{
    140.9,142.34
     Going like this
},
{
    142.34,143.78
     pulling up
},
{
    143.78,146.88
     going down, pulling up.
},
{
    146.88,151.56
     And so the groin on the side of the leg that's working will really be lit up after a few
},
{
    151.56,152.86
     reps there.
},
{
    152.86,158.08
     And the last one, kind of a common exercise, but if you do it right, you'll feel a great
},
{
    158.08,163.52
     burn is a modified side plank plus the clam.
},
{
    163.52,166.64
     So same position, but you're gonna be on the floor.
},
{
    166.64,169.04
     You're on your elbow, you're on your knees.
},
{
    169.04,171.48
     And then you're gonna come up to this side plank position,
},
{
    171.48,174.44
     but at the same time, you're gonna open your legs up.
},
{
    174.44,176.96
     Now the key here is to thrust your hips forward.
},
{
    176.96,179.6
     A lot of times people kinda do this kinda thing,
},
{
    179.6,181.12
     and you're not gonna really get the glutes
},
{
    181.12,183.0
     as much as you would if you thrust forward
},
{
    183.0,184.24
     at the same time.
},
{
    184.24,188.7
     So as I do this, my bottom glute is working hard. The top glue is
},
{
    188.7,193.26
     working too, but my bottom one is really doing a lot of the work here. And then you
},
{
    193.26,197.64
     come back down. And after a few reps here, if you do it right, you should really
},
{
    197.64,201.84
     feel a burn. What I really like people to focus on at the end too is squeeze the
},
{
    201.84,205.44
     glue, hold for a good second, and then come back down.
},
{
    205.44,209.44
     So you're not just wrapping it out like this, but you're actually getting a lot of time
},
{
    209.44,211.02
     under tension.
},
{
    211.02,219.08
     So four very basic exercises, but can really help a ton, especially in the prehab world.
},
{
    219.08,223.32
     Not necessarily do you have to do these every time, but I like these for people as either
},
{
    223.32,225.56
     a warm up, a movement preparation,
},
{
    225.56,227.84
     or it can be people's exercises through a routine.
},
{
    227.84,231.48
     So try these four exercises, let us know what you think.
