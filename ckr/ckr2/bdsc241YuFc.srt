     Bob and Brad, the two most famous physical therapists
},
{
    6.72,8.04
     on the internet.
},
{
    11.3,13.16
     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.
},
{
    13.16,14.5
     Brad Heineck, physical therapist.
},
{
    14.5,16.22
     We are the most famous physical therapists on the internet.
},
{
    16.22,17.4
     In our opinion, of course, Bob.
},
{
    17.4,19.78
     What you didn't see on camera, I just said, hi folks.
},
{
    19.78,21.4
     Okay, the first thing we're gonna talk about
},
{
    21.4,24.44
     is the first sign you are getting arthritis
},
{
    24.44,27.68
     in your shoulder, hip, or knee.
},
{
    27.68,29.0
     It's a do-it-yourself test.
},
{
    29.0,30.4
     What I'm trying to do here, Brad,
},
{
    30.4,32.12
     is I'm trying to eliminate our jobs.
},
{
    32.12,33.2
     I'm trying to make sure people
},
{
    33.2,34.8
     don't need physical therapists anymore.
},
{
    34.8,38.12
     Well, that's it, because once we retire,
},
{
    38.12,39.32
     what else, what else?
},
{
    39.32,41.52
     Yeah, right, once we retire, we don't need anybody else.
},
{
    41.52,42.8
     There's nothing left over.
},
{
    42.8,44.4

     Go to BobandBrad.com, go to the giveaway section,
},
{
    52.44,54.84
     because this week we're giving away a mattress.
},
{
    54.84,55.68
     Whoa!
},
{
    55.68,58.28
     A sleep-evasion mattress, awesome mattress.
},
{
    58.28,59.64
     This is just a sample of it.
},
{
    59.64,61.08
     It's not this small.
},
{
    61.08,63.24
     You don't have to be a dog or anything like that.
},
{
    63.24,64.28
     And it has a cover.
},
{
    64.28,67.0
     Yeah, it has a cover, and it's got individual mattresses
},
{
    67.0,69.64
     and air channels and it's very comfortable
},
{
    69.64,71.64
     if you're having pain.
},
{
    71.64,72.58
     Even if you're not.
},
{
    72.58,75.72
     Yeah, go to Facebook, the contest will be pinned
},
{
    75.72,78.92
     to the top of the page, Instagram, TikTok or Twitter
},
{
    78.92,81.24
     if you want a 60 second version of our program.
},
{
    81.24,84.64
     Oh, by the way, we're getting away a couple of pillows too
},
{
    84.64,86.96
     and they have springs in them.
},
{
    86.96,88.36
     But they're really comfortable.
},
{
    88.36,90.2
     Yeah, they're very, very nice pillows.
},
{
    90.2,92.08
     Really good for side sleepers, that's what I think.
},
{
    92.08,93.0
     Yeah, I agree.
},
{
    93.0,94.52
     Okay, carry on.
},
{
    94.52,97.22
     All right, this is based in part on the work
},
{
    97.22,99.64
     of James Siriax, who's considered the father
},
{
    99.64,101.68
     of orthopedic medicine.
},
{
    101.68,103.28
     He says when you're starting to get,
},
{
    103.28,104.64
     and we see this too,
},
{
    104.64,106.72
     when you start to get arthritis,
},
{
    106.72,110.64
     the joint starts to lose motion in a certain pattern,
},
{
    110.64,112.16
     which we call a capsular pattern.
},
{
    112.16,115.24
     And this will become more clear as we show you.
},
{
    115.24,117.28
     So we're gonna show you the pattern for the shoulder,
},
{
    117.28,119.6
     the hip, the knee, or the elbow.
},
{
    119.6,120.96
     Well, I didn't have elbow.
},
{
    120.96,122.96
     I guess we can mention elbow if you want.
},
{
    124.52,127.16
     So before we do that though,
},
{
    127.16,130.4
     you should probably answer these questions
},
{
    130.4,132.24
     because if these aren't true,
},
{
    132.24,133.84
     you probably don't have arthritis.
},
{
    133.84,136.46
     If you're not older,
},
{
    136.46,138.28
     it's unlikely you have arthritis.
},
{
    138.28,139.12
     Although-
},
{
    139.12,139.96
     What's older, Bob?
},
{
    139.96,143.76
     Well, pushing maybe 40, 50, 60.
},
{
    143.76,145.88
     Yeah, if you're maybe up in your 40s,
},
{
    145.88,147.98
     you might, you know, there may be some conditions
},
{
    147.98,149.4
     that people will develop earlier,
},
{
    149.4,151.3
     but we're talking about general public.
},
{
    151.3,153.78
     Yeah, a lot of times, especially if you enter the joints.
},
{
    153.78,154.62
     Sometimes you get-
},
{
    154.62,156.96
     Yeah, it'll get arthritic earlier.
},
{
    156.96,158.22
     Right.
},
{
    158.22,162.58
     Generally too, arthritis is a gradual onset of pain
},
{
    162.58,163.46
     and stiffness.
},
{
    163.46,166.14
     I can't tell you how many times that in my lifetime, Brad,
},
{
    166.14,169.74
     I'm a clinic, somebody come in and they go,
},
{
    169.74,172.58
     well, the doctor I said I have arthritis in the shoulder.
},
{
    172.58,174.26
     I go, when did it start?
},
{
    174.26,176.1
     Well, it started two days ago.
},
{
    176.1,177.5
     I go, did you have any pain before that?
},
{
    177.5,178.34
     No.
},
{
    178.34,179.62
     It's like, it's not arthritis.
},
{
    179.62,181.38
     Arthritis doesn't start in two days.
},
{
    181.38,183.62
     You know, it takes a long time.
},
{
    183.62,185.72
     You start noticing the days. You know, it takes a long time. You start noticing the stuff.
},
{
    185.72,186.56
     You know.
},
{
    186.56,190.4
     Yeah, the cartilage begins to deteriorate or wear over time.
},
{
    190.4,192.2
     Other signs you have arthritis,
},
{
    192.2,195.32
     that there's grinding or clicking or cracking.
},
{
    195.32,197.28
     You know, again, the wearing of the cartilage.
},
{
    197.28,199.2
     Right, right, we call that crepitus.
},
{
    199.2,201.36
     So let's say you have all those things.
},
{
    201.36,204.2
     So the first sign, let's talk about the hip first.
},
{
    204.2,206.8
     The first thing, the first sign you have arthritis
},
{
    206.8,209.04
     in your hip is you're gonna lose what we call
},
{
    209.04,211.36
     is hip internal rotation.
},
{
    211.36,213.04
     Very simple to test.
},
{
    213.04,216.52
     You're gonna sit up on a high surface.
},
{
    216.52,217.6
     So your feet dangle.
},
{
    217.6,218.64
     So your feet dangle.
},
{
    218.64,221.08
     And all you're gonna do is your knees are bent
},
{
    221.08,223.44
     at a right angle and you're gonna turn your legs out
},
{
    223.44,224.28
     like this.
},
{
    224.28,226.48
     And you can see I don't have a lot of hip external,
},
{
    226.48,227.92
     internal rotation, do I Brad?
},
{
    227.92,229.08
     I don't either.
},
{
    229.08,232.28
     Nope, that's, I got really good external rotation personally.
},
{
    232.28,235.24
     Yeah, you never did have internal rotation.
},
{
    235.24,238.0
     But if you look at one and one goes out to here
},
{
    238.0,241.4
     and your other one doesn't go near as far,
},
{
    241.4,243.04
     that doesn't mean you have arthritis.
},
{
    243.04,245.76
     It means, you know, it's a positive indication.
},
{
    245.76,247.72
     There's three different tests for the hip.
},
{
    247.72,248.56
     That's right.
},
{
    248.56,249.4
     Right, right.
},
{
    249.4,252.32
     So that's one is that, if you're losing that motion,
},
{
    252.32,255.0
     again, if you have one that's worse than the other,
},
{
    255.0,258.36
     we'd expect that one that's motion to be worse than the other.
},
{
    258.36,262.4
     I mean, probably a normal person could go out to about here.
},
{
    262.4,264.32
     But again, you gotta keep your butt down.
},
{
    264.32,265.84
     You can't cheat like this.
},
{
    265.84,268.2
     You have to actually go like that.
},
{
    268.2,272.44
     All right, the next sign of the hip,
},
{
    272.44,274.56
     that was the number one sign.
},
{
    274.56,276.96
     The next one would be a loss of hip flexion.
},
{
    276.96,280.0
     So that's just bending the leg up like this.
},
{
    280.0,283.08
     Now, you can do it seated,
},
{
    284.24,286.38
     or you can also lie down.
},
{
    286.38,288.56
     And what's nice about lying down, Brad,
},
{
    288.56,290.12
     then you can kind of compare.
},
{
    290.12,292.72
     You say, okay, that one goes that far.
},
{
    294.32,295.36
     This one goes farther.
},
{
    295.36,297.12
     This one, let's go farther.
},
{
    297.12,299.8
     Well, your right hip is a little on the fritz, isn't it?
},
{
    299.8,300.64
     Yep, yep.
},
{
    300.64,301.92
     It's the one that always gives me trouble.
},
{
    301.92,302.76
     Yep.
},
{
    302.76,304.52
     So you might have some arthritis in there, Bob.
},
{
    304.52,305.36
     I would guess. I would guess. Don't worry about it. Sorry, that's the sign that always gives me trouble. Yep, so. You might have some arthritis in there, Bob. I would guess.
},
{
    305.36,306.2
     I would guess.
},
{
    306.2,307.04
     Don't worry about it.
},
{
    307.04,308.44
     Sorry, that's the sign.
},
{
    308.44,309.4
     It'll get better.
},
{
    309.4,310.88
     It'll get better.
},
{
    310.88,313.28
     All right, the last one, again,
},
{
    313.28,314.48
     so it kind of goes in our first,
},
{
    314.48,316.76
     you'll see hip internal rotation affected,
},
{
    316.76,319.8
     then hip flexion, last one is hip abduction,
},
{
    319.8,322.44
     and that's just going straight out to the side.
},
{
    322.44,325.52
     So you could do this line on the floor,
},
{
    325.52,326.44
     you could do it on the bed,
},
{
    326.44,327.96
     but you're just gonna take one hip out
},
{
    327.96,330.4
     and go out as far as you can go.
},
{
    330.4,333.28
     Kinda notice how far out it is.
},
{
    333.28,335.08
     And then take the other one out.
},
{
    335.08,336.24
     I'm gonna hit the wall.
},
{
    337.28,338.52
     Oh, as far as you can go.
},
{
    338.52,340.52
     Right, so obviously, you know,
},
{
    340.52,343.16
     sheets off, you're laying on top of the bed covers.
},
{
    343.16,344.32
     I could tell.
},
{
    344.32,348.24
     And the other thing is, when you test these motions,
},
{
    348.24,350.96
     you'll feel like the ones that are tighter,
},
{
    350.96,352.92
     you're hitting against the wall a little bit.
},
{
    352.92,354.2
     It'll feel tighter.
},
{
    354.2,355.48
     Or you might have that crepitus,
},
{
    355.48,359.56
     some grinding, popping, and that was kind of sensations.
},
{
    359.56,361.28
     So if you look at your hip,
},
{
    361.28,364.0
     and it's really lost internal rotation,
},
{
    364.0,365.28
     compared to the other side.
},
{
    365.28,368.78
     Yeah, you know, and you lost some of those other motions too.
},
{
    368.78,371.8
     There's a sign you might have arthritis.
},
{
    371.8,373.84
     First sign of shoulder.
},
{
    373.84,376.04
     The first thing you lose on shoulder motion
},
{
    376.04,378.16
     is often external rotation.
},
{
    378.16,379.68
     So let me show you how to do that one.
},
{
    379.68,382.74
     The best way to do it is to do that one lying down.
},
{
    382.74,385.0
     So you bring your arms out, if you can,
},
{
    385.0,387.24
     to about a right angle.
},
{
    387.24,388.08
     Straight out.
},
{
    388.08,389.88
     Straight out, yep.
},
{
    389.88,392.76
     And you have your elbows at a right angle,
},
{
    392.76,394.48
     a 90 degree angle, yep.
},
{
    394.48,395.8
     Both sides.
},
{
    395.8,398.2
     And you're gonna go like this, in this test.
},
{
    398.2,402.0
     Now I go all the way down to the surface,
},
{
    402.0,405.16
     so I'm not worried about external rotation on this one.
},
{
    405.16,406.8
     If you've had an injury in the past,
},
{
    406.8,408.36
     you can see I can even go further.
},
{
    408.36,410.66
     Yeah, you may have a tight shoulder.
},
{
    412.04,414.32
     I think, well, I guess mine are about equal.
},
{
    414.32,417.52
     I thought one of mine was tighter from an injury.
},
{
    417.52,420.5
     All right, the next one is,
},
{
    420.5,422.64
     I gotta think myself, shoulder abduction.
},
{
    422.64,424.6
     So that one's going out to the side.
},
{
    424.6,427.64
     If I'm lying down again, I'd be going out like this.
},
{
    427.64,428.92
     I can just do the shoulder this one.
},
{
    428.92,431.24
     You're gonna show out to the side.
},
{
    431.24,433.44
     You could do it actively too.
},
{
    433.44,436.7
     And this one I hit the ear.
},
{
    436.7,438.0
     This one's a little bit tight.
},
{
    438.0,438.84
     Do you see that?
},
{
    438.84,441.76
     I mean, I've got tight shoulders.
},
{
    441.76,443.24
     This is as high as I can.
},
{
    443.24,445.24
     I can't come close to my ears.
},
{
    445.24,448.6
     Yeah, and that might have been for years for you too.
},
{
    448.6,450.04
     Yeah, historically it's a kind of,
},
{
    450.04,451.32
     I think a genetic thing.
},
{
    451.32,452.28
     Sure.
},
{
    452.28,456.6
     The last one, we measured shoulder external rotation.
},
{
    456.6,458.96
     Now we're gonna measure shoulder internal rotation.
},
{
    458.96,461.0
     Yep, you're gonna measure just like that.
},
{
    461.0,463.76
     Again, I've got pretty decent motion.
},
{
    463.76,466.2
     You can do this lying down too, same thing.
},
{
    467.96,469.4
     Minor.
},
{
    469.4,471.22
     Whatever yours are, they're equal.
},
{
    471.22,472.06
     You know what I mean?
},
{
    472.06,476.04
     They're equal external rotation.
},
{
    476.04,478.02
     How is abduction on you?
},
{
    479.16,480.56
     Oh yeah, you're tighter on that one.
},
{
    480.56,482.4
     Right side, yeah.
},
{
    482.4,484.36
     I'm right-handed.
},
{
    484.36,485.72
     I'd have injured both shoulders.
},
{
    485.72,487.48
     Maybe that one twice, I don't know.
},
{
    487.48,488.6
     I can't remember though, that stuff.
},
{
    488.6,489.92
     All right, so that's the shoulder.
},
{
    489.92,493.76
     Now with the knee, Brad was gonna show this one.
},
{
    493.76,496.2
     The first thing that you tend to lose
},
{
    496.2,498.64
     is it just doesn't straighten as far.
},
{
    498.64,499.88
     You lose the extension.
},
{
    499.88,502.28
     So you can sit on the edge of the chair.
},
{
    502.28,503.72
     If you look at the stripes,
},
{
    503.72,505.16
     we're going to see if it's straight.
},
{
    505.16,507.88
     And the good thing to do is just compare one to the other.
},
{
    507.88,509.96
     If one doesn't go down as far,
},
{
    509.96,511.6
     you can also put your foot up.
},
{
    511.6,514.36
     Put this one up a little bit so that you can see the difference.
},
{
    514.36,515.8
     Yeah, let's say you check it.
},
{
    515.8,518.92
     Yeah, and you can see that one just doesn't go as straight.
},
{
    518.92,519.76
     Right.
},
{
    519.76,521.04
     And that's...
},
{
    521.04,522.28
     You can do it.
},
{
    522.28,524.12
     It's nice to have a rolling stool.
},
{
    524.12,526.04
     You could do it on a stationary one.
},
{
    526.04,527.52
     And check them this way too.
},
{
    527.52,528.52
     You may have to lean back
},
{
    528.52,530.48
     because your hamstrings may be tight.
},
{
    530.48,531.98
     If the hamstrings are tight,
},
{
    531.98,533.56
     you feel these muscles pulling really hard.
},
{
    533.56,536.12
     You'll have to do it on the floor, on the edge.
},
{
    536.12,537.28
     But it's the same thing.
},
{
    537.28,541.14
     You're looking for, see if they're both equal and straight.
},
{
    542.04,544.92
     And then you're gonna test, that's the first sign.
},
{
    544.92,546.32
     That's the first thing that tends to go,
},
{
    546.32,549.24
     but you might have lost flexion on the knee too.
},
{
    549.24,550.64
     And so,
},
{
    550.64,551.96
     you can check that way.
},
{
    551.96,553.28
     So this thing,
},
{
    553.28,554.92
     this one you could do on the chair,
},
{
    554.92,557.68
     you can check one,
},
{
    557.68,559.32
     and then obviously check the other
},
{
    559.32,561.12
     and compare.
},
{
    561.12,563.24
     Common thing with these is that grinding,
},
{
    563.24,567.02
     crepitus sound that's probably more common than the shoulder
},
{
    567.02,568.26
     and probably the hip too.
},
{
    568.26,570.94
     You can test this one lying down too.
},
{
    570.94,572.06
     Check the knee.
},
{
    572.06,573.76
     And again, you'll, you know,
},
{
    573.76,575.56
     sometimes they look very close,
},
{
    575.56,577.4
     but the one feels just feels tighter.
},
{
    577.4,579.02
     It doesn't feel like it's going as well.
},
{
    579.02,581.82
     Do that again, Bob, because just note on this one,
},
{
    581.82,584.78
     we're not paying attention to the knee position.
},
{
    584.78,588.16
     We're paying attention to the heel going towards the buttock,
},
{
    588.16,590.96
     that distance right there, right to left.
},
{
    590.96,593.24
     Yeah, that's a good indicator Brad, very good.
},
{
    593.24,595.0
     That's good that you pointed that out.
},
{
    595.0,599.48
     So, what happens if you have found
},
{
    599.48,600.76
     that you do have arthritis?
},
{
    600.76,603.48
     You do wanna try to regain that motion.
},
{
    603.48,606.16
     If you lost some internal rotation, you wanna try to regain that motion. If you lost some internal rotation,
},
{
    606.16,607.6
     you wanna try to regain it.
},
{
    607.6,609.72
     We have videos on that.
},
{
    609.72,612.28
     So if you look up, Bob and Brad,
},
{
    612.28,616.2
     and you do shoulder arthritis, hip arthritis,
},
{
    616.2,618.12
     knee arthritis, it'll pop up.
},
{
    618.12,620.44
     And it'll show you stretches that you can do.
},
{
    620.44,623.8
     Yeah, you may wanna put shoulder arthritis,
},
{
    623.8,625.64
     exercises, a arrange your motion.
},
{
    625.64,628.64
     So you can narrow down a little quicker
},
{
    628.64,630.4
     or just go to the YouTube channel
},
{
    630.4,632.0
     and go right to our site.
},
{
    632.0,633.36
     Yep, all right.
},
{
    633.36,635.36
     Remember Brad and I can fix this about anything?
},
{
    635.36,636.84
     Except for...
},
{
    636.84,637.68
     I'm broken heart.
},
{
    637.68,639.32
     That's right, Bob.
},
{
    639.32,640.32
     What do you seem sad about?
},
{
    640.32,642.68
     Well, we've been working on it for a long time, Bob.
},
{
    642.68,646.32
     And we're not getting a lot, not attraction yet.
},
{
    646.32,647.84
     Well, we can fix just about anything.
},
{
    647.84,648.92
     Yeah. Except that.
},
{
    648.92,650.08
     That makes me feel better.
},
{
    650.08,None
     All right, thanks. you
},
