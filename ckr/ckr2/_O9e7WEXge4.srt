     Welcome back guys, I'm Nick from Active Chiropractic and today I want to show you how to increase
},
{
    8.8,12.48
     your cervical odosis, which is basically a normal curve that helps you support your
},
{
    12.48,14.0
     really heavy head.
},
{
    14.0,18.12
     As years go by and you lose this cervical curve, what happens is your vertebrae gets
},
{
    18.12,21.2
     closer and closer together and even rub against each other.
},
{
    21.2,24.72
     If they rub against each other, therefore it becomes arthritis, but they even might
},
{
    24.72,27.96
     fuse and therefore the nerves in your spine won't have any room
},
{
    27.96,31.8
     to move and you'll get a lot of tingling and pain down the arm. And you don't want
},
{
    31.8,35.48
     that. It may be even weakness and you won't even be able to use your arms.
},
{
    35.48,39.84
     So maintaining this cervical curve is vital for your health. Not only that, but it also
},
{
    39.84,43.2
     stops the compensation of your back and your lower back as well.
},
{
    43.2,46.36
     To do these exercises, you will need a hand towel or a gym towel.
},
{
    46.36,49.04
     Place the towel behind your neck and pull it forward slightly.
},
{
    49.04,52.64
     Whilst doing this extend your head back and forward like a nodding action.
},
{
    52.64,55.6
     Do about 20 to 30 reps of this, 3 sets.
},
{
    55.6,59.4
     Now whilst doing this with your chest up and your shoulder blades retracted extend your
},
{
    59.4,62.68
     head back and then move your head forward like a nodding action.
},
{
    62.68,64.6
     Do about 20 to 30 reps of this.
},
{
    64.6,69.28
     This creates a lot of movement in the cervical spine. Once you feel comfortable and there's no pain when
},
{
    69.28,73.44
     you do these exercises anymore, what you can do is basically use a resistant band and that will
},
{
    73.44,77.68
     definitely accentuate the cervical odosis a lot better. Make sure you get a resistant band that's
},
{
    77.68,81.52
     about 20 to 30 pounds of resistance and you can get these at any sporting goods store.
},
{
    82.88,86.24
     So to add traction all you need to do is put the resistor band behind your neck and
},
{
    86.24,88.52
     add a little bit of resistance and pulling it forward.
},
{
    88.52,91.34
     This way there's a bit of force that pushes it from the back of your neck to the front
},
{
    91.34,92.34
     of the neck.
},
{
    92.34,96.1
     Once this is easy and not painful for you, go from side to side and then once that's
},
{
    96.1,97.88
     easy go diagonally.
},
{
    97.88,102.14
     About 20 to 30 reps, 3 sets once again.
},
{
    102.14,106.0
     After while using the resistor band against your neck, it might hurt because the resistor
},
{
    106.0,109.6
     band might be cutting into your neck, so what you can do is cover your neck with a towel
},
{
    109.6,111.92
     first and then add a bit of comfort for yourself.
},
{
    111.92,116.44
     As you can see by doing the extension of the neck with these exercises, it accentuates the
},
{
    116.44,120.04
     cervical lordosis again and creates a healthy curve again.
},
{
    120.04,124.48
     Just like the previous exercise, just extend your head back and forth about 20 to 30 times,
},
{
    124.48,129.24
     then maybe going side by side 20 to 30 times, and maybe going diagonal as well.
},
{
    129.24,134.36
     Just remember that the main purpose of these exercises is to accentuate the cervical lo-dosis,
},
{
    134.36,138.12
     reduce stiffness, increase range of motion, and creating a better posture for you and
},
{
    138.12,142.68
     making you look younger and healthier, therefore reducing the pain and also increasing quality
},
{
    142.68,143.68
     of life.
},
{
    143.68,145.2
