     So here's one for the sciatica suffers. In this video I'm going to reveal not one but two secret
},
{
    4.96,10.8
     sciatica stretches that can give instant pain relief. I've seen a lot of sciatica suffers over
},
{
    10.8,15.12
     the years and I can tell you these are two of my favorite stretches to be able to do because you
},
{
    15.12,21.28
     can do them at home. They're quick, easy, and just give a lot of relief. So don't miss out. Stay tuned.
},
{
    21.28,27.8
     So the first one we're going to do is called a sciatic slump stretch and it's done in a chair. What you're going to do is sit at the edge of
},
{
    27.8,32.84
     the chair and then take the affected side, that leg, and then go all the way
},
{
    32.84,36.24
     straight with it. You're going to really feel a pull in the back of the leg, the
},
{
    36.24,40.52
     calf, possibly all the way into the foot. What we're going to do for the first part
},
{
    40.52,44.92
     is bring the toes back towards us. The more that you bring them back towards you,
},
{
    44.92,49.24
     the more it's going to intensify that whole sciatic pathway. What we're trying
},
{
    49.24,55.52
     to do is release tension. So I like to hold this one for about 10 to 15 seconds. I then
},
{
    55.52,60.24
     relax and you can bring your leg down too if you need to. I mean take a breather if
},
{
    60.24,64.24
     you need it and you're just going to keep repeating that. I like to do it upwards to
},
{
    64.24,69.36
     five times. So for the second part of this stretch, we're going to go back into that same position with
},
{
    69.36,74.08
     the toes back towards us, but now we're going to use our upper body weight to lean into it. So
},
{
    74.08,80.08
     just kind of take the chin, lean forward, and that is really going to intensify that stretch.
},
{
    80.08,86.2
     Only go to your comfort level. If you feel a lightening bull going down your leg back off a little bit
},
{
    86.2,92.72
     Let pain be your guide go to where you feel comfortable. So again, this is the stretch bring the leg up
},
{
    92.84,96.84
     We're going to bring that toes back towards us. We're going to hold that for 15 seconds
},
{
    97.48,101.78
     Relax repeat it three to five times and then for the second part
},
{
    101.78,103.78
     We're going to bring the leg back up and
},
{
    104.32,107.24
     Then lean into it to intensify that stretch
},
{
    107.24,112.84
     It just takes a lot of tension off that sciatic nerve pathway. Give it a try
},
{
    112.84,117.92
     So here's the second stretch that's going to take a lot of tension off that sciatic nerve
},
{
    118.0,120.26
     So far if you've been having a lot of relief
},
{
    120.4,127.8
     Especially with that first one we did type in sciatica sucks in the comments section below to know that it's working for you. Also, if you're

},
{

     appreciate it. Alright, on with the show. So what we're going to do is we're going
},
{
    136.64,140.04
     to put our hands behind our heads right here and we're going to just lean into
},
{
    140.04,144.8
     it. The more that you lean into it, the more tension is going to be relieved off
},
{
    144.8,145.36
     the back. So you're going to feel it here, more tension is going to be relieved off the back.
},
{
    145.36,150.08
     So you're going to feel it here, but back of the legs. So I'll show you what I mean.
},
{
    158.56,162.72
     So what I like to do with this one is hold for about 15 seconds,
},
{
    162.72,166.72
     30 if you're able to. Relax, do it about three to five times.
},
{
    166.72,169.24
     Only go to where you feel comfortable.
},
{
    169.24,170.52
     Do not overdo it.
},
{
    170.52,172.12
     So I hope this video helped you out

{
