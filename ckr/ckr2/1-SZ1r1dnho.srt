     Hi, I'm Dr. Adam Fields.
},
{
    2.16,4.2
     Let's do some exercises and help your
},
{
    4.2,5.92
     use station tube dysfunction. We're going
},
{
    5.92,7.56
     to start with some massage techniques.
},
{
    7.56,9.48
     Follow along, let's do it. We're going to
},
{
    9.48,11.76
     start in between your eyebrows. You're
},
{
    11.76,13.84
     going to just do some circular motions.
},
{
    13.84,16.56
     If you want, you can do vertical, also
},
{
    16.56,19.12
     horizontal. Let's just start moving this.
},
{
    19.12,22.48
     Let your face relax, let your shoulders
},
{
    22.48,24.96
     relax. I think it's really doing a lot of
},
{
    24.96,30.48
     work as your hand. Just working between. We find a lot of people this helps the jaw relax.
},
{
    30.76,32.76
     The forehead obviously relax.
},
{
    33.6,35.6
     The cheeks, the face.
},
{
    36.56,45.1
     Let's increase some fluid flow dynamics in and around your face and hopefully get those eustachian tubes draining.
},
{
    45.86,50.56
     Speaking of draining this next move, I did just grab your earlobes.
},
{
    50.56,57.18
     Actually not just the tip of your earlobes, but grab a little bit more your whole lower ear and start doing some circular motions.
},
{
    57.48,60.12
     This move I was researching and
},
{
    60.92,69.0
     I found this move and I didn't have any mucus going on in my body, but all of a sudden I did it for about a minute
},
{
    69.0,73.0
     and I felt like just a clump of mucus come down the back of my throat. It was wonderful.
},
{
    73.0,79.0
     And we love that mucus. So let's see if we get some mucus going with you.
},
{
    79.0,85.04
     These moves are really meant to go along with what I do in the office which is endo nasal
},
{
    85.04,90.32
     cranial adjusting and the Muncie technique and some class 4 lasers etc.
},
{
    90.96,96.48
     for e-station tube dysfunction. So just just go ahead and keep doing that circular motion. You
},
{
    96.48,101.2
     might find this is a little tender in here so go ahead and just work through that tenderness.
},
{
    101.2,105.66
     Work through it. If there's tenderness in there, it means you need it a little bit.
},
{
    105.66,109.96
     So just work it, pinch it, roll it,
},
{
    109.96,112.16
     roll it in your fingers.
},
{
    112.16,113.8
     There you go, good.
},
{
    115.52,117.86
     So this next one, we're gonna go to something
},
{
    117.86,120.0
     called the tragus.
},
{
    120.0,122.64
     The tragus is right here on your ear.
},
{
    122.64,124.52
     You're gonna pinch that tragus,
},
{
    124.52,128.48
     and let's just pinch it and just pull it a little bit out.
},
{
    128.48,130.24
     Just pull, pull, just pulse it.
},
{
    131.28,132.28
     Pulse it.
},
{
    132.28,137.28
     It's good for some tinnitus, some headaches.
},
{
    138.04,139.96
     A lot of people get some benefit there.
},
{
    139.96,142.12
     We're gonna go right in the front of the ear now,
},
{
    142.12,145.4
     right in the front and do some circular motions right in the front, and do some circular motions.
},
{
    145.4,148.44
     Circular motions, just like this.
},
{
    148.44,150.76
     And this one, you might feel some tenderness.
},
{
    150.76,151.76
     In fact, let's just push it.
},
{
    151.76,154.76
     If you feel tender, just push and hold.
},
{
    154.76,157.6
     Hold that, take a couple of deep breaths.
},
{
    157.6,158.44
     Just...
},
{
    162.68,169.56
     Let your body relax, let your face relax, and just feel that tenderness and hopefully
},
{
    169.56,170.56
     it'll melt.
},
{
    170.56,175.12
     You want to go at least good 40 seconds on this to a minute.
},
{
    175.12,179.96
     Sometimes people feel radiation that might feel the pain go into their jaw, up to their
},
{
    179.96,181.92
     temples.
},
{
    181.92,187.72
     Just keep breathing and pushing. If it dissipates a bit go back to the
},
{
    187.72,195.84
     circular motions. So we're gonna go next to a point two inches above your ears
},
{
    195.84,200.6
     and a little bit into here a little bit towards your face and we're gonna do
},
{
    200.6,207.24
     some circles here. This one actually there was a 2006 study that showed this could help tinnitus.
},
{
    207.24,209.52
     Amazing, ringing in the ears.
},
{
    209.52,213.0
     A lot of you with the Eustachian dysfunction have tinnitus.
},
{
    213.0,215.6
     You have sinus issues.
},
{
    215.6,218.6
     You have suboxypetal pain, etc.
},
{
    218.6,224.48
     So we're going to work these areas and get some drainage happening.
},
{
    224.48,225.48
     Good.
},
{
    225.48,231.44
     You know, also what I really like is something called oil pulling that you can do at home
},
{
    231.44,236.56
     where you take coconut oil or sesame oil and swish it around in your mouth for about 20
},
{
    236.56,237.56
     minutes.
},
{
    237.56,241.44
     You'll feel some mucus again come down the back of your throat.
},
{
    241.44,246.0
     Make sure you drink a lot of warm water, which will again help loosen mucus.
},
{
    246.0,249.0
     Go just work it.
},
{
    249.0,250.0
     Find those tender spots.
},
{
    250.0,254.0
     You might find that you have to go a quarter inch up or a quarter inch down or a quarter
},
{
    254.0,255.0
     inch back.
},
{
    255.0,256.64
     Just find that tender spot.
},
{
    256.64,257.64
     Get in there.
},
{
    257.64,260.0
     Use a couple of fingers on this one.
},
{
    260.0,262.0
     Nice.
},
{
    262.0,271.76
     Let your face relax as you do those circular motions.
},
{
    271.76,278.16
     So there's another spot that is sort of like a 45 degree piece of cartilage, a line of
},
{
    278.16,281.52
     cartilage on the inner part of your outer ear.
},
{
    281.52,283.16
     That's called the dath.
},
{
    283.16,286.78
     The dath is a place right here. We're going to get on
},
{
    286.78,292.42
     that dath right there and we're going to just do some circles. Now this area it's
},
{
    292.42,296.02
     very interesting because a lot of people find that their migraines do a little
},
{
    296.02,301.18
     bit better with these and some people have even pierced that part of their
},
{
    301.18,306.4
     ear to stimulate the acupuncture point to help the migrants.
},
{
    307.44,313.76
     Go figure. You're piercing might not just be a way to be fashionable. It could help your migrants.
},
{
    315.04,326.48
     Good. And really stretch that ear out. Stretch it out. Feel the the ear kind of open up, move that cartilage around. Your ears need a good dose of movement
},
{
    326.48,331.48
     and flow and dynamic change here.
},
{
    332.36,333.72
     There you go, just circle it.
},
{
    333.72,335.16
     Let's go the other direction.
},
{
    336.2,337.04
     Very good.
},
{
    338.2,339.8
     Maybe get a little speed on it.
},
{
    340.84,341.68
     Nice.
},
{
    344.08,351.6
     Think about what you're happy about. What makes you happiest? We want muscles to relax
},
{
    351.6,356.16
     and muscles tense up when we think about stressful things. So just go to the happy. What are
},
{
    356.16,367.28
     you grateful for? What are you excited about? Let's be thankful for what we have and then what we don't have is more likely to come
},
{
    367.28,368.28
     about.
},
{
    368.28,369.28
     Okay, let's relax.
},
{
    369.28,373.24
     Oh, my ears feel really good after that.
},
{
    373.24,391.2
     So let's jet the jaw out and we're going to wiggle it back and forth like this. Sometimes you'll feel the ears open up a little bit while you're doing it.
},
{
    391.2,397.2
     You feel a little crackling in there.
},
{
    397.2,416.2
     Good. Be happy you're not the one making yourself look silly on YouTube.
},
{
    416.2,419.24
     Now we're going to do occipital lifts.
},
{
    419.24,425.52
     This part of your neck is really connected to your jaw and connected to your sinuses. So we're
},
{
    425.52,428.88
     going to take this part of the base of your thumb, I do this in a lot of my
},
{
    428.88,433.84
     videos, base your thumb to your mastoid process right here behind your ear and
},
{
    433.84,438.6
     we're going to lift. Okay we're going to lift one side as we pull down on the
},
{
    438.6,446.64
     other. Lift and pull, lift and pull, there we go, really get some,
},
{
    446.64,449.9
     get a shearing force in here and just lift.
},
{
    449.9,452.4
     You might find one area is a little bit more blocked
},
{
    452.4,454.6
     than another or a little tender.
},
{
    454.6,456.08
     Just push on that area.
},
{
    456.08,459.34
     You might want to change the angle a bit.
},
{
    459.34,462.96
     Push, push, push.
},
{
    462.96,467.0
     That's it.
},
{
    472.36,475.4
     Keep going. I have people come in my office,
},
{
    475.4,478.28
     they have headaches, I say,
},
{
    478.28,482.6
     give me 50 occipital lifts, and boom,
},
{
    482.6,489.2
     gone. It can be quite a miracle worker keep going lift lift give me 10 more
},
{
    497.48,499.48
     Good
},
{
    499.64,502.48
     Nice feel that lightness that that gives you in your head
},
{
    503.12,507.12
     Now we're gonna pull the ears. we're gonna yawn, okay?
},
{
    507.12,510.36
     So pull, yawn.
},
{
    512.52,514.12
     You really feel the ears popping.
},
{
    515.92,516.76
     Like that.
},
{
    518.12,519.18
     Pull and yawn.
},
{
    524.92,531.92
     He might even yawn.
},
{
    531.92,534.8
     Pull and yawn.
},
{
    534.8,542.12
     Open those ears.
},
{
    542.12,547.72
     Now we're going to pull and just move that mouth around.
},
{
    547.72,552.72
     Save the vowels.
},
{
    552.72,563.36
     Alright, the last one, grab a sip of water and you're going to pinch your nose.
},
{
    563.36,567.0
     Now, a lot of people find they're breathing closed,
},
{
    567.0,568.96
     their ears are closed down right away with this
},
{
    568.96,570.52
     and then they'll open back up.
},
{
    570.52,574.44
     So we're going to stop when we feel them open back up.
},
{
    574.44,575.94
     So go ahead and pinch your nose.
},
{
    589.76,596.3
     And then breathe a little bit. If you have to do a little val salva where you breathe in and you push into your nose
},
{
    596.3,599.72
     with your nose being closed and then yawn.
},
{
    599.72,600.72
     Good.
},
{
    600.72,607.92
     And swallow and your ears hopefully are opened up. We're here for you. Cheers to your ears
},
