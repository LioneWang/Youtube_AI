     Bob and Brad, the two most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    7.96,11.5
     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist, Brad Heineck physical therapist
},
{
    11.5,13.8
     Together we are the most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    13.8,14.96
     In our opinion of course Bob
},
{
    14.96,19.92
     They're gonna be glad to came to watch today Brad because we're gonna talk about 10 surprising things to avoid
},
{
    20.32,23.0
     When you have a herniated disc or sciatica
},
{
    24.16,25.32
     Exactly, are you shocked that
},
{
    25.32,29.64
     we're going to discuss this? Ten of them. Yeah, that's amazing. Alright, first thing
},
{
    29.64,33.92
     you want to do Brad, is you want to avoid prolonged sitting. People don't
},
{
    33.92,37.84
     realize that this injury or this type of problem is often a sitting problem
},
{
    37.84,42.76
     rather than a lifting problem. The more that your back is in this somewhat
},
{
    42.76,46.7
     rounded out position C posture, which Brad's going to demonstrate right now
},
{
    47.56,51.22
     That's putting stresses on the disc which is pushing it out towards the back
},
{
    51.22,53.44
     We've showed this many times on some of our other videos
},
{
    53.88,59.42
     So you really want to avoid sitting when I hurt my back the one time Brad where I threw out my disc I
},
{
    60.12,65.32
     Actually, I actually did not sit. I would either stand or lay down.
},
{
    65.32,66.72
     I mean, just to show you how.
},
{
    66.72,67.56
     Right.
},
{
    67.56,68.44
     I know when I bothered mind,
},
{
    68.44,72.48
     I took a table that I could raise up to do my notes on.
},
{
    72.48,73.72
     That's what I did.
},
{
    73.72,74.56
     Yep.
},
{
    74.56,76.82
     Yeah, one of the tables I go into the bed,
},
{
    76.82,78.6
     I lifted it up, the tray table.
},
{
    78.6,79.44
     No kidding?
},
{
    79.44,80.64
     Yeah, it worked well for my notes.
},
{
    80.64,82.96
     I know I was doing an internship at the time
},
{
    82.96,87.0
     and I would do my notes standing on a counter.
},
{
    87.0,91.0
     Alright that again shows you how, especially long card writes.
},
{
    91.0,94.0
     As a matter of fact a friend of mine's life is having back problems.
},
{
    94.0,100.0
     She cannot sit and do her computer work and he's asking me can I get her one of the elevating computer desk
},
{
    100.0,103.0
     so she can stand while she's working at the computer.
},
{
    103.0,104.0
     So she's doing it.
},
{
    104.0,106.24
     That's a good idea. Alright. Yep. All right number two
},
{
    106.24,111.72
     A lot of people think okay, I've got back pain. I'm gonna do yoga. Right. That's gonna help me
},
{
    111.72,117.76
     Mm-hmm, and there's just so many of the stretches in yoga that you can't do. I mean it's gonna right
},
{
    117.76,122.36
     I think some some may be fine some are actually probably great for you
},
{
    122.48,126.12
     But I you know it would take us a long time to go through which ones are bad
},
{
    126.12,128.64
     But obviously any ones that you're going like this
},
{
    129.76,133.6
     So I see pictures of people doing yoga and they're in this position
},
{
    134.04,137.36
     That's probably going to make that disc herniate more
},
{
    137.36,142.04
     Right, or you know they do this one where they're down like this
},
{
    142.56,147.12
     You know, all that could be could be really bad for your back.
},
{
    147.12,149.6
     So avoid yoga, sorry yoga people, but.
},
{
    149.6,153.68
     Right, unless you're gonna weed out the ones you should do
},
{
    153.68,155.28
     and the ones you shouldn't do,
},
{
    155.28,157.04
     but we don't have time for that right now.
},
{
    157.04,158.52
     If you have to sit,
},
{
    158.52,160.84
     we wanna make sure you're sitting with support.
},
{
    160.84,163.84
     So you're gonna wanna have some type of lumbar support.
},
{
    163.84,165.16
     If you don't have one
},
{
    165.16,170.64
     All you have to do is roll up a towel and Brad's got his famous little duct tape on
},
{
    170.64,175.4
     there or a minor little duct tape I don't know what that is and help hold it in place
},
{
    175.4,182.28
     So I think both of us say sit on a firm upright chair avoid the soft cushy
},
{
    182.28,191.52
     furniture that's going to promote that poor posture. Yeah, a soft couch or a soft chair is going to kill you. Exactly. So here we got that firm chair
},
{
    191.52,196.24
     and I'm going to sit here and you'll find you'll put that lumbar support right about at the belt
},
{
    196.24,201.6
     line, you'll know because it's going to feel good if you may have to adjust it per individual
},
{
    201.6,208.64
     and right there. Now right now I can tell that this is a little bit too big It's pushing my back out too far. You'd probably want more of a thinner one like this
},
{
    209.28,210.84
     and
},
{
    210.84,214.34
     Actually in my car. All right, that's better. I
},
{
    215.84,219.38
     Have one of these and I have another one that two of these are taped together
},
{
    219.48,224.1
     And it depends on the day sometimes I'll use the one sometimes we'll put one with two in there
},
{
    224.28,225.8
     Sometimes I don't use it at all,
},
{
    225.8,228.8
     but I've been working with my back for a long time,
},
{
    228.8,229.92
     I kind of have it tuned in.
},
{
    229.92,231.8
     You kind of know what, what is what.
},
{
    231.8,233.8
     You know, what I have found, Brad,
},
{
    233.8,236.36
     with a lot of people is that when they're having
},
{
    236.36,237.8
     problems with a herniated disc,
},
{
    237.8,240.68
     a lot of times they want more towel than less.
},
{
    240.68,241.76
     When they're doing preventative,
},
{
    241.76,243.36
     then they want less towel.
},
{
    243.36,245.24
     But so that's the thing, you can take a towel
},
{
    245.24,247.28
     and you can roll it up as big as you want
},
{
    247.28,249.32
     and try it and see what helps.
},
{
    249.32,251.08
     It maybe have two sizes in your car.
},
{
    251.08,251.92
     Exactly.
},
{
    251.92,253.92
     Now if you're on a couch, you have to sit on a couch,
},
{
    253.92,255.72
     take a throw pillow or something behind you
},
{
    255.72,257.28
     and put it behind you.
},
{
    257.28,258.12
     Yeah.
},
{
    258.12,259.08
     One of those recliners or whatever,
},
{
    259.08,262.4
     make sure you got, like I said, a throw pillow
},
{
    262.4,264.32
     because you're really gonna sink in otherwise.
},
{
    264.32,268.32
     All right, so. All right Brad, by the way, a lot of people are new to our channel.
},
{
    268.32,269.32
     They may be.
},
{
    269.32,270.32
     Hi, welcome.
},
{
    270.32,274.32
     If you are the first time, we want to make sure that you take a minute just to subscribe,
},
{
    274.32,276.08
     please, please.
},
{
    276.08,281.76
     Because we upload a video every day and they're all here designed to help you stay fit, healthy
},
{
    281.76,282.76
     and pain-free.
},
{
    282.76,289.8
     Yep, simple little tricks like this can go a long way. All right number five, number four Brad is really avoid bending and
},
{
    289.8,295.68
     twisting. If you want to hurt your back, if you want to, this is what you do, you
},
{
    295.68,300.04
     bend and you twist. Sure. And when do you do that Brad? A lot of times when you're
},
{
    300.04,304.44
     shoveling, you shovel like this, now I'm bent and then I throw it over here, I'm
},
{
    304.44,305.44
     twisting.
},
{
    305.44,312.0
     And then add on some heavy wet snow into that. Right and you've got it now, now you're gonna hurt.
},
{
    312.0,320.4
     So number five Brad, sit-ups, full sit-ups. This is gonna put your back in that position again.
},
{
    320.4,328.64
     And you know I thought people all knew about this but I still see I see instructors on the internet yet that are even doing this sometimes so they're
},
{
    328.64,332.84
     doing the full sit-up this is terribly hard on your back it's a lot of stress
},
{
    332.84,336.72
     on that low back and then to make it worse they'll do a sit-up with a twist so
},
{
    336.72,340.12
     now we're doing like a bend my back just hurt right there doing that you know
},
{
    340.12,346.36
     either way no no but yeah there's a lot of options to do sit-ups. I mean that does work the stomach
},
{
    346.36,352.38
     Well, so it does, believe me, but it really puts a high amount of stress on the back and so does things like this
},
{
    352.78,354.78
     Working this way. Yep. So
},
{
    355.24,360.16
     Matter of fact, they're gonna do a video later on some of that, but we've got other ones too. Okay. Go on here
},
{
    360.34,362.34
     number six, this is just kind of a
},
{
    363.52,366.44
     Obscure one, but if you are riding on a lawnmower,
},
{
    366.44,371.92
     a lot of people are in kind of a bad posture when they're in it and it's shock absorber.
},
{
    371.92,375.28
     And so you're putting a lot of stress on the disc while you're doing that.
},
{
    375.28,380.76
     I'm not a big fan of back belts, but if you're out riding and riding lawnmower,
},
{
    380.76,383.48
     you got a bumpy lawn, I think that would be a good idea.
},
{
    383.48,384.96
     That would be a good idea.
},
{
    384.96,387.8
     You know, it's going toch you in and kick you up.
},
{
    387.8,393.36
     If you need to have to do it you're actually probably better off doing a push more maybe.
},
{
    393.36,395.36
     Two acres of lawn.
},
{
    395.36,398.2
     We get a lot of questions Brad about yeah.
},
{
    398.2,402.24
     We get a lot of questions too about whether or not can I weight lift.
},
{
    402.24,404.6
     When you have a herniated disc I just don't think you can do it.
},
{
    404.6,407.92
     I mean you can do some you could maybe do bench press.
},
{
    407.92,408.76
     Sure, yep.
},
{
    408.76,412.46
     You can maybe do curls, but you certainly can't do,
},
{
    412.46,414.0
     you can't do squats.
},
{
    414.0,415.2
     I mean, if you're doing a squat
},
{
    415.2,417.08
     and you're bending down like this,
},
{
    417.08,418.72
     I don't even, if you keep your back straight,
},
{
    418.72,420.16
     you're putting a lot of stress on it.
},
{
    420.16,421.28
     It's not worth it.
},
{
    421.28,423.08
     Definitely not dead lifts.
},
{
    423.08,424.04
     And definitely not,
},
{
    424.04,425.84
     I don't know, why don't you ever do in bent over rows?
},
{
    425.84,427.84
     I know I see people do that a lot.
},
{
    427.88,429.6
     So
},
{
    429.6,435.92
     The things we could talk about. The things we could discuss doesn't it go on and on Brad? Okay sleeping
},
{
    438.0,442.44
     One thing you want to avoid with sleeping is I don't want you sleeping in a flexed posture all night Brad
},
{
    442.44,450.24
     So I don't want you laying on your side. Where's my mic over here? And laying like this all night long. You know it's just again putting
},
{
    450.24,454.08
     your back in that flex. Now there's not a lot of stress on your back in this position,
},
{
    454.8,458.88
     but it's just not, it's better to be a bit straighter. If you're one of those
},
{
    458.88,465.96
     little strong broad men that have wide shoulders, I mean that can put your back at an angle this way as well.
},
{
    465.96,469.76
     Right and that's why we recommend quite often is you could take a sheet.
},
{
    469.76,475.48
     We also have something pre-made here but you put the sheet in a roll.
},
{
    475.48,483.36
     You're going to spin it around like that. This is kind of crude right now Brad.
},
{
    483.36,485.76
     Some people actually tie a sheet around them
},
{
    485.76,489.8
     And then when they lay on their side, they got some support here
},
{
    489.8,492.52
     So they're not sagging here and when they lay on their back
},
{
    492.52,496.72
     They got some support and keep the arch there. It's that hollow spot
},
{
    496.72,500.92
     That's created by the pelvis right here. The back is going to zip down right there
},
{
    500.92,507.52
     Well, you got to fill it in so that'll straighten and neutralize that spine. Good demonstration Brad. Now there's premade products too.
},
{
    507.52,513.22
     You want to show that one Brad? That's the Mackenzie, right? Yep, this is the Mackenzie sleep roll they call it.
},
{
    513.22,518.1
     The Mackenzie sleep roll you put it around here. This is this would be for a smaller person than me.
},
{
    518.42,525.22
     But you tie it here and if it was if I had the right size it would come like that here and then
},
{
    525.22,529.6
     protect the back as well as support the back I should say. Let's show one little
},
{
    529.6,533.6
     trick to Brad for sleeping with you. I thought you're going to do a magic trick.
},
{
    533.6,539.0
     You're killing me Bob. I'm going to make Brad disappear. Okay actually I'm going to make you disappear.
},
{
    539.0,544.64
     So what you're going to do is you're going to lay on your good side. Okay so
},
{
    544.64,545.88
     let's say my pain's going down my leg here. I'm going to lay on your good side, okay? So let's say my pain is going down
},
{
    545.88,549.88
     my leg here, I'm going to lay on my good side which is this side, I'm going to lay on my
},
{
    549.88,556.76
     right side and then put the two pillows, okay, one pillow or two pillows
},
{
    556.76,560.76
     underneath you like this with the leg bent and believe it or not sometimes
},
{
    560.76,564.0
     that helps arch the back up a little bit on this side and it helps relieve the
},
{
    564.0,565.4
     stress of the pain down the leg
},
{
    565.4,569.3
     But he would have pillows up. Yeah, I'd be have pillows here too. Yeah
},
{
    569.3,573.88
     I actually had a patient last year that I did this to her and she just was happy
},
{
    573.88,578.54
     It's like oh that feels so much better. A lot of people have trouble finding a correct position to sleep in a night
},
{
    578.54,580.54
     I know a lot of people
},
{
    580.54,583.46
     tend to sleep in a recliner when they have back pain. I
},
{
    584.12,585.04
     Don't know why it
},
{
    585.04,589.16
     helps, it does, I'd rather that you don't because you're sitting in that flex
},
{
    589.16,593.48
     position. It may be someone has stenosis and they think it's a disc, you know,
},
{
    593.48,598.48
     that may be one of those problems. Then it would help, yeah exactly. Okay, avoid prolonged
},
{
    598.48,602.72
     bending. You really don't want to be doing any task where you're like this in
},
{
    602.72,607.68
     this position here. And actually slight bending like brushing your teeth.
},
{
    607.68,612.0
     That'll set a lot of people's back pain off so make sure you're up tall.
},
{
    612.0,616.0
     Luckily a lot of people know this already because they get punished when they do it.
},
{
    616.0,619.04
     But if you're one thing that you know as a hint if you have to bend over
},
{
    619.84,622.64
     grab something to support it because it'll take the stress off your back.
},
{
    623.28,626.2
     I even say like for people who don't have back pain
},
{
    626.2,627.72
     and are gonna do some bending,
},
{
    627.72,630.6
     just to put your elbows on your knees like this,
},
{
    630.6,633.48
     and in case, take some of the stress off your...

     Obviously if you got the flexibility and you're strong enough,
},
{
    636.08,639.16
     if you can get down in your knees and maintain that.
},
{
    639.16,640.58
     But there's a lot of people with knee pain,
},
{
    640.58,641.76
     that's not an option.
},
{
    641.76,642.6
     You know, they're not able to get like that.
},
{
    642.6,643.44
     That makes it difficult.

    643.44,649.38
     So, all right, the last thing we're gonna mention, Brad Brad is vacuuming. Vacuuming especially the wrong way is very
},
{
    649.38,652.26
     hard in your back because this is what a lot of people do. This is my vacuum Brad.
},
{
    652.26,656.72
     I guess that's a nice vacuum. So they do this they bend and they move they don't
},
{
    656.72,659.56
     move their legs at all they're just bending and twisting at the whole time.
},
{
    659.56,662.86
     You got to reach under to get under that chair. So instead of what you should be doing you should be
},
{
    662.86,667.76
     dancing with it. You're dancing with the vacuum, every time the vacuum moves your leg moves.
},
{
    668.56,674.4
     And you actually walk with it too, don't you? Yeah, there you go. You can do the waltz as you
},
{
    674.4,679.52
     vacuum. Better yet you get one of those little room buzz or whatever those little circular
},
{
    679.52,683.36
     backs that go up. Yeah like a little robot. Yeah a little robot, yeah they don't have to bend at
},
{
    683.36,685.28
     all then. Alright, that's number 10, thanks for robot yeah they don't have to bend at all then. Alright
},
{
    685.28,689.18
     that's number 10 thanks for watching we don't have to have them suffer anymore
},
{
    689.18,693.44
     listening to us. It's over.
