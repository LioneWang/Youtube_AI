     Hello, Leon here from backintelligence.com where we help people manage their back pain from home
},
{
    5.6,9.76
     as well as help them fix their posture for the long term.
},
{
    9.76,15.76
     So today's video is going to be all about fixing your rounded shoulders posture.
},
{
    15.76,21.04
     This is a prevailing problem in today's society because so many of us sit in this hunched position
},
{
    21.04,30.22
     in front of our computers working all day and we get into this hunchback posture or refer to us around the shoulders posture as well and
},
{
    30.22,34.46
     usually the head moves forward with it that's why if people get so much neck
},
{
    34.46,38.86
     pain and all that kind of stuff that's forward head posture we've done a video
},
{
    38.86,42.3
     on that as well I'll have a link to it somewhere here or there's gonna be a
},
{
    42.3,48.28
     link in the description where Dr. Oliver talked about forward head posture specifically but in
},
{
    48.28,52.76
     today's video I'm gonna be talking more specifically about rounded shoulder
},
{
    52.76,57.92
     postures and some of the exercises that you can start doing in order to fix it.
},
{
    57.92,62.04
     I've noticed some people just tell you hey all you got to do is this one magic
},
{
    62.04,66.12
     exercise and that's gonna fix your shoulders, but that's not the case
},
{
    66.12,71.18
     Having a rounded shoulders posture means that there are certain muscles that need to be released and stretched
},
{
    71.46,79.08
     Like the levator scapula the chest muscles like the pec major and pec minor as well as upper traps and others
},
{
    79.08,84.4
     And on the other side you need to strengthen and activate other muscles like
},
{
    86.16,90.52
     side you need to strengthen and activate other muscles like lower traps as well as the external rotators as well as the serratus anterior muscle right so you
},
{
    90.52,95.12
     need to address all of these muscles effectively together in order for you to
},
{
    95.12,101.16
     see long-term effects and really get you out of that hunchback posture. So right
},
{
    101.16,104.76
     now I'm gonna show you five exercises that I recommend you start doing right
},
{
    104.76,108.44
     away to start fixing this posture. I recommend you do
},
{
    108.44,112.4
     them in order because they are set up in such a way that you start to release and
},
{
    112.4,116.8
     stretch the muscles and then eventually activate the correct muscles. And some of
},
{
    116.8,122.28
     these exercises come directly from Dr. Oliver's course on our website on how
},
{
    122.28,125.64
     to fix your round the shoulders at forward head posture as well,
},
{
    125.64,128.56
     neck, shoulder pain that you're experiencing.
},
{
    128.56,134.32
     So if you'd like the full program with a lot more exercises, you can get that on our website.
},
{
    134.32,138.84
     But right now I'm going to show you five exercises that you can start doing right away and if
},
{
    138.84,141.56
     you do them, you're going to start feeling relief already.
},
{
    141.56,148.0
     So the first thing you want to do is place it on your nose and now you're a clown. Okay now I'm just joking. Okay so we are gonna be using
},
{
    148.0,152.72
     a self massage ball. Okay there's massage balls, there's lacrosse balls, even a
},
{
    152.72,157.6
     tennis ball can work and we're gonna be doing a self massage for the chest
},
{
    157.6,163.48
     muscles which you have the pec major and then the pec minor underneath. Both of
},
{
    163.48,168.04
     these on both sides they get really, really tight on people with rounded
},
{
    168.04,169.52
     shoulders posture.
},
{
    169.52,174.32
     So I recommend you, before you even try to stretch them, you need to do what's called
},
{
    174.32,177.92
     a self-myofascial release on those muscles.
},
{
    177.92,180.32
     So what you're going to do is you're going to take the ball and then you're going to
},
{
    180.32,186.12
     place it where your chest area is, kind of right around this area, okay?
},
{
    186.12,188.92
     And you're going to find a spot that's tender.
},
{
    188.92,194.08
     So as you lean against the wall here, you're going to try to find a spot that's tender.
},
{
    194.08,196.72
     So you can roll around a little bit until you find it.
},
{
    196.72,203.08
     Once you find that spot, you're going to stop and just hold it for about 30 to 60 seconds,
},
{
    203.08,204.08
     okay?
},
{
    204.08,205.84
     So you're going to be holding and kinda,
},
{
    205.84,209.92
     you can decide how much pressure you wanna put into it, okay?
},
{
    209.92,213.36
     But you do wanna hold it for about 30, 60 seconds,
},
{
    213.36,216.6
     and then you want to find another spot.
},
{
    216.6,218.96
     Okay, so after you spend 30 seconds on that spot,
},
{
    218.96,220.48
     now maybe move it a little higher,
},
{
    220.48,222.8
     maybe a little bit lower,
},
{
    222.8,226.88
     and then, you know, try another spot, and then hold
},
{
    226.88,230.08
     it there for another 30, 60 seconds.
},
{
    230.08,233.16
     You could also move your other arm up and down a little bit.
},
{
    233.16,236.76
     I don't know if you can see that, like, actually let me do it the other side so you can see
},
{
    236.76,237.76
     that.
},
{
    237.76,238.76
     So again, same thing.
},
{
    238.76,246.64
     I'm going to place your arm, and you want to do this on both sides of course. So find a spot and then hold it for 30-60 seconds.
},
{
    246.64,254.28
     To add some extra deeper release of the muscle, you can also try to move your hand up and
},
{
    254.28,258.32
     down as I'm doing so.
},
{
    258.32,261.68
     Now just to be clear, the ball is not moving.
},
{
    261.68,266.96
     I'm not rolling, I'm just moving my hand, okay, so that the ball can get deeper
},
{
    266.96,270.36
     into the tissue of the muscle.
},
{
    270.36,275.68
     But basically again, 30, 60 seconds and then find another spot from there and you want
},
{
    275.68,277.56
     to do it on both sides of your chest.
},
{
    277.56,281.92
     Onto exercise number two and that's when we're going to start stretching the pec major and
},
{
    281.92,289.44
     pec minor muscles, okay, that we already did the self-massage to. So what you're gonna do is, there's many ways of doing it, but one
},
{
    289.44,294.04
     of them is you can place your palm on the wall here and then you're just
},
{
    294.04,300.72
     gonna kind of lean that way and start feeling the stretch in your chest, okay?
},
{
    300.72,307.96
     And you can lean into your, in my case, my right knee a little bit so you can go forward
},
{
    307.96,309.56
     as you feel the stretch.
},
{
    309.56,315.72
     Now, if you want to get even a deeper stretch, you can even look away from the hand.
},
{
    315.72,320.88
     Okay?
},
{
    320.88,321.88
     And then switch sides.
},
{
    321.88,322.88
     Okay?
},
{
    322.88,325.28
     So same thing on this side here. Place your
},
{
    325.28,330.88
     palm here, kind of lean a little bit forward on a diagonal here. Start feeling
},
{
    330.88,338.48
     the stretch in your chest and then you can lean away from it as well. And you
},
{
    338.48,343.16
     want to hold this stretch for about 30 seconds on each side and you want to do
},
{
    343.16,345.92
     about two sets every other day, okay?
},
{
    345.92,350.68
     The next exercise we're going to do is the forearm wall slide and this one
},
{
    350.68,356.72
     both stretches and creates mobility for the shoulder blades area and thoracic
},
{
    356.72,362.64
     spine as well as it also activates serratus interior and other muscles. So
},
{
    362.64,367.84
     let's get right into it. So what you're going to do is just place one leg in front of the other and then bring
},
{
    367.84,372.2
     your forearms onto the wall at about 90 degree angle.
},
{
    372.2,376.96
     And then all you're going to do is you're going to kind of slide up and then slide down.
},
{
    376.96,377.96
     Okay?
},
{
    377.96,383.64
     So you're going to be kind of moving slightly forward on the up part and then you're going
},
{
    383.64,385.14
     to come back again.
},
{
    385.14,389.9
     So you're going to go up and down.
},
{
    389.9,393.12
     You don't want to bring your shoulders up or anything like that.
},
{
    393.12,410.84
     You're just trying to move, to get mobility in your upper back, which is very important. And I recommend you do this one about 15 reps, 2 to 3 sets every other day.
},
{
    410.84,414.86
     The next exercise we're going to do is called the prone T's or there's many other names
},
{
    414.86,415.86
     to it.
},
{
    415.86,420.48
     Its main purpose is to activate those lower trapezius muscles that get weak and underactive
},
{
    420.48,423.08
     on most people who have rounded shoulders posture.
},
{
    423.08,425.72
     So you can do this one on the floor or on a bench.
},
{
    425.72,427.48
     I'm doing it on a bench here, okay?
},
{
    427.48,429.72
     And I'm just gonna place my arms on my sides.
},
{
    429.72,433.52
     And from here, all I'm gonna do is I'm going to externally
},
{
    433.52,435.4
     rotate my thumbs, okay?
},
{
    435.4,439.72
     And then I'm going to go up into a T position, okay?
},
{
    439.72,441.68
     And then bring it down, okay?
},
{
    441.68,442.52
     And again.
},
{
    448.28,454.12
     This is the Seaburn Lee harder than what it seems like. It's one of the hardest exercises. And you want to pinch your shoulder blades
},
{
    454.12,458.68
     together, okay? That's what's important for this one. You bring it up as high as
},
{
    458.68,469.86
     you can. T as you go out. And try not to also arch your back in this way.
},
{
    469.86,472.72
     It's not about arching your back at all.
},
{
    472.72,481.56
     This exercise is more about the mid-back.
},
{
    481.56,486.68
     You can also add some small weights to it if you find it too easy, okay?
},
{
    486.68,491.7
     You want to do about 15 reps, about 2 to 3 sets every other day.
},
{
    491.7,494.6
     The next exercise I'm going to show is called the floor angels.
},
{
    494.6,496.12
     People do them at the walls as well.
},
{
    496.12,497.72
     There's many different ways of doing it.
},
{
    497.72,503.48
     So you want to start in this position here with your feet on the floor, knees are bent,
},
{
    503.48,505.44
     and now you want to bring your low back to the floor as much as bent. And now you wanna bring your low back
},
{
    505.44,506.96
     to the floor as much as possible,
},
{
    506.96,508.32
     so you don't wanna arch your back.
},
{
    508.32,510.08
     You don't wanna have space here, okay?
},
{
    510.08,511.28
     As you're doing the exercise,
},
{
    511.28,513.68
     very important to not arch your back.
},
{
    513.68,516.72
     So you're gonna, again, think of your belly button
},
{
    516.72,518.8
     going towards the floor, okay?
},
{
    518.8,522.16
     So stomach in, arms on the floor,
},
{
    522.16,526.48
     and now exactly what it sounds like you're doing floor angels
},
{
    526.48,531.6
     okay some of you do this in the summertime in the snow I mean in the
},
{
    531.6,539.96
     winter time of course as you lie there in the snow you do this already so some of
},
{
    539.96,542.92
     you might already know how to do it but what's important here again is as I'm
},
{
    542.92,545.28
     bringing out that's where it gets harder,
},
{
    545.28,546.32
     and that's where a lot of people
},
{
    546.32,548.44
     wanna start arching their back.
},
{
    548.44,549.44
     You don't wanna do that.
},
{
    549.44,554.44
     So consciously, practice to bring your stomach to the floor,
},
{
    555.96,559.88
     so there's no space here as you're doing the exercise.
},
{
    559.88,562.96
     You're gonna straighten out into a Y position
},
{
    562.96,572.36
     and then bring your arms into a W. Right so again extend out into a Y and come back into a W. This is a very very
},
{
    572.36,582.96
     good exercise. And again you want to do this one about 15 reps two to three sets
},
{
    582.96,585.0
     every other day.
},
{
    585.0,586.0
     That's it for today.
},
{
    586.0,590.48
