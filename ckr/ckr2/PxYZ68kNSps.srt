     I'm Gene Lu and I'm an otolaryngologist head and neck surgeon or ear nose and throat doctor here in Los Angeles.
},
{
    5.0,8.0
     And today I wanted to talk briefly about how to use eardrops.
},
{
    8.0,12.0
     There are a lot of different types of drops that someone may use in their ear canal,
},
{
    12.0,15.0
     but the way that we get the drops in are all the same.
},
{
    15.0,20.0
     When we're using eardrops, we want to make sure that it goes down the ear canal to the eardrum.
},
{
    20.0,24.0
     Because a lot of ear canals are very thin and narrow and twisty,
},
{
    24.0,27.0
     it's going to take a little bit of manipulation to get the drops all the way in.
},
{
    27.0,34.0
     We generally want to either tilt our head or be lying down, and when we put in the drops, you need to wiggle the outer part of the ear
},
{
    34.0,41.0
     and also pump that little triangular guy called the tragus. That forces the liquid all the way down the ear canal.
},
{
    41.0,50.12
     In the perfect world, we almost always want to maintain that side position for a few minutes to let the drops do their work. Eventually, you can
},
{
    50.12,55.12
     get up and if you need to do the other side, you repeat. If you don't wiggle the ear or
},
{
    55.12,60.68
     pump the tragus, the drops don't get in nearly as well. If you're putting in the drops and
},
{
    60.68,68.28
     wiggling the ear and pumping the tragus and the drops aren't going in, it might be because there's a bunch of wax or the skin's peeling off or the infection
},
{
    68.28,70.22
     is filling the ear with goo.
},
{
    70.22,73.28
     If that's the case then you might need to see an ear nose and throat doctor to get the
},
{
    73.28,77.24
     ear cleaned out or suction so that the medicine can even get in.
},
{
    77.24,80.72
     Most of the time ear drops shouldn't hurt, but if the ear is a little bit inflamed or
},
{
    80.72,88.28
     if there's a scratch or scrape or if there's an ear tube and the drops can get in further, it sometimes can be a little bit uncomfortable.
},
{
    88.28,92.9
     If the ear drops hurt, sometimes there are good alternatives or other options that you
},
{
    92.9,96.82
     can switch to and other times you just have to tough it out but that's a discussion with
},
{
    96.82,98.42
     your doctor.
},
{
    98.42,102.98
     If you have ear tubes or if you possibly have a hole in the ear drum, there's going to be
},
{
    102.98,109.56
     a lot of drops that you're not supposed to use. There are only a few types of drops that we want going in that far. So
},
{
    109.56,114.36
     if you have concerns of a possible hole in the eardrum or if you have ear tubes, make
},
{
    114.36,118.16
     sure that you don't just grab any over the counter eardrop and start putting it in. Check
},
{
    118.16,123.56
     with your doctor first. Definitely in little kids getting drops in can be a bit of an adventure.
},
{
    123.56,126.0
     It could be hard to get them to hold still or lie down.
},
{
    126.0,131.0
     Their ear canals are smaller or more narrow so it's harder to physically get the drops in in the first place.
},
{
    131.0,136.0
     They might act up a little bit or revolt or squirm because they don't like that feeling of wetness.
},
{
    136.0,140.0
     And if they're already having an ear infection and the ear is uncomfortable,
},
{
    140.0,144.0
     they just don't want anybody touching it. Do what you can.
},
{
    144.0,147.64
     I hope this helped explain a little bit better about how to use ear drops. If you

    147.64,149.96
