     Hello, I'm Ben Welch and welcome to 442's YouTube channel and the latest episode of
},
{
    10.28,14.52
     the injury clinic. In today's episode we are going to be visiting the centre for health
},
{
    14.52,18.56
     and human performance and one of their top physios, Tom Jackson. Tom is going to show
},
{
    18.56,22.64
     us how to diagnose any injury and then rehab it back to match when you're strength so
},
{
    22.64,29.12
     we can get you back out on the pitch and play.
},
{
    33.44,37.76
     Okay so we're here with Tom Thomas, a beneficio for Charlton, Southampton and full of massively experienced, used to working with elite footballers, now it gets the work of a rubbish amateur
},
{
    37.76,44.16
     footballer like me. So Tom, thank you for taking this time to see us. So imagine average footballer
},
{
    44.16,47.96
     comes in place Sundays, plays Saturdays, maybe a five-side game.
},
{
    47.96,50.4
     He comes in and he says, Tom, I've hurt my knee.
},
{
    50.4,52.12
     What are the first things we do to establish
},
{
    52.12,53.16
     what's wrong with his knee?
},
{
    53.16,54.32
     Yeah, no problems.
},
{
    54.32,55.56
     So the first thing that we're gonna do
},
{
    55.56,56.96
     is have a good sit down and a chat
},
{
    56.96,59.52
     and find out what you've done and how you've done it.
},
{
    59.52,62.32
     So what I want to know is the mechanism of your injury.
},
{
    62.32,63.6
     Once we've gone through that assessment,
},
{
    63.6,66.46
     which we already have done, I want to go and have a look and
},
{
    66.46,70.44
     and see what you're looking like with regards to your knee.
},
{
    70.44,73.26
     So if you want to have a seat on the bed.
},
{
    73.26,79.18
     So just for everyone watching at home I did my knee I was playing in a game
},
{
    79.18,83.72
     someone shot I slid across them and their foot connected with the back of my
},
{
    83.72,86.38
     knee wasn't instantly painful but when I got up,
},
{
    86.38,87.5
     there was some instability in my knee
},
{
    87.5,90.02
     and it got in my knee and it felt a bit weird.
},
{
    90.02,91.66
     So key thing really is to look at,
},
{
    91.66,92.9
     A, I've seen you when you've walked in.
},
{
    92.9,95.1
     You've not walked in with any massive limp,
},
{
    95.1,96.84
     which is quite important.
},
{
    96.84,98.92
     You're obviously reasonably functional,
},
{
    98.92,100.66
     watched you in terms of when you get changed.
},
{
    100.66,103.62
     You're happy to stand on this leg,
},
{
    103.62,106.04
     happy to take shoes on and off and balance on it.
},
{
    106.04,108.44
     So there's nothing that is
},
{
    108.44,110.96
     screamingly obvious for me at this moment in time.
},
{
    110.96,113.16
     If I look comparatively at your knee,
},
{
    113.16,116.6
     there's no major swelling compared to the other side.
},
{
    116.6,119.6
     It doesn't feel hot to the touch compared to the other side
},
{
    119.6,121.4
     and it's not got a big bed area.
},
{
    121.4,123.8
     So it's not in a massive kind of inflammatory state
},
{
    123.8,127.84
     at this moment in time. So first thing we want to do is just see if there's any swelling. So I'm just going
},
{
    127.84,132.12
     to do a little kind of, it's called a sweep test. So from there I'm just going to brush
},
{
    132.12,136.32
     that fluid away. If there is any thing and if there was there'd be a little bled that
},
{
    136.32,141.24
     would come out into this area effectively of fluid. So that's looking at is there anything
},
{
    141.24,147.4
     within the knee joint itself that's causing inflammation and swelling at the moment, not for you.
},
{
    147.4,150.0
     So then I'm going to move on and look at your range of movement.
},
{
    150.0,154.2
     So bit of hyper extension, that's pretty normal for you.
},
{
    154.2,157.6
     So we've got a little ligament in the inside of your knee here.
},
{
    157.6,159.4
     That, that, that, that isn't that.
},
{
    159.4,160.4
     That's quite unpleasant.
},
{
    160.4,163.2
     Yeah, that really does, yeah.
},
{
    163.2,166.9
     The meniscus and the medial ligament kind of communicate
},
{
    166.9,170.74
     with each other. So there's fibres that go on and attach from that medial ligament onto
},
{
    170.74,174.96
     the meniscus. So the two can be damaged and I think there's probably some damage around
},
{
    174.96,179.76
     that area for you. I think you've done deep fibres of your medial ligament. So that's
},
{
    179.76,187.0
     where I rotate your leg outwards and then apply that lateral or medial force from the outside here.
},
{
    187.0,190.36
     So I'm gapping this medial ligament and stressing you.
},
{
    190.36,191.76
     That's causing you some discomfort.
},
{
    203.04,204.64
     Hey Tom, so we've assessed my knee.
},
{
    204.64,207.08
     We've seen that it probably needs a little bit further investigation,
},
{
    207.08,211.04
     we need to get a scan, but imagine a frustrated footballer, they're injured, they need to
},
{
    211.04,214.6
     wait for the scan, what can they do in the meantime to maybe improve their situation?
},
{
    214.6,220.42
     So key thing for you at the moment is to make sure that we've got some stability. So irrespective
},
{
    220.42,224.68
     of whether there's an injury that needs to go and have surgery or not, you need to get
},
{
    224.68,228.16
     that hip stability particularly better. So we saw when you were doing that
},
{
    228.16,231.36
     single leg squat particularly on the right side, you were a bit all over the place. So
},
{
    231.36,234.36
     we need to make that a little bit better for you. We're going to give you some glute exercise
},
{
    234.36,237.68
     to do. So if I can ask you to lie down on the mat. From this position, I'm going to ask
},
{
    237.68,242.24
     you to bridge up. So you're going to push up through your heels and lift your bottom
},
{
    242.24,245.08
     off the floor. That's it, good and then slowly
},
{
    245.08,252.08
     lower right down again. Okay, so same thing, rolling up, squeezing that glute back down.
},
{
    252.08,256.74
     Good. We'll come back now, we're going to do the same things. Another squiffle bridge.
},
{
    256.74,263.16
     What this is doing is adding an element of balance into it as well. So the idea is to
},
{
    263.16,265.0
     keep your feet flat on the ball,
},
{
    265.0,267.48
     bring your knees again about hip width apart,
},
{
    267.48,269.2
     and from that position, it's exactly the same
},
{
    269.2,270.16
     as you had before.
},
{
    270.16,271.72
     To start with, we're just gonna work
},
{
    271.72,273.96
     a small amplitude of movement.
},
{
    273.96,275.64
     I don't want you coming all the way up.
},
{
    275.64,276.72
     So that's a bit big to start with.
},
{
    276.72,278.68
     So just there to start with, back down,
},
{
    278.68,280.6
     just until you get that control.
},
{
    281.8,283.48
     I'll do three or four of those.
},
{
    287.0,290.6
     So to start with, I just going to get you just down to one foot, slight bend in your
},
{
    290.6,296.44
     knee and we're just going to stay in that position. You want a little bit of an unstable
},
{
    296.44,301.0
     surface on this mat, albeit it's very thin. We can make it harder by adding more unstable
},
{
    301.0,305.68
     surfaces so if you're at home, stand on a pillow, stand on a cushion, something like that,
},
{
    305.68,307.44
     providing you've got good stability.
},
{
    307.44,310.32
     And you can see as you're working here,
},
{
    310.32,313.08
     muscles in the lower leg are working hard,
},
{
    313.08,314.96
     glutes are working to stabilize,
},
{
    314.96,316.84
     and there's just a little bit of rock in there.
},
{
    316.84,319.24
     I'll ask you to close your eyes from that position.
},
{
    321.0,324.56
     See straight away, that becomes much harder.
},
{
    324.56,329.0
     So you take away the visual cues, and that becomes a harder exercise straight way.
},
{
    329.0,333.0
     So the other thing you can do is just standing on your right leg,
},
{
    333.0,338.0
     just do some rotational stuff.
},
{
    338.0,341.0
     Just controlling around.
},
{
    341.0,344.0
     We can obviously make that more fun towards the latter stages
},
{
    344.0,347.76
     where we're getting you kicking a football there's somebody throwing a football back we've
},
{
    347.76,350.32
     even got one here at the moment somebody throwing a football back you're doing
},
{
    350.32,354.04
     some volleys just to start with we're just doing a little bit of pop it back
},
{
    354.04,361.72
     chest past me so don't be worried I can catch. So just gonna pop it get you moving
},
{
    361.72,366.0
     and then in a second we're gonna to just take you off and change that
},
{
    366.0,367.0
     range.
},
{
    367.0,368.0
     Alright?
},
{
    368.0,370.16
     We've heard all this stuff from Tom, we've worked on some exercises now and he's going
},
{
    370.16,375.0
     to have my scan to get to the root of the problem and then we can move on.
},
{
    375.0,384.16
     Okay Tom, so a few months have passed since I first come to CU, injured in October, come
},
{
    384.16,387.6
     to see in November, we did a few sessions and then we decided that
},
{
    387.6,388.84
     with the way Nene was reacting,
},
{
    388.84,390.56
     it's better to ease off.
},
{
    390.56,393.44
     Why is that important and kind of what are the benefits
},
{
    393.44,397.08
     of doing that as a patient and what kind of things
},
{
    397.08,399.32
     would you be looking out for in that period of rest?
},
{
    399.32,402.24
     So during any kind of reactive process with a knee,
},
{
    402.24,404.74
     we're into an inflammatory state.
},
{
    404.74,405.2
     Information takes quite a while to calm down. With your own knee, we're into an inflammatory state. Information
},
{
    405.2,409.28
     takes quite a while to calm down. With your own knee, we were getting to a point where
},
{
    409.28,412.64
     we were almost exacerbating that information with the loading that we were doing. So, in
},
{
    412.64,416.84
     able to give it a tone of rest, it allows that information to settle down, allows you
},
{
    416.84,420.96
     to start to improve again in terms of the feeling that you were feeling in the knee.
},
{
    420.96,428.8
     You had a level of instability that you were noticing. That subsequently settled down. Alongside the exercise program that you were doing,
},
{
    428.8,433.46
     it allows the muscles to activate and you get more proprioception, which is the control
},
{
    433.46,438.76
     within your knee, where your knee is in space, allows those muscles to work a lot more and
},
{
    438.76,442.96
     just you generally become very stronger. So in the previous sessions that we've had,
},
{
    442.96,448.54
     we've been working on strength and control of your knee. Those exercises that we've just done there are
},
{
    448.54,451.78
     a lot of kind of the end stage rehabilitation exercises. They're based
},
{
    451.78,455.94
     on whole body control movements and they're going to put your knee under
},
{
    455.94,460.7
     significant stress in terms of control and patterning and if you're unable to
},
{
    460.7,464.9
     keep those patterns up then you're basically not going to be fit to return
},
{
    464.9,465.52
     to sport.
},
{
    465.52,469.92
     So I'm looking at, by completing those, are you now at a stage where we can progress you
},
{
    469.92,472.48
     back into a football type scenario?
},
{
    472.48,474.24
     Lateral bounds off the bosu.
},
{
    474.24,478.6
     Really great exercise to test your balance and your control as you land on the floor
},
{
    478.6,480.26
     on that static leg.
},
{
    480.26,484.64
     Things like the ice skaters, again, look, they're a great whole body workout.
},
{
    484.64,489.2
     They're going to work your glutes, which is the key muscles for stabilization of your lower limb.
},
{
    489.2,492.64
     The viper step backs, which is what everyone's coming through here.
},
{
    492.64,497.44
     Again, a really strong exercise for both the hip mobility.
},
{
    497.44,506.0
     The drop downs off the box are actually a really good exercise for putting high level of load of eccentric
},
{
    506.0,510.4
     strength through your quads, getting your glutes again to absorb and stabilize your
},
{
    510.4,514.32
     your proximal body weight and also loading into the tendon. And then the final one that
},
{
    514.32,520.08
     we did was the plyometric box jumps and that's a pure explosive exercise. Can you generate
},
{
    520.08,525.4
     sufficient force through your both your legs in order to drive up onto that 24-inch
},
{
    525.4,529.8
     box. There's a pretty decent size box as you felt and then can you control that
},
{
    529.8,534.24
     movement on the way back down again. So lowering down on the affected side. So at
},
{
    534.24,539.2
     this stage in the rehabilitation I want your knee to feel normal effectively. If
},
{
    539.2,544.04
     you're still feeling like it's unstable or you're getting some pain or
},
{
    544.04,546.28
     particularly if your knee reacts subsequently,
},
{
    546.28,547.88
     then you're probably too far,
},
{
    547.88,549.48
     or you're trying to do too much too early
},
{
    549.48,552.56
     and you need to go back a stage into the strengthening phase
},
{
    552.56,554.84
     before you can start loading up onto that side.
},
{
    554.84,556.84
     We are four months along now,
},
{
    566.84,568.16
     from when I first come to see you. What stage are we at?
},
{
    568.16,569.16
     Where's my knee at?
},
{
    569.16,571.88
     And now what are we looking to push on with next?
},
{
    571.88,574.52
     So your knee now is really nice and stable.
},
{
    574.52,575.72
     Ligaments are looking really strong.
},
{
    575.72,577.2
     There's no laxity within the knee.
},
{
    577.2,579.16
     There's no pain in the knee when I'm testing it.
},
{
    579.16,580.96
     So really fantastic.
},
{
    580.96,584.36
     You've done loads of work in the gym in terms of your balance work, which is fundamentally
},
{
    584.36,586.64
     most important. And you've done a lot of strength work.
},
{
    586.64,589.52
     So that strength work is going to give you really good stability in your knee.
},
{
    589.52,594.08
     Now it's a matter of testing out to see that you're able to cope with the
},
{
    594.08,597.6
     stresses of football, prior to putting you back onto a football pitch and making
},
{
    597.6,600.76
     sure that you're fine with all that before releasing you to go and play again.
},
{
    600.76,607.2
     Now today we're ramping up the pressure on the knee, the movement, the mobility.
},
{
    607.2,611.6
     Can you just briefly explain what we're doing in the gym and what those exercises, what are we
},
{
    611.6,616.16
     testing and looking for? So today we're going to start to kind of transition you through to
},
{
    616.16,621.44
     striking a football and multi-directional movement. We're going to look at a bit of ballistic stuff
},
{
    621.44,628.24
     in terms of your jumping and your reactive strength from that. Then we're also going to look at some of the kind of kicking mechanisms
},
{
    628.24,632.88
     for you. And then finally just do some multi-directional drills where we're trying to get you to change
},
{
    632.88,637.92
     direction and work off both legs so that you can then take that out onto a football pitch
},
{
    637.92,645.48
     in your rehabilitation and have a confidence you've already exposed yourself to those movements. Right, so let's go in the gym and see how my knee holds up. That's the one.
},
{
    647.48,648.32
     And here.
},
{
    651.82,653.14
     One.
},
{
    653.14,653.98
     One.
},
{
    654.94,656.28
     One.
},
{
    656.28,658.12
