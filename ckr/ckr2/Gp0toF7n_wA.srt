     Hi, I'm Dr. Adam Fields. I'm so glad you're here. We're talking about you
},
{
    4.44,8.36
     station tube dysfunction. I've been getting calls and emails. I've been
},
{
    8.36,14.46
     getting people flying in to get treated, people driving great distances, and I want
},
{
    14.46,17.64
     to give you some more tools. I want to give you some tools that you can use at
},
{
    17.64,22.1
     home and also I want to share with you what I do in my office if that if need
},
{
    22.1,25.84
     be. So you know I've been getting questions. Let's go over some of them.
},
{
    25.84,26.68
     I got it.
},
{
    26.68,28.2
     Wendy sent me a beautiful email.
},
{
    28.2,31.68
     Oh my gosh, she said, I came across some of your helpful
},
{
    31.68,34.8
     YouTube videos as I was searching out of sheer frustration.
},
{
    34.8,37.08
     And I know that's a lot of you out there.
},
{
    37.08,38.76
     Your ears are going through it.
},
{
    38.76,41.52
     You're trying to accommodate to them.
},
{
    41.52,44.4
     You go up into altitude and they're getting tight.
},
{
    44.4,49.3
     My ear has been plugged for 18 months or after a bad infection. That sounds dire,
},
{
    49.3,54.66
     but I've had some people come into my office after 30 years of a plugged ear
},
{
    54.66,60.5
     and get unplugged. Nothing has relieved it and the ENT put a tube in a
},
{
    60.5,64.58
     diagnostic tool. He said it would provide instant relief and it hasn't worked. It has
},
{
    64.58,68.84
     been a week and I am miserable. My ear is plugged, there's a dull ache and I
},
{
    68.84,75.28
     feel like I'm in an echo chamber and I can hear my heart beating in my ear. I went back
},
{
    75.28,79.84
     and they asked if I wanted it removed. I had no idea what to say and they advised me to
},
{
    79.84,84.56
     wait another week. I'm getting no relief at all. They told me next steps are different
},
{
    84.56,85.36
     drugs. A lot of you are here right now because you don't want drugs. I'm getting no relief at all. They told me next steps are different drugs.
},
{
    85.36,89.6
     A lot of you are here right now because you don't want drugs. I don't want to try a bunch of drugs
},
{
    89.6,95.52
     and they are offering no other ideas. I have to find some relief. I realize that you're in California
},
{
    95.52,100.8
     and I have no need and you have no need to respond to me but I'm feeling quite desperate.
},
{
    100.8,105.52
     With our medical system it took me nine months to see an ENT and getting another
},
{
    105.52,111.24
     opinion, especially during COVID will be next to impossible. I'm wondering if you would be
},
{
    111.24,116.44
     able to give me any thoughts or guidance. So this is it. I want to give you guys guidance.
},
{
    116.44,123.44
     Number one, one of the things that I do that is just amazing, the Muncie technique. So
},
{
    123.44,127.0
     in the in here, this is a schematic here. This is the opening
},
{
    127.0,132.7
     for your use station tube right here. It goes from your middle ear right to here. A lot
},
{
    132.7,137.82
     of you have tight throats, a lot of you have mucus and inflammation that's gone that way
},
{
    137.82,149.02
     for a long period of time. That mucus can build up on the outside of your station tube, it can get hardened even, it can even grow micro blood vessels
},
{
    149.02,152.78
     and coat the outside of this thing and inhibit
},
{
    152.78,156.06
     that flow, that emptying, right?
},
{
    156.06,159.7
     So one of the things I do is called the Muncie Technique and I go into the mouth
},
{
    159.7,166.52
     and I massage there and it can be a number of days to have it done but we get it to
},
{
    166.52,170.28
     free up and people, oh when they're doing it sometimes they can hear a little
},
{
    170.28,176.24
     sound in there and it's wonderful. The first thing I do before though doing this
},
{
    176.24,180.48
     I make sure people are on a low inflammation diet and one of those things
},
{
    180.48,184.8
     are I get rid of gluten, sugar and dairy. You guys if you're eating a bunch of
},
{
    184.8,187.64
     sugar and you're eating a bunch of pasta and bread
},
{
    187.64,192.76
     and things like that and you want to get well in those years, it's going to be tough.
},
{
    192.76,197.36
     This is what we call, this isn't a sickness or a problem, this is called a health opportunity,
},
{
    197.36,198.36
     right?
},
{
    198.36,203.48
     This is your body knocking on the door going, I've got to get healthier, please help me.
},
{
    203.48,206.76
     And one of those things is low inflammation diet.
},
{
    206.76,208.26
     Get rid of the sugar.
},
{
    208.26,210.16
     It's evil.
},
{
    210.16,213.88
     Also to decrease that inflammation, I have people do probiotics.
},
{
    213.88,216.24
     I put them on a very specific plan.
},
{
    216.24,218.44
     I use a company called Microbiome Labs.
},
{
    218.44,221.24
     They have, go on my website, check it out.
},
{
    221.24,222.24
     It's very good.
},
{
    222.24,230.32
     If you want information on it, I can help you. They're spores because normal probiotics, they don't make it through the 1.5 to 3.5
},
{
    230.32,234.6
     pH of the stomach and populate in the small and large intestines where they're supposed
},
{
    234.6,240.52
     to. They actually, it gets, they get killed, right? And these are spores, they're naturally
},
{
    240.52,248.66
     encapsulated, they get past that gut and they open up with something called quorum sensing and they start doing their things. They're regulators,
},
{
    248.66,253.56
     they increase the good, decrease the bad and help balance things out. So anyway,
},
{
    253.56,259.08
     low inflammation diet, the Muncie technique, these are really good
},
{
    259.08,262.8
     techniques. I feel my ears are filled with fluid whenever I drink something
},
{
    262.8,265.2
     cold. I also feel clicks and often in my ears, filled with fluid. Whenever I drink something cold, I also feel clicks,
},
{
    265.2,268.08
     and often in my ears, mostly difficult to sleep at night,
},
{
    268.08,270.96
     getting pressure, like pain in my ears.
},
{
    270.96,274.0
     Sometimes I also feel my ears clogged.
},
{
    274.0,275.8
     Are these symptoms of ears clogged?
},
{
    275.8,278.88
     Sounds like they're symptoms of ear clogged to me.
},
{
    278.88,282.52
     However, why is that clogging happening?
},
{
    282.52,287.36
     Sometimes the mucosal linings can be inflamed and stuck and close that thing down.
},
{
    287.88,292.46
     So besides those two things that I just gave you the Muncie and the low inflammation diet,
},
{
    293.08,297.72
     regular chiropractic care, the nerves that go to the Eustachian tubes,
},
{
    297.88,302.8
     stimulate muscles like the tensor villi palletini muscle, that wave-like contraction that
},
{
    303.16,305.42
     empties out the Eustachian tube.
},
{
    305.42,309.62
     So chiropractic care or corrective care like I do is very good.
},
{
    309.62,316.1
     The pedabond technique, also the chiropractic biophysics technique, these are what I consider
},
{
    316.1,319.02
     very, very high-end chiropractic care.
},
{
    319.02,321.14
     What else can you do?
},
{
    321.14,324.18
     I like something called oil pulling.
},
{
    324.18,326.68
     I found some results with that.
},
{
    326.68,329.44
     These are things I often, I'll help people do them like they're going to fly in and
},
{
    329.44,333.3
     I'll say okay do these things, do the get on the low inflammation diet, get on the oil
},
{
    333.3,338.92
     pulling, some other things before you come so you can maybe not have to take the trip.
},
{
    338.92,346.76
     The oil pulling, you get a heaping tablespoon of coconut oil, put it in your mouth, and just swish it around.
},
{
    346.76,350.28
     Go take a walk or something so you don't have to be around people and talk because you won't
},
{
    350.28,351.6
     be able to talk.
},
{
    351.6,357.56
     And what you'll find is after about 15 minutes, you'll feel like this clump of mucus come
},
{
    357.56,359.88
     down in the back of the throat.
},
{
    359.88,363.36
     And you'll have to swallow it because it's way back there, but just swallow it.
},
{
    363.36,367.9
     And then once you get to the 20 minutes, spit the oil out, wash your mouth out, that oil is now just full
},
{
    367.9,375.9
     of gunk. And oftentimes or sometimes actually you can get some results that way also. So
},
{
    375.9,382.5
     what else? I do something called endonasal cranial adjusting in my office. A lot of people
},
{
    382.5,390.82
     have asked me about it. The skull bones can go out of alignment. There are 22 bones that fit together like pieces in a jigsaw
},
{
    390.82,397.48
     puzzle and it could be boxing, it could be a punch, it could be dehydration, hunching.
},
{
    397.48,406.44
     These skull bones can actually lose that perfect alignment and that can affect the back of the throat, it can affect the nose, it can
},
{
    406.44,412.2
     affect fluid flow dynamics and I actually do a technique where I put a balloon in
},
{
    412.2,417.84
     the nose with a toothpick and go into certain parts of the nose and actually
},
{
    417.84,428.0
     adjust those skull bones and I've had a lot of people's ears open up that way also, or even a combination of the two.
},
{
    428.0,433.0
     I also use laser in the office, which can decrease inflammation there, help people with,
},
{
    433.0,438.0
     I've had great results with tinnitus. There's something else I want to share with you.
},
{
    438.0,448.28
     One of the ways that I found out about a lot of this stuff is I actually redid a couple of houses and was living there because we couldn't afford to go and live somewhere
},
{
    448.28,452.8
     else where we were redoing the houses and I got some fungus in my nose and I
},
{
    452.8,459.44
     went to so many different places I did the diet thing I did my cranial
},
{
    459.44,469.3
     adjustments I did as much as I could and I still had this problem and I went to a friend friend of mine who's a dentist and I went to also another one who's a naturopath
},
{
    469.3,471.02
     that use ozone.
},
{
    471.02,472.32
     And ozone is very toxic.
},
{
    472.32,473.32
     It's O3, right?
},
{
    473.32,475.84
     You don't want to breathe this stuff in.
},
{
    475.84,481.0
     But if you can take a big breath in, it's called an ozone nasal insufflation.
},
{
    481.0,485.86
     You take a big breath in and you put about 40 ml into your nose and you hold it for about
},
{
    485.86,489.84
     30 seconds and it burns if you've got fungus up there.
},
{
    489.84,494.16
     And then you breathe out of your nose, run away from that area because you don't want
},
{
    494.16,496.72
     to inhale it into your lungs.
},
{
    496.72,503.6
     And I had this burning, I did it three days and this, after years of fungus in my nose,
},
{
    503.6,506.84
     zero sugar diet, etc., this thing opened up
},
{
    506.84,509.76
     and has been clear and absolutely wonderful.
},
{
    509.76,511.96
     So I recommend that to you.
},
{
    511.96,513.48
     I recommend that to a lot of people.
},
{
    513.48,519.0
     I mean, there's more questions here and there's more people that have called, texted, you
},
{
    519.0,522.32
     name it, they're getting ahold of me.
},
{
    522.32,527.0
     And these are wonderful things that are going to help you. I like the laser, I like
},
{
    527.0,532.84
     the oil pulling, the ozone, the endonasal cranial adjusting, the low inflammation diet
},
{
    532.84,540.64
     is a must and the Muncie technique. So find someone in your area that does these things
},
{
    540.64,547.84
     or just start doing them one at a time and continue with the exercises. We've got to get the back of that throat opened up.
},
{
    547.84,549.6
     We've got a massage out here.
},
{
    549.6,554.12
     We're going to be coming out with some more videos, one that's specifically for tinnitus
},
{
    554.12,557.56
     or tinnitus, whichever you like to say, tomato, tomato.
},
{
    557.56,558.88
     But I'm with you.
},
{
    558.88,560.04
     I'm with you on this.
},
{
    560.04,563.12
     I know this is just challenging.
},
{
    563.12,565.84
     I've had desperate people, oh, my ears,
},
{
    565.84,568.26
     oh, I'm ringing, that kind of thing.
},
{
    568.26,571.4
     But I think these are some really good tools
},
{
    571.4,573.4
     that you can start to use.
},
{
    573.4,575.48
     Thank you for tuning in.
},
{
    575.48,578.18
     If you like this stuff, please post it on social media.
},
{
    578.18,579.12
     Tell your story.
},
{
    579.12,580.36
     People need to hear it,
},
{
    580.36,582.24
     because there's more people suffering out there.
},
{
    582.24,587.3
     And my goal is for us not to need some healthcare system.
},
{
    588.14,591.76
     My goal is for us to be able to be more and more self-sustained,
},
{
    591.76,595.66
     to take care of ourselves, to be the captain of our ship,
},
{
    595.66,598.68
     to really take a hold of our health.
},
{
    599.78,600.62
     Go get them.
},
