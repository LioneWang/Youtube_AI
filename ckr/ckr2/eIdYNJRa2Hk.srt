     Back to the future, that's what reminded me of that movie.
},
{
    67.4,71.8
     Anyways, elbow pain, tennis elbow,
},
{
    71.8,73.12
     you know what else can it be called?
},
{
    73.12,74.52
     This is not golf.
},
{
    74.52,75.76
     Lateral epiconics.
},
{
    75.76,77.32
     Right, right.
},
{
    77.32,78.64
     Very common.
},
{
    78.64,79.88
     Typically it's one of those things
},
{
    79.88,81.88
     that I think everyone experiences.
},
{
    81.88,82.96
     Sometimes in their life.
},
{
    82.96,86.04
     I do believe it's more male than female.
},
{
    86.04,88.32
     I don't have the statistics on that.
},
{
    88.32,92.62
     One way or another, can you see that red dot?
},
{
    92.62,95.72
     Oftentimes that's where the heart of the pain is.
},
{
    95.72,96.56
     It's a small area.
},
{
    96.56,98.04
     He put a marker on his arms.
},
{
    98.04,100.96
     Yeah, that's not a bruise or anything.
},
{
    100.96,104.72
     Yes, it's water soluble, it'll wash off.
},
{
    104.72,107.44
     But if you find that, there's that bone there,
},
{
    107.44,108.6
     and if you push on it,
},
{
    108.6,111.28
     because I have a mild case of it right now,
},
{
    111.28,112.16
     it's tendered.
},
{
    112.16,115.24
     If you've got a severe case, boy, just touch that,
},
{
    115.24,117.0
     and it is very uncomfortable.
},
{
    117.0,118.86
     I've experienced that in the past.
},
{
    118.86,122.16
     Now, what's going on there is all these muscles
},
{
    122.16,123.56
     on the top of your forearm,
},
{
    123.56,126.42
     they're responsible for extending your wrist
},
{
    126.42,129.5
     and opening your fingers or extending your fingers up.
},
{
    129.5,133.0
     They all end up attaching to that point.
},
{
    133.0,136.84
     So with a lot of hand activity, pronation
},
{
    136.84,138.36
     and supination of the wrist.
},
{
    138.36,139.92
     A lot of gripping activity.
},
{
    139.92,142.28
     It's like if you're pruning or something like that.
},
{
    142.28,148.84
     Overuse and those tendons where they connected the bone become inflamed, tender, and it's just no fun.
},
{
    148.84,151.52
     So we've done other videos on this
},
{
    151.52,153.28
     and we've done some really good treatments,
},
{
    153.28,155.76
     but this is something new to us.
},
{
    155.76,157.8
     It's a different technique and we're kind of becoming
},
{
    157.8,158.64
     believers.
},
{
    158.64,160.6
     And it's easier than the other ones.
},
{
    160.6,162.24
     Sure, and it did help you.
},
{
    162.24,163.68
     It's not permanent, right?
},
{
    163.68,164.88
     It gave you relief.
},
{
    164.88,165.72
     Right. But then you went back and did a bunch of stuff. Well, and it did help you. It's not permanent, right? It gave you relief. Right.
},
{
    165.72,167.12
     But then you went back and did a bunch of stuff.
},
{
    167.12,168.84
     Well, I quit doing the exercise.
},
{
    168.84,170.48
     It only takes 90 seconds,
},
{
    170.48,172.32
     but I quit and my mic's falling off.
},
{
    172.32,174.64
     And so I need to get back to it.
},
{
    174.64,175.48
     You need to stick with it.
},
{
    175.48,179.12
     Right, I broke my, I'm my own worst patient.
},
{
    179.12,180.48
     I know, I know that.
},
{
    180.48,181.52
     All right, here we go.
},
{
    181.52,182.8
     Here's the technique.
},
{
    182.8,185.76
     First thing you wanna do is we wanna relax those muscles.
},
{
    185.76,187.48
     Everything else must be relaxed.
},
{
    187.48,192.04
     Don't do this unless you're in a calm situation.
},
{
    192.04,193.84
     Works much more effectively.
},
{
    193.84,196.76
     We're going to put these muscles.
},
{
    196.76,199.24
     This is called positional release, by the way.
},
{
    199.24,202.68
     It's a whole system that's been out for decades, actually.
},
{
    202.68,204.24
     Just to be called strain, counter strain?
},
{
    204.24,206.12
     Exactly, right, Bob. So to be called strain, counter strain? Exactly right, Bob.
},
{
    206.12,208.64
     So we want to do the counter strain
},
{
    208.64,210.44
     and actually relax these muscles.
},
{
    210.44,212.6
     So we're gonna do that by shortening them.
},
{
    212.6,215.24
     We're gonna take your other hand
},
{
    215.24,217.96
     and we're going to extend the wrist
},
{
    219.02,221.4
     and the fingers, okay?
},
{
    221.4,223.24
     Now we're not gonna push on them really hard
},
{
    223.24,225.8
     and get an aggressive stretch by any means.
},
{
    225.8,228.64
     This is where this is such a nice thing to do
},
{
    228.64,230.44
     to yourself, self-treatment,
},
{
    230.44,235.44
     is you wanna get the position of most comfort
},
{
    235.44,237.4
     and I need to take one step backwards.
},
{
    237.4,241.0
     Before we do that, we want to go to the muscle belly,
},
{
    241.0,243.84
     which again is up in this area.
},
{
    243.84,245.98
     So the muscle belly is below the wrist
},
{
    245.98,247.3
     and above the elbow.
},
{
    247.3,251.26
     And you just wanna feel around, or we call palpate,
},
{
    251.26,252.58
     and go back and forth.
},
{
    252.58,255.46
     You're gonna find more than likely a ropey muscle.
},
{
    255.46,257.62
     And it's gonna be tender.
},
{
    257.62,259.66
     Even if you don't have tennis elbow, you'll find these.
},
{
    259.66,261.7
     But they're more pronounced with tennis elbow.
},
{
    261.7,263.06
     Mine is right there.
},
{
    263.06,264.7
     And I'm gonna push on it.
},
{
    265.42,266.26
     Use the tips of your fingers. Yeah right there. And I'm gonna push on it. And it's-
},
{
    266.26,267.26
     Use the tips of your fingers.
},
{
    267.26,268.46
     Yep, exactly.
},
{
    268.46,269.62
     And give it a number.
},
{
    269.62,273.42
     So 10 is maximum pain, zero is there soft
},
{
    273.42,275.38
     and I don't feel it pain at all.
},
{
    275.38,277.62
     I would give mine about a six,
},
{
    277.62,279.34
     depending on how hard I push.
},
{
    279.34,280.58
     See, I'd give mine a three.
},
{
    280.58,282.3
     Okay, yeah, because you don't have a flare up.
},
{
    282.3,283.14
     I don't have a flare up.
},
{
    283.14,284.66
     So just keep that in mind.
},
{
    284.66,285.64
     And we're gonna go back
},
{
    285.64,287.64
     and we're gonna assess it to see if the technique
},
{
    287.64,288.78
     was effective.
},
{
    288.78,290.64
     So we're gonna go back to where it was,
},
{
    290.64,292.28
     sorry about that.
},
{
    292.28,293.68
     Extend the wrist.
},
{
    293.68,294.52
     Now.
},
{
    294.52,295.36
     You should have it on something.
},
{
    295.36,297.22
     Yeah, let's grab the pillows.
},
{
    298.88,299.72
     Hurry up, Bob.
},
{
    299.72,300.56
     People are waiting.
},
{
    300.56,302.28
     There you go, thank you.
},
{
    302.28,304.6
     Yeah, this helps relax the whole arm.
},
{
    304.6,306.4
     Right, you don't want to have it hanging up in the air.
},
{
    306.4,307.4
     There's no way to relax.
},
{
    307.4,312.3
     So again, we're going to extend the wrist and the fingers.
},
{
    312.3,314.48
     But again, if say the finger extension
},
{
    314.48,316.76
     doesn't seem to make it better
},
{
    316.76,318.16
     or part of it makes it worse,
},
{
    318.16,319.4
     you don't have to do all that.
},
{
    319.4,323.0
     You're the boss, you're going to go listen to your body.
},
{
    323.0,324.52
     And oftentimes you're going to find,
},
{
    324.52,325.76
     that might be enough right there.
},
{
    325.76,328.04
     That might feel comfortable there.
},
{
    328.04,331.12
     But you may wanna rotate away.
},
{
    331.12,332.6
     So the thumb is pointing towards you,
},
{
    332.6,335.88
     go away from, so the thumb goes away from your body.
},
{
    335.88,338.72
     Maintain the finger and wrist extension
},
{
    338.72,339.56
     while you're doing it.
},
{
    339.56,340.4
     Right.
},
{
    340.4,342.08
     Now with me, if I go too far,
},
{
    342.08,343.2
     it starts to hurt a little bit.
},
{
    343.2,345.14
     So I go back to here, right there.
},
{
    345.14,347.9
     I can feel it, it feels good.
},
{
    347.9,350.54
     And once you get this point, as you probably are thinking,
},
{
    350.54,352.62
     what's the 90 second part all about?
},
{
    352.62,356.46
     You have to do all this before the 90 second timer goes.
},
{
    356.46,359.7
     I'm there right now, and you really need to look at a clock
},
{
    359.7,363.6
     or a watch or whatever, and go for 90 seconds.
},
{
    363.6,366.76
     Relax, breathing, relax through the 90 seconds.
},
{
    366.76,368.66
     You'll be amazed how long 90 seconds
},
{
    368.66,370.56
     takes when you need to be like this.
},
{
    370.56,371.8
     So Brad, while you're doing that,
},
{
    371.8,374.24
     now I can do it also on a tabletop.
},
{
    374.24,375.48
     Yeah, there's other options.
},
{
    375.48,377.32
     Yep, you could try this, the CL goal.
},
{
    377.32,379.72
     I can go like this, right?
},
{
    379.72,383.72
     And I turn the thumb out that way, right?
},
{
    383.72,385.56
     And I can be pretty relaxed like this.
},
{
    385.56,386.4
     Right.
},
{
    386.4,388.14
     If that works better than this,
},
{
    388.14,391.12
     that's the position you do it for 90 seconds.
},
{
    391.12,393.92
     Let's say we're at 88, 89, 90 seconds.
},
{
    393.92,395.88
     If you want to go longer, that's fine.
},
{
    395.88,396.72
     Sure.
},
{
    396.72,397.8
     But not less.
},
{
    397.8,401.36
     And then it's really important when you relax
},
{
    401.36,402.76
     is take it slowly.
},
{
    402.76,405.84
     What has happened is that it's actually released
},
{
    405.84,406.88
     the muscle spindles.
},
{
    406.88,409.84
     This is a neurological phenomenon, I feel,
},
{
    409.84,413.32
     but it's been studied scientifically pretty extensively.
},
{
    413.32,416.52
     It relaxes the tight muscle
},
{
    416.52,419.96
     and allows blood flow and circulation to become maximized,
},
{
    419.96,422.48
     which offers that release,
},
{
    422.48,425.44
     release the pain and improve circulation.
},
{
    425.44,427.12
     So you don't want to jump in and move it right away.
},
{
    427.12,427.96
     No, no.
},
{
    429.16,430.0
     Play out.
},
{
    430.0,434.08
     Let it get the full effect of the shortening of the muscle.
},
{
    434.08,434.92
     Right.
},
{
    434.92,438.28
     And then slowly you can do some gentle range of motion
},
{
    438.28,439.36
     of the wrist.
},
{
    439.36,442.4
     You can do some circles, but don't do this
},
{
    442.4,446.0
     and then go into an aggressive project or something where you're gonna
},
{
    446.0,447.04
     work your wrist.
},
{
    447.04,449.52
     You need to let it relax after that, take advantage of that.
},
{
    449.52,451.24
     So then we wanna try it again, right?
},
{
    451.24,453.56
     Yeah, go back to that spot you were at,
},
{
    453.56,456.56
     and then push on it and go back and forth.
},
{
    456.56,459.84
     Now mine was at a six, I can still feel right there.
},
{
    459.84,461.52
     I'd say it's down to about a three.
},
{
    461.52,462.96
     It didn't go to a zero.
},
{
    462.96,465.6
     Now if I did this again in an hour. Oh by George, it is down. Yeah. down to about a three. It didn't go to a zero. Now if I did this again in an hour.
},
{
    465.6,467.64
     Oh, by George, it is down.
},
{
    467.64,468.48
     Yeah.
},
{
    468.48,469.32
     Mine was at a three.
},
{
    469.32,470.76
     I'd say it's at a one now.
},
{
    470.76,472.16
     Yeah, so yours went down.
},
{
    473.16,474.36
     This just shocks me.
},
{
    474.36,475.56
     Mine is smaller.
},
{
    475.56,477.8
     Mine was about from here to here longer
},
{
    477.8,480.72
     and now it's reduced, but I'm still at a three.
},
{
    480.72,483.04
     I'd like to get this down to a one or zero.
},
{
    483.04,485.56
     It just shows you when there's that inherent tension
},
{
    485.56,488.62
     in the muscle, you know, there's not as much blood flow
},
{
    488.62,489.44
     to the area.
},
{
    489.44,493.16
     And so it just builds on it and it's cyclical
},
{
    493.16,494.36
     and makes it worse and worse.
},
{
    494.36,495.76
     Exactly right Bob.
},
{
    495.76,498.8
     So, you know, it's kind of changing my thinking
},
{
    498.8,499.64
     about some of the stuff.
},
{
    499.64,502.6
     I think some of the stuff, it's great to do stretches
},
{
    502.6,505.84
     at one time and then maybe do this at another time.
},
{
    505.84,508.76
     And you kind of get the best of both worlds then.
},
{
    508.76,510.56
     And you can go in here and finish up
},
{
    510.56,512.88
     with a little gentle massage.
},
{
    512.88,514.84
     And we've got some more information
},
{
    514.84,517.52
     on actually combining this technique
},
{
    517.52,519.96
     with a more aggressive massage, but that's another video.
},
{
    519.96,521.36
     Sure, we'll have to start doing that.
},
{
    521.36,522.68
     We continue to learn, so.
},
{
    522.68,523.84
     Yeah, we get smarter.
},
{
    523.84,525.56
     Yeah, well, I don't know.
},
{
    525.56,527.28
     The other people may not think so, but we do.
},
{
    527.28,529.88
     So thanks for watching, folks.
},
{
    529.88,None
     Be careful. you
