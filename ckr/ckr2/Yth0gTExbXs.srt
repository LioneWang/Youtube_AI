     In this quick video, I'm going to go over what is the sciatic nerve and give some really effective ways to treat sciatica without using risky drugs, injections, or surgery.

     good at treating back and sciatica pain.

    35.04,37.4
     of people find long-lasting relief.
},
{
    37.4,41.0
     So let's dive into what is the sciatic nerve?
},
{
    41.0,43.24
     Sciatic nerve pain affects millions of people.
},
{
    43.24,48.58
     The pain can range from minor nagging pain to a debilitating condition. Despite it being a common problem,
},
{
    48.58,52.94
     there's still a lot of confusion about what exactly is the sciatic nerve and how
},
{
    52.94,56.68
     to treat it. To help get you up to speed, here's what you need to know about both
},
{
    56.68,60.64
     the anatomy of your sciatic nerve and the pain associated with it. Your sciatic
},
{
    60.64,64.78
     nerve is the longest and largest nerve in your entire body. Its width can be that
},
{
    64.78,67.44
     of your finger at its widest point.
},
{
    67.44,72.32
     It begins as a bundle of nerve fibers, also called nerve roots, in your lower spine.
},
{
    72.32,77.0
     These nerve fibers exit through holes in the bones at the back of your spine.
},
{
    77.0,81.12
     The sciatic nerve travels through your pelvis and down the back of your leg.
},
{
    81.12,85.44
     When your sciatic nerve reaches your knee, it divides into two separate nerves, the tibial
},
{
    85.44,90.96
     nerve and the common perennial nerve. The perennial nerve travels sideways along the outer part of
},
{
    90.96,97.36
     your knee and then down to your upper foot. The tibial nerve travels downwards towards your heel
},
{
    97.36,102.4
     and the sole of your foot. So why does your sciatic nerve hurt so much? The first thing to know about
},
{
    102.4,105.88
     pain associated with your sciatic nerve is that sciatica is
},
{
    105.88,107.76
     not a medical diagnosis.
},
{
    107.76,112.6
     Rather, sciatica is a symptom of an underlying medical disorder.
},
{
    112.6,117.96
     Sciatica refers not only to symptoms of pain, but also to numbness and weakness felt along
},
{
    117.96,119.2
     your sciatic nerve.
},
{
    119.2,123.84
     The most common disorders that cause these symptoms may include degenerative disc disease,
},
{
    123.84,125.12
     a lumbar herniated
},
{
    125.12,128.52
     disc, spinal stenosis, and piriformis syndrome.
},
{
    128.52,132.48
     In a previous video, I went over the main causes of sciatica pain.

     and sometimes a combination of multiple treatment techniques.
},
{
    146.2,150.2
     A chiropractic adjustment is the most common treatment used to relieve irritation to the

{
    150.2,154.24
     sciatic nerve caused by misalignments in the spine or pelvis.
},
{
    154.24,157.6
     For my patients, I recommend using flexion distraction.
},
{
    157.6,162.4
     It's a hands-on, traction-based chiropractic adjustment that helps relieve sciatica without

{
    162.4,169.16
     the snap crack or popping sensations for more traditional style of chiropractic care. For more severe conditions such as
},
{
    169.16,174.16
     disc herniations, spinal stenosis, or advanced spinal degeneration, I use spinal

    174.16,178.12

     traction that helps relieve lower back and sciatica pain by taking pressure off
