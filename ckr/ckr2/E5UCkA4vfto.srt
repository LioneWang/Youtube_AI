     I can't tell you how many times one of my clients has walked into the gym clutching their shoulder

     claiming how they slept on their neck wrong. Or they went to reach for something in the back seat

     after trying this technique I'm about to share with you. All you need for this technique is a

{
    21.92,28.0
     lacrosse ball and a wall corner. If you don't have a lacrosse ball, you could also use a tennis ball.
},
{
    28.0,34.0
     Essentially, you're going to use this lacrosse ball to apply pressure to the area around your shoulder.
},
{
    34.0,37.0
     The front, top, side, and back.
},
{
    37.0,41.0
     This is going to help restore mobility to your shoulders and neck.

{
    41.0,43.0
     So let's get started.

    49.04,56.08
     Place the ball just below your clavicle bone right next to your arm pin. Then lean into the wall to apply pressure to the area. Let your arm hang comfortably at your

{
    56.08,76.0
     side with your palm open and your hand relaxed. Breathe calmly and hold on tender areas. Do this pec release for a minimum of 60 seconds before switching sides.
},
{
    76.0,81.0
     If you're having trouble getting enough direct pressure to this point, I recommend the following.
},
{
    81.0,97.84
     Try bringing your feet a little further apart and lowering your torso so you can leverage your body weight against the wall.
},
{
    97.84,102.64
     Place the ball on the top of your shoulder next to the base of your neck.
},
{
    102.64,106.24
     Get into a staggered stance and bend forward to apply pressure
},
{
    106.24,113.12
     against the wall corner. Hold on tender points and breathe in a relaxed manner. Do this traps

{
    113.12,123.6
     release for a minimum of 60 seconds before switching sides. If you're uncomfortable doing this from

    123.6,126.36
     the standing position, grab a cushion and try

{
    126.36,127.84
     doing it from your knees.
},
{
    127.84,143.32
     This should be a little easier for you.
},
{
    143.32,147.0
     Place the ball beneath your shoulder next to your armpit.
},
{
    147.0,152.78
     Apply pressure by leaning your side against the wall with the ball placed first.
},
{
    152.78,157.58
     Hold on tender spots and focus on breathing through any discomfort.
},
{
    157.58,167.0
     Do this lat's release for a minimum of 60 seconds before switching sides.
},
{
    167.0,172.12
     For best results, focus on the dense area just beside the armpit.
},
{
    172.12,194.2
     This is where you'll find some of those intense trigger points. Place the ball on your upper back in the space between your spine and your shoulder blade.
