},
{
    66.2,67.04
     Let's get on with this.
},
{
    67.04,68.32
     Let's get started with the show.
},
{
    68.32,69.16
     There you go.
},
{
    69.16,73.4
     Bob, as you and I know from back pain ourselves,
},
{
    73.4,75.8
     as well as hundreds or thousands of patients
},
{
    75.8,78.52
     over the last 20 and 30 years for us,
},
{
    78.52,81.4
     the first thing you wanna do is get them comfortable
},
{
    81.4,83.68
     and see if you can relax the muscles
},
{
    83.68,87.2
     and get that pain to come down very quickly.
},
{
    87.2,91.14
     And posture is one of the key issues with it.
},
{
    91.14,93.66
     And the next thing you can either apply some heat to it
},
{
    93.66,96.32
     or cold to it, depending on the situation.
},
{
    96.32,97.16
     Yeah, the whole thing,
},
{
    97.16,100.12
     and the reason our back is spasming,
},
{
    100.12,103.72
     it's trying to splint and support them
},
{
    103.72,105.18
     so you don't bend the back.
},
{
    105.18,108.44
     Right, it's a natural mechanism for the body
},
{
    108.44,109.38
     to protect itself.
},
{
    109.38,111.64
     Yeah, and it's usually trying to protect itself
},
{
    111.64,113.78
     from going into a bad position.
},
{
    113.78,116.4
     So a lot of times if you put it into a good position,
},
{
    116.4,117.82
     a lot of times that's gonna calm it down.
},
{
    117.82,119.56
     Sure, you bet.
},
{
    119.56,123.56
     So the first thing is also with this,
},
{
    123.56,125.0
     we're gonna talk about briefly
},
{
    125.08,128.98
     if you have pain going down the leg,
},
{
    128.98,130.24
     that's gonna change things.
},
{
    130.24,132.36
     For the most part, we're talking about that pain
},
{
    132.36,135.08
     that's in the back, it's central in the back,
},
{
    135.08,138.08
     maybe in the buttock a little bit.
},
{
    138.08,140.32
     But if you got pain running down the leg,
},
{
    140.32,142.28
     that puts it in a different category.
},
{
    142.28,144.2
     That's more sciatica and you should probably check out
},
{
    144.2,145.56
     some of our sciatica videos.
},
{
    145.56,146.9
     There you go.
},
{
    146.9,150.2
     So the first thing is find a position
},
{
    150.2,151.84
     that you can get it to relax.
},
{
    151.84,154.56
     And if you can do this either in a seated chair,
},
{
    154.56,156.88
     depending on the chair or laying down,
},
{
    156.88,159.44
     we're gonna cover all three of those positions.
},
{
    159.44,162.2
     So if you're in a chair, now personally,
},
{
    162.2,168.04
     what I do is I use a recliner and my recliner obviously reclines,
},
{
    168.04,171.84
     but I absolutely must have lumbar support
},
{
    171.84,174.96
     because most furniture and recliners
},
{
    174.96,177.16
     do not have enough lumbar support right in here.
},
{
    177.16,179.16
     When you're sinking in and you're going into
},
{
    179.16,181.88
     that rounded out position and generally,
},
{
    181.88,183.88
     with most people the rounded out position,
},
{
    183.88,190.02
     that slumped position is the one that may be causing your pain. So we want to get you. I got a shom on here
},
{
    190.02,195.3
     Oh go ahead Bob show him the anatomy again. So the bones are the strongest
},
{
    195.3,202.38
     This is the vertebrae is standing up just like Brad right now facing this way and generally the back is the strongest
},
{
    202.38,205.96
     When you have a slight curve in slight slight curve out, slight curve in.
},
{
    206.0,208.8
     So the more you can get your spine in that position,
},
{
    209.32,214.04
     generally the better it's going to be and the less pain it's going to have. The bad position generally is this.
},
{
    214.04,216.04
     Right. That's slow.
},
{
    216.04,218.04
     So if you're in a recliner that's
},
{
    218.88,224.0
     that soft and you're sinking in like this, you're going to be in that rounded out position.
},
{
    224.0,227.68
     You want to be in that rounded out position. You wanna be in that S curve.
},
{
    227.68,230.2
     And that's why you use a lumbar support.
},
{
    230.2,232.04
     And also by reclining,
},
{
    232.04,234.0
     you're actually taking some of the weight off the spine.
},
{
    234.0,234.84
     Yeah, so.
},
{
    234.84,235.8
     Exactly.
},
{
    235.8,239.36
     So you can use a tall roll like this
},
{
    239.36,241.92
     for that lumbar support right in here.
},
{
    241.92,243.2
     You can use a throw pillow.
},
{
    243.2,244.56
     I have a lot of my patients have that.
},
{
    244.56,246.4
     That's what I use as a throw pillow all the time.
},
{
    246.4,248.32
     If it's not too big or the size is right.
},
{
    248.32,250.96
     Typically a head pillow gets too big,
},
{
    250.96,253.8
     but sometimes I've had people had success with those.
},
{
    253.8,256.08
     You can purchase lumbar supports
},
{
    256.08,257.92
     like this is a memory foam one.
},
{
    257.92,259.96
     But what I'm gonna say then,
},
{
    259.96,261.68
     when you get that position
},
{
    261.68,268.24
     and you find the back pain is relieving, then depending on what you respond better to,
},
{
    268.48,272.32
     you may know already if you use a cold pack or a hot pack.
},
{
    273.84,275.96
     You've been using, well you use both, don't you Brad?
},
{
    275.96,280.18
     I do, if I have a real severe back pain
},
{
    280.18,282.32
     and it just happened because I did something silly,
},
{
    282.32,284.88
     like I was out working too hard and bending and lifting
},
{
    284.88,286.34
     and I knew I shouldn't have been doing it.
},
{
    286.34,287.68
     Then I'll use a cold pack,
},
{
    287.68,290.44
     but if I just got tight muscles and they're spasming
},
{
    290.44,291.86
     and it just feel tight,
},
{
    291.86,293.96
     then I'm gonna go to a hot pack.
},
{
    293.96,295.0
     Okay.
},
{
    295.0,296.36
     And when I do use hot packs,
},
{
    296.36,298.48
     what I use is the Thermotex.
},
{
    298.48,299.32
     Yeah.
},
{
    299.32,300.68
     Thermotex is infrared heat.
},
{
    300.68,301.52
     Right.
},
{
    301.52,303.96
     Or infrared rays, I don't know what you'd call them.
},
{
    303.96,306.04
     But the reason why we like the Thermotex
},
{
    306.04,307.2
     and Brad and I both use this,
},
{
    307.2,309.6
     I just have it in my chair every night,
},
{
    309.6,311.72
     especially when it's cold like this now,
},
{
    311.72,316.08
     27 below in my area, 29 below in your area this morning.
},
{
    316.08,318.4
     Whatever, it's freezing water pretty quick.
},
{
    318.4,320.08
     I actually sat on mine this morning.
},
{
    320.08,322.92
     I did, we're having our floors done,
},
{
    322.92,325.76
     so I had to eat my cereal, watch it, TV,
},
{
    325.76,328.28
     and I put the thermotex on even for that little bit.
},
{
    328.28,330.28
     So you can actually even leave it on.
},
{
    330.28,333.76
     But the reason why we like the thermotex over regular heat,
},
{
    333.76,335.8
     I'm just gonna show you this demonstration real quick.
},
{
    335.8,339.56
     Regular heat only penetrates a minimal amount here,
},
{
    339.56,341.32
     just like a millimeter or two.
},
{
    341.32,342.68
     And when he says regular heat,
},
{
    342.68,347.24
     that's a standard hot pack, a convection hot pack technically,
},
{
    347.24,349.92
     and it just heats up by contact.
},
{
    349.92,353.44
     Infrared is sending out the infrared rays
},
{
    353.44,355.4
     that are like the sun puts out,
},
{
    355.4,356.76
     and it goes much deeper.
},
{
    356.76,358.92
     It goes much deeper, 2.36?
},
{
    358.92,359.92
     2.36.
},
{
    359.92,361.4
     2.36 inches.
},
{
    361.4,364.48
     And so you can see that penetrates down,
},
{
    364.48,366.04
     that's starting to get into the spine.
},
{
    366.04,368.32
     So into the joints of the spine.
},
{
    368.32,369.92
     The muscles in your back, you know,
},
{
    369.92,373.52
     you've got some fairly thick muscles, bands of muscles.
},
{
    373.52,375.72
     So that's why we use that.
},
{
    375.72,376.56
     Now the key is-
},
{
    376.56,377.96
     The wrap and the knuckles like the old nuns.
},
{
    377.96,381.0
     Bob, why, Bob, why, once again.
},
{
    381.0,384.84
     Anyways, seriously, take your hot pack,
},
{
    384.84,387.08
     whatever you're using, hot pack or cold pack,
},
{
    387.08,389.94
     and put it back and use that physically
},
{
    389.94,391.76
     as part of the lumbar support.
},
{
    391.76,394.88
     So that is giving the physical comfort
},
{
    394.88,396.36
     and then you add in the heat.
},
{
    396.36,399.16
     So you have this and then you'd have the thermotex
},
{
    399.16,401.72
     over the top of it or this and the cold pack
},
{
    401.72,402.56
     over the top.
},
{
    402.56,404.96
     Right, as a matter of fact, I actually just use this
},
{
    404.96,406.4
     because it offers enough support.
},
{
    406.4,408.16
     It's enough lumbar support for him.
},
{
    408.16,410.04
     Yeah, and I don't need to have the,
},
{
    410.04,412.24
     the, there's the cold pack.
},
{
    412.24,413.08
     The cushion.
},
{
    413.08,415.08
     If you're using the cold pack,
},
{
    415.08,418.8
     you definitely need a cold pack that doesn't freeze hard.
},
{
    418.8,421.84
     When it comes out of the freezer, it needs to be pliable.
},
{
    421.84,424.12
     And do not put it directly on your skin.
},
{
    424.12,426.16
     Make sure you have at least a layer of clothing.
},
{
    426.16,428.48
     We actually have a video on how to make a cold pack.
},
{
    428.48,429.32
     Yep.
},
{
    429.32,430.16
     Very inexpensive.
},
{
    430.16,433.24
     If you want to just look up Bob and Brad cold pack.
},
{
    433.24,434.08
     Yep.
},
{
    434.08,435.52
     And it's just, you know, rubbing alcohol
},
{
    435.52,437.84
     and some freezer bags and some tap water.
},
{
    437.84,438.68
     Yeah.
},
{
    438.68,441.32
     This time of year when it was 29 below,
},
{
    441.32,443.12
     I didn't even want to put this on my back right now.
},
{
    443.12,444.84
     But I'm good, I'm going to sacrifice it
},
{
    444.84,446.16
     for the viewers.
},
{
    446.16,447.28
     Thank you for that million.
},
{
    447.28,450.16
     I'm gonna enjoy this cold back right now.
},
{
    450.16,451.0
     There you go.
},
{
    451.0,451.84
     There you go.
},
{
    451.84,453.56
     Now, and that's in the seated position.
},
{
    453.56,457.04
     Oftentimes people can find better relief laying down.
},
{
    457.04,457.88
     Right.
},
{
    458.92,461.04
     So we're gonna show you a few tricks
},
{
    461.04,462.76
     that we've learned over the years.
},
{
    463.68,464.98
     Now in your bed,
},
{
    466.08,467.36
     you can take pillows.
},
{
    467.36,469.28
     Yeah, here show them the pillow trick, Bob.
},
{
    469.28,471.88
     Yeah, you can show pillows and put them underneath the-
},
{
    471.88,473.8
     I had that other pillow here for you.
},
{
    473.8,475.84
     Yeah, you need quite a few, that's the thing.
},
{
    475.84,478.52
     For my head, Bob, I want a pillow for my head.
},
{
    478.52,479.76
     Okay.
},
{
    479.76,481.36
     There, there, oh, thank you.
},
{
    481.36,482.2
     All right.
},
{
    482.2,485.56
     So this will typically be better than nothing,
},
{
    485.56,488.32
     but we've found that this leg wedge
},
{
    488.32,491.04
     does a tremendous job of relieving pressure.
},
{
    491.04,493.48
     I can't tell you how many times I've used this field.
},
{
    493.48,495.16
     People just love it.
},
{
    495.16,498.32
     The other thing, this is totally off on a different story,
},
{
    498.32,501.64
     but tangent, but I have a patient who's got
},
{
    501.64,504.4
     lymphedema in his legs, and this just works so well
},
{
    504.4,505.1
     to put his legs up
},
{
    505.1,506.9
     and then he does his ankle pumps like this.
},
{
    506.9,508.74
     This pumps that fluid right out of there.
},
{
    508.74,511.74
     I've had this work for knee pain, hip pain, back pain,
},
{
    511.74,512.78
     the whole works.
},
{
    512.78,516.58
     And then you take your hot pack,
},
{
    516.58,517.86
     you know, you put it under there first,
},
{
    517.86,519.86
     you don't have to go through this gyration,
},
{
    519.86,520.7
     especially when you got a-
},
{
    520.7,521.54
     No, you're getting your-
},
{
    521.54,522.38
     A mic wire.
},
{
    522.38,523.22
     You're getting your mic wire there.
},
{
    523.22,524.46
     You're probably not gonna have a mic wire
},
{
    524.46,525.92
     when you're at home.
},
{
    525.92,528.0
     And then your cold pack can go under there
},
{
    528.0,530.2
     or your hot pack.
},
{
    530.2,531.36
     You want to be a little careful
},
{
    531.36,533.4
     if you're laying on a hot pack
},
{
    533.4,536.56
     because it can get burned.
},
{
    536.56,538.28
     I mean, because you're compressing,
},
{
    538.28,539.84
     there's not as much blood flow there.
},
{
    539.84,543.36
     Thermotex less likely because of that radiant heat.
},
{
    543.36,545.58
     It just doesn't, I mean that infrared heat.
},
{
    545.58,547.76
     It's not as intense.
},
{
    547.76,548.8
     There's only one level.
},
{
    548.8,551.68
     It's not like the convection where you have three levels.
},
{
    551.68,553.3
     And if you fall asleep on this,
},
{
    553.3,554.64
     you don't want to fall asleep on either.
},
{
    554.64,556.72
     No, not fall asleep on either one.
},
{
    556.72,558.92
     They recommend 45 minutes on the infrared
},
{
    558.92,562.24
     because it goes much deeper on the convection,
},
{
    562.24,564.68
     typically 20 to 30 minutes maximum.
},
{
    565.46,568.9
     Cold packs, you can fall asleep with a cold pack
},
{
    568.9,571.12
     because they just warm up.
},
{
    571.12,572.2
     Yeah, they tend to warm up.
},
{
    572.2,574.06
     Right, so it's not, you know, again,
},
{
    574.06,575.66
     not directly on your skin.
},
{
    578.54,580.68
     Generally, I mean, you want a cold pack
},
{
    580.68,582.72
     for about 20 minutes anyway, and by that,
},
{
    582.72,584.04
     it's warming up anyway.
},
{
    584.04,586.32
     I have fallen asleep with a cold pack. Yeah, and anyway. And by that, it's warming up anyway. I have fallen asleep with a cold pack.
},
{
    586.32,588.64
     Yep, and then in bed I've done it.
},
{
    588.64,590.16
     I just take it out, put it on the floor
},
{
    590.16,592.24
     the next morning, throw it in the freezer again.
},
{
    592.24,594.04
     This is the cycle, Bob.
},
{
    594.04,595.44
     The world is a cycle.
},
{
    595.44,596.44
     Cycle and weight.
},
{
    596.44,598.52
     I'll learn how to manage your back pain sometimes,
},
{
    598.52,601.2
     especially if you've got kind of a chronic situation.
},
{
    601.2,605.32
     So the other point, Brad, you can actually try laying down
},
{
    605.32,606.16
     that I have the pillow.
},
{
    606.16,607.56
     Oh yeah.
},
{
    607.56,610.44
     You know, I used to have success with laying on my stomach
},
{
    610.44,614.84
     years ago, and then as my spondylolisthesis progressed,
},
{
    614.84,615.88
     it's the worst thing I could do.
},
{
    615.88,617.76
     Yeah, it would not be good for spondylolisthesis,
},
{
    617.76,619.58
     but for a lot of back issues,
},
{
    619.58,621.64
     this actually is gonna feel good.
},
{
    621.64,623.76
     You can start with a couple pillows like this,
},
{
    623.76,625.02
     and just lay down like this
},
{
    625.02,626.5
     and then you can have another pillow here.
},
{
    626.5,628.94
     And just work your way.
},
{
    628.94,630.58
     And then I'm gonna put the cold pack on you
},
{
    630.58,631.42
     so you get the help stuff for that.
},
{
    631.42,632.26
     Thanks for that today.
},
{
    632.26,634.54
     Oh, appreciate that Brad.
},
{
    634.54,635.82
     Oh, that wakes me up.
},
{
    635.82,636.66
     There you go.
},
{
    636.66,639.26
     But eventually you can go work your way to the point
},
{
    639.26,640.9
     where you take maybe one pillow out
},
{
    641.82,644.22
     and then lay like that for a bit
},
{
    644.22,645.84
     and then you actually can take another pillow out and then you know lay like that for a bit and then you actually can take another pillow out
},
{
    646.56,652.48
     and lay like that and even on just regular old you know typical back pain after a while you might
},
{
    652.48,658.88
     even lay like this on the prone part we call it and it starts moving the back into that arch position
},
{
    658.88,668.04
     and a lot of times that helps calm things down and along that, you can put the hot pack, leave it on there while you're doing this,
},
{
    668.04,670.6
     as well as the cold pack,
},
{
    670.6,673.2
     whichever you respond better to.
},
{
    673.2,674.84
     You know, that's a big question, Bob.
},
{
    674.84,677.84
     People say, do I use heat or do I use cold?
},
{
    677.84,681.04
     And I've had people that don't respond
},
{
    681.04,682.76
     while it's cold no matter what.
},
{
    682.76,683.92
     Exactly.
},
{
    683.92,684.76
     And then on the other hand-
},
{
    684.76,685.44
     There's arthritis in there,
},
{
    685.44,691.44
     arthritis, the cold doesn't feel good. But one way or another, if it is an acute really sore and
},
{
    691.44,696.96
     tender to the touch where it's like, oh, it feels like it's all swollen, that's when I'm gonna say
},
{
    696.96,702.32
     back off on the heat, lean towards the cold. Yeah, especially for the first like 24 to 36 hours.
},
{
    702.32,706.52
     Right. Because there's swelling in your back, just like if you injure a joint,
},
{
    706.52,707.82
     you sprain your ankle,
},
{
    707.82,710.0
     you can definitely get swelling in your back too.
},
{
    710.0,712.4
     So, alright, well I hope we covered it.
},
{
    712.4,714.6
     And remember Brad and I can fix just about anything.
},
{
    714.6,716.4
     Except for a broken heart.
},
{
    716.4,717.6
     But we're working on that.
},
{
    717.6,718.44
     Yeah.
},
{
    718.44,721.08
     If you've ever, I ask you, do you ever break a heart?
},
{
    721.08,724.48
     Bob, Bob, how can you ask me those things?
},
{
    724.48,725.0
     This is, we don't do things from the neck out here. Thanks for watching. Breaking heart? Bob, Bob, how can you ask me those things?
},
{
    725.0,727.0
     We don't do things from the neck out here.
},
