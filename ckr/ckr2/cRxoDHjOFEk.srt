     Good day revivers. I'm Dr. Lin at Rehab and Revive Physical Therapy.
},
{
    4.38,9.6
     We're excited to have you back on our channel for another episode for a back exercise.
},
{
    10.2,16.14
     We've enjoyed a lot of great success with our back spasm video that we launched a couple months ago and
},
{
    16.62,21.9
     good timing because a lot of people are getting hurt around this COVID time working from home,
},
{
    22.2,26.64
     sitting in their desks, not doing so well, and hurting themselves.
},
{
    26.64,32.16
     And also even worse, some people have been commenting and saying that they've been getting
},
{
    32.16,37.84
     numbness and tingling that's stemming from their backs and going down their legs. And that's a
},
{
    37.84,45.0
     bad thing. We've got a great exercise coming up to help reduce those symptoms and improve your life.
},
{
    45.0,55.0
     Music
},
{
    55.0,61.0
     So, most of us have been sitting at home on our poor workstations during this COVID time.
},
{
    61.0,67.28
     Sitting in bad postures, bar stools, kitchen tables, and the list goes on.
},
{
    67.28,70.52
     So what is this happening and what's going on
},
{
    70.52,72.76
     that's creating this numbness and tingling
},
{
    72.76,74.3
     that can go down your leg?
},
{
    74.3,76.5
     Let's explain this a little bit further.
},
{
    76.5,80.0
     Well, the signals that go down your leg
},
{
    80.0,83.36
     come and stem from your lumbar spine.
},
{
    83.36,84.8
     What happens then is usually
},
{
    84.8,85.16
     because if you're in a slosh position, come and stem from your lumbar spine. What happens then is usually because
},
{
    85.16,86.84
     if you're in a slush position,
},
{
    86.84,90.62
     you have a little protrusion of that vertebral disc
},
{
    90.62,93.98
     that can then push into the nerves.
},
{
    93.98,96.24
     Now, vertebral disc, if it herniates,
},
{
    96.24,100.0
     the material gets very toxic and the nerve gets angry.
},
{
    100.0,100.84
     Well, guess what?
},
{
    100.84,102.52
     The nerve also goes all the way down
},
{
    102.52,104.72
     and gives signals all the way down to your feet.
},
{
    104.72,107.56
     And when that gets compressed, angry,
},
{
    107.56,110.86
     and then almost choked off or suffocated,
},
{
    110.86,113.2
     these nerves start sending you the signal
},
{
    113.2,115.6
     of numbness and tingling and pain.
},
{
    115.6,119.52
     So we've got a great exercise that's coming up
},
{
    119.52,121.2
     and it's called the prone press up.
},
{
    121.2,124.14
     It was originally developed by Dr. Robin McKenzie.
},
{
    124.14,128.4
     So I want to give him credit that, know it's a great exercise. But we've made a
},
{
    128.4,133.12
     few tweaks and modifications in our time now, so stay tuned and we're gonna help
},
{
    133.12,138.4
     those symptoms. Alright so we're back and this is how you set it up to be safe.
},
{
    138.4,143.08
     This is a very important exercise because it could be provocative and can
},
{
    143.08,147.26
     hurt you. So put a pillow underneath your belly at step one.
},
{
    147.26,150.84
     Also, the modification we've made here at Rehab and Revive
},
{
    150.84,153.68
     is to take your feet, you're gonna place that
},
{
    153.68,155.0
     and pin it down.
},
{
    155.0,157.52
     What that does is it attractions a little bit
},
{
    157.52,160.76
     of your spine towards the back wall.
},
{
    160.76,164.04
     So once again, I hit that, I push down a little bit
},
{
    164.04,167.74
     and just like people do in yoga chaturanga
},
{
    167.74,170.98
     This was great helps that lengthen that spine a little bit more
},
{
    171.2,175.24
     So now we're gonna start flat on your stomach and before I do it
},
{
    175.84,179.6
     You want to be flat and you want to work it in slowly?
},
{
    179.6,185.28
     You want to ease into it slowly if you feel like a brick or a ball or not, you don't want to
},
{
    185.28,190.36
     work past it. You want to go slowly, ease into it until it melts and then you can get
},
{
    190.36,196.24
     into the next level. And eventually I'm going to be on my hands fully extended with my elbows.
},
{
    196.24,201.22
     So we want to do it super slow until your body is ready to let go. Once again, when
},
{
    201.22,206.6
     your body is ready to let go, then you can progress to the next height
},
{
    206.6,208.18
     or to the next pressure.
},
{
    208.18,240.32
     So here's the Pram Press Up here at Rehab and Revive. So when you get closer, you can move it in.
},
{
    240.32,260.0
     Move your elbows in.
},
{
    265.28,270.64
     And as you can see, I'm slowly able to just let my body ease into extension.
},
{
    276.64,283.04
     And like I said, as I get closer, I can move my elbows in and that helps me prop myself up easier.
},
{
    286.44,289.32
     Now I'm ready to get to the next level, start extending my elbows. So you don't want to get too far into it.
},
{
    289.32,292.12
     A lot of people go past their limit.
},
{
    292.12,307.0
     So now I move my hands in and I start going up. lower spine.
},
{
    317.0,324.0
     Once again I can get in a little bit more.
},
{
    324.7,325.0
     There we go.
},
{
    325.0,329.0
     Now the whole thing at the end is this.
},
{
    329.0,334.52
     So you can just work into it, work out of it, work into it, work out of it, work into
},
{
    334.52,337.28
     it, and work out of it.
},
{
    337.28,338.72
     Now that's the top goal.
},
{
    338.72,341.16
     Once you're done, you're done with the exercise.
},
{
    341.16,342.44
     Lower yourself slowly.
},
{
    342.44,346.4
     Not a mistake. So I want to be serious here and
},
{
    346.4,352.12
     preface that this exercise is a powerful exercise and is also a dangerous
},
{
    352.12,356.44
     exercise. If your symptoms aren't improving that numbness and teaming or
},
{
    356.44,360.76
     it's getting worse and you're being more numb, this isn't the right exercise for
},
{
    360.76,366.02
     you. Go to a healthcare professional, get it checked out because you could be making it worse
},
{
    367.08,372.26
     The reason this exercise is great for people that have a little bit of a disc problem
},
{
    372.44,376.96
     So we're really trying to wiggle out the nerve and push the and create more space
