    0.0,19.3
     Now let's cover child CPR.
},
{
    19.3,22.8
     A few things we should be thinking about when we're talking about child CPR.
},
{
    22.8,25.04
     The guidelines help us understand the child
},
{
    25.04,33.28
     range is between year one and their first signs of puberty. There is this age just like 14, but you
},
{
    33.28,38.64
     know there's a lot of ambiguity between when does a child become an adult and when is an adult the
},
{
    38.64,47.08
     size of a child. I personally like to go by the size of the patient. And in this case, he is clearly somewhere
},
{
    47.08,49.48
     between the ages of one and 12,
},
{
    49.48,52.16
     which is well within our safety range of a child.
},
{
    52.16,55.92
     And we're gonna use that as our guideline for doing CPR.
},
{
    55.92,58.16
     Secondly, when we do the depth of the compression
},
{
    58.16,62.42
     on a child, it's one third the depth of the chest.
},
{
    62.42,64.12
     So just something to keep in mind here
},
{
    64.12,65.12
     as we're doing CPR
},
{
    65.12,70.16
     for the child. Now in this situation we had a player on the soccer field and they
},
{
    70.16,75.2
     suddenly collapsed. We don't know why. And so we're going to assess them but we
},
{
    75.2,79.28
     also need to think about where they electrocuted. They step on a bare
},
{
    79.28,83.36
     wire. Was there a snake? I mean who knows? We're just gonna look for anything. So
},
{
    83.36,85.0
     insure scene is safe.
},
{
    85.0,88.4
     My gloves are on, my CPR shield is available,
},
{
    88.4,91.0
     so now I'm safe to rescue.
},
{
    91.0,93.28
     Now we're also gonna be talking about
},
{
    93.28,95.36
     what the first step is.
},
{
    95.36,97.0
     Hand on the forehead to remind me
},
{
    97.0,99.32
     not to move their head or neck excessively
},
{
    99.32,101.2
     as I tap on the collarbone.
},
{
    101.2,102.36
     Hey buddy, are you all right?
},
{
    102.36,103.58
     Are you okay?
},
{
    103.58,106.16
     This player does not respond.
},
{
    106.16,108.84
     Once there is no response to my taps and shouts,
},
{
    108.84,111.84
     and I notice that they are not breathing normally,
},
{
    111.84,114.52
     it's automatically gonna be a 911 call.
},
{
    114.52,116.86
     You in the plaid shirt, go call 911 and come back.
},
{
    116.86,117.7
     I might need your help.
},
{
    117.7,120.52
     And if you could find an AED, bring an AED with you.
},
{
    120.52,124.2
     If I don't have anybody to go call 911 or get an AED,
},
{
    124.2,126.36
     I'm gonna dial 911 on my cell phone
},
{
    126.36,131.32
     and I'm going to put it on speakerphone so that dispatchers can help coach me through this scene.
},
{
    131.32,136.8
     Now we get right into our action. I'm going to place in this case for the size of the patient
},
{
    136.8,144.2
     one palm of one hand. If this was a large child or at the upper end of the child becoming an adult,
},
{
    144.2,145.04
     we would treat them as an adult, we would
},
{
    145.04,149.72
     treat them as an adult with two hand CPR. But this child is adequate with one.
},
{
    149.72,154.4
     I'm going to place the palm of my hand on the center of his chest on the lower
},
{
    154.4,158.44
     third of his sternum between the breasts. I'm now going to start my
},
{
    158.44,163.4
     compressions to one third the depth of the chest in depth and at a rate of
},
{
    163.4,166.4
     between a hundred and a hundred and 120 times per minute.
},
{
    166.4,168.06
     That's at least two a second.
},
{
    168.06,169.32
     Here we go.
},
{
    169.32,172.64
     One and two and three and four and five and six and seven
},
{
    172.64,177.52
     and eight and nine and 10, 11 and 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
},
{
    177.52,182.52
     18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.
},
{
    184.2,186.84
     I'm gonna now give a head tilt chin lift,
},
{
    186.84,189.24
     get my mask and shield with the one-way valve,
},
{
    189.24,191.96
     pinch the nose, and open the mouth.
},
{
    191.96,194.04
     I'm gonna give my two rescue breaths.
},
{
    198.84,200.52
     Two rescue breaths go in,
},
{
    200.52,202.62
     I go back into my compressions.
},
{
    202.62,204.84
     One and two and three and four and five,
},
{
    204.84,210.96
     26, 27, 28, 29, 30. I now give my two more rescue breaths and I'm going to do this 30
},
{
    210.96,218.48
     compression to two rescue breaths until help arrives, EMS arrives, and AED arrives, or my
},
{
    218.48,222.08
     patient actually revives, starts breathing and moving on their own.
},
