     Bob and Brad the two most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    9.52,13.04
     Hi folks I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist Brad Heineck physical therapist because we
},
{
    13.04,16.96
     are the most famous physical therapists on the internet in our opinion of course Bob
},
{
    16.96,23.04
     Brad today Mr. Heineck you want to talk about is your neck or shoulder pain coming from a pinched
},
{
    23.04,25.12
     nerve or is it actually from muscle?
},
{
    25.12,28.36
     Right, it's a common question and it's a very valid question
},
{
    28.36,31.92
     And it's what we do as therapists all the time
},
{
    31.92,38.96
     We need to determine is it from the nerve being pinched in the neck the spine or is the muscle just contracting and knotting up from
},
{
    39.44,42.8
     The activity that you're maybe doing so you got to get to the bottom of it
},
{
    42.8,43.36
     That's right
},
{
    43.36,46.12
     If you treat the muscle and it's a nerve you're wasting your time
},
{
    46.12,49.6
     Right and there's different ways to treat the two so that's why and we'll do those at the end
},
{
    49.6,52.96
     We'll show just some basic treatments, there you go, by the way if you're new to our channel

     Art tree acupressure
},
{
    78.56,82.08
     Matt and pillow it took a little bit for me to get out. Yeah, that's a tough one here we go
},
{
    82.08,85.28
     So bit for me to get out. Yeah, that's a tough one. Here we go. So our tree company is giving away
},
{
    85.28,89.52
     five of these so you just go in and there's a little sign-up thing and you're in the contest.
},
{
    89.52,96.0
     There you go. Let's get to the main menu, Bob. All right, let's go. Okay, so turn around once, Bob.
},
{
    96.0,100.8
     Bob comes in, he's a patient, he says, oh I got pain here and here and it's down one side and
},
{
    100.8,107.68
     it's over here and it's all tightened up and it's at work and he's on the computer he's getting so bad he's getting headaches and everything
},
{
    107.68,112.42
     else how are we gonna treat it so I'm thinking we got a we like we discussed
},
{
    112.42,116.2
     is it a nerve or is it the muscle itself so the first thing I want to do is
},
{
    116.2,120.88
     screen out is it a nerve and these are things you can do at home and you'll
},
{
    120.88,128.18
     find out very quickly what we have here. So the first thing is location. I get specifics on the location
},
{
    128.18,137.36
     If Bob says oh, it's here and it's painful here and he also gets some symptoms being pain numbness tingling down below the elbow
},
{
    137.96,144.06
     It's pretty much more likely nerve. Nerves getting pinched somewhere. Yeah, if the pain or symptoms
},
{
    144.06,147.68
     That means numbness tingling, anything unusual goes down below the
},
{
    147.68,155.68
     elbow almost certainly a nerve. So that makes it easy if you have that location. That's the simple one. If it stays up in here
},
{
    156.04,163.4
     Then it could go either way. It just might be a nerve that's not bad enough. Exactly. You can turn around once Bob.
},
{
    165.26,168.4
     Nerve that's not bad enough. Exactly. You can turn around once Bob. Now face them So this is what I'll do. Bob and I screen a little bit differently
},
{
    168.4,174.84
     But one thing you can do is a gentle test. There's a spurling test. A spurling test where you turn and go back like this
},
{
    174.84,179.82
     Right do that again. So slight turn to the right. Turn to the right and then you bend back a little bit
},
{
    179.82,192.36
     And that's assuming the pain is on this on the right side and then some gentle pressure And if that increases the pain and symptoms over here or sends some down the arm, it's pretty sure it's somewhere
},
{
    192.84,194.84
     He's putting more pressure on a nerve
},
{
    194.84,201.0
     Exactly, and you can do it on the other side too turn and go back and then gentle pressure
},
{
    202.8,205.68
     The other one this is kind of a screen that's not real
},
{
    205.68,209.0
     specific but I use it and with an experience I feel pretty comfortable
},
{
    209.0,216.68
     but as lay people it'll be helpful. I asked the person just look
},
{
    216.68,220.16
     back up and usually I have them in a chair where there's a backrest so you
},
{
    220.16,224.48
     can lean into that and be more relaxed. Now if Bob gets halfway back and all
},
{
    224.48,225.84
     this is ow it hurts, hurts back and all of this is out,
},
{
    225.84,229.04
     it hurts, hurts back in here or down the arm,
},
{
    229.04,230.28
     anything that goes down in the arm,
},
{
    230.28,232.56
     you're pretty much certain it's a nerve.
},
{
    232.56,234.4
     If you get stuck halfway back and says,
},
{
    234.4,236.72
     oh, that really is uncomfortable
},
{
    236.72,237.8
     and I don't wanna go any farther
},
{
    237.8,239.76
     because normally go back in normal range of motion
},
{
    239.76,242.04
     all the way, because that's what you would expect.
},
{
    242.04,243.98
     If they go back all the way like that
},
{
    243.98,245.26
     and there's no symptoms at all
},
{
    245.88,251.16
     Lessons, yeah, then you're starting thinking it's not coming from the neck and maybe it is just the muscles exactly
},
{
    251.16,253.16
     Postural thing, exactly
},
{
    253.42,258.32
     So what I do want to do is just spend just a brief second here to show you
},
{
    258.84,261.8
     What's going on and where the nerve? Oh, thanks you Bob
},
{
    262.36,266.7
     Here's the spine and here's the first seven vertebrae are the neck you got that
},
{
    267.52,269.52
     Julie's here, she's helping out
},
{
    269.52,275.7
     Julie, yes, so and these yellow things coming out are the spinal nerves
},
{
    276.26,280.4
     Okay, and they actually don't get cut off like this they go all the way down into the arm
},
{
    281.0,285.22
     Exactly, and you can see where they go and you got that in Julie
},
{
    285.38,287.36
     There's not a real large area
},
{
    287.36,293.46
     It's called a frame in where that nerve goes in at every level and it's usually the lower ones that get pinched
},
{
    293.46,297.36
     But it could be a number of reasons why that nerve gets pinched and send pain
},
{
    297.36,300.42
     We're not gonna get into that. It could be arthritis could be just inflammation
},
{
    300.5,304.26
     Right it could be stenosis could be a disc problem. So okay
},
{
    307.04,310.96
     inflammation. It could be stenosis, it could be a disc problem. So okay so once you go through those screens if everything is negative you don't get any symptoms down the arm, you can bring your
},
{
    310.96,315.76
     head all the way back, your range of motion is reasonably good in the neck. It's probably a muscle
},
{
    315.76,321.76
     problem and in Bob's case he already told me, I'm just doing a mock thing here, he already told me that
},
{
    321.76,325.8
     I'm at work, I'm at the computer and it gets so tight back here
},
{
    325.8,329.62
     And of course he's busy at work a lot of stress going on to get things done no breaks
},
{
    329.62,334.64
     Yeah, and then the next thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna palpate or feel the muscles in the upper traps
},
{
    334.64,340.96
     And I do that and they're just tighter than tight and painful pray and I'll find a trigger point in there here
},
{
    340.96,344.06
     And there that really kind of opens his eyes up and say oh, that's tight. Yeah
},
{
    343.78,351.32
     trigger point in there here and there that really kind of opens the eyes up and say oh that's tight Yeah, yeah, those are all things that are saying you know we're looking at muscle here exactly okay, so
},
{
    351.72,359.04
     Wide of muscles create so much pain just from either and this is what Bob and I were just talking about this before
},
{
    359.8,364.24
     Most of the time if you're at a computer you're sitting and you got pain back in here
},
{
    364.24,370.98
     It's likely a posture problem, right exactly and it's a head most muscle issues are posture
},
{
    370.98,376.42
     Yeah exactly and head forward posture very common there you go
},
{
    376.86,378.86
     Bob why don't you come over here? Sure
},
{
    380.34,381.54
     Now
},
{
    381.54,383.54
     Put your head forward Bob
},
{
    383.74,386.76
     There you go now. This is how Bob's looking, give him a
},
{
    386.76,390.8
     profile of it, there we go and I'll go back that way. So what's going on is
},
{
    390.8,394.16
     Bob's head's hanging there over nowhere and these muscles back here have to
},
{
    394.16,398.32
     contract. This represents the upper trap muscle and that's not the only one
},
{
    398.32,403.24
     working here. There's scalenes, there's other muscles, but we're going to focus on one muscle.
},
{
    403.24,407.5
     If this muscle upper trap is working more to help keep his head from falling down
},
{
    407.5,409.8
     Go ahead because you can't work with your head fall down
},
{
    409.8,415.1
     So the muscles keep it up and these muscles are postural muscles. They're made for holding on in
},
{
    416.08,420.34
     postures for long periods of time, but not really long. We're not talking hours
},
{
    420.34,424.44
     We're talking about 20 minutes and then the muscle should get a break and allow it to relax
},
{
    424.88,430.08
     hours we're talking about 20 minutes and then the muscle should get a break and allow it to relax. So we're going to take a look at this muscle and talk about why this muscle right back in here gets
},
{
    430.08,436.64
     so tight and painful. Again, a pastoral muscle is a big broad muscle, a lot of surface area, so
},
{
    436.64,442.08
     there's a lot of area for blood and capillaries to go into it. So the muscle has to have blood,
},
{
    442.08,449.88
     oxygen, nutrients in order for it to function. just like on here. This is the basic function of the muscle. This represents a muscle
},
{
    450.12,455.24
     You see the nice fibers of the muscle? Yeah, well done. Yeah, I'm an RT
},
{
    455.36,459.76
     Now the blood flow this represents an artery coming in and it drops off into the
},
{
    460.28,462.8
     capillaries and all the finer areas
},
{
    467.6,474.14
     capillaries and all the finer areas of the blood circulation that goes in and feeds the muscle blood oxygen and nutrients so the muscle can contract and maintain its job and a muscle as a
},
{
    474.14,480.78
     result produces carbon dioxide, lactic acid, uric acid, a lot of waste products they have to leave
},
{
    480.78,490.66
     the muscle and they have to go back into the system and your body recycles it so to speak. Now if this muscle becomes tight, just like
},
{
    490.66,495.2
     this muscle like a sponge, if a sponge is relaxed it can absorb a lot of water
},
{
    495.2,499.12
     just like muscles, if muscles are relaxed it can absorb a lot of blood flow. If they
},
{
    499.12,504.08
     tighten up and you squeeze all the water out of this or the blood gets squeezed
},
{
    504.08,505.04
     out of a muscle
},
{
    508.52,508.6
     You can't get blood back into it because it's tight, okay?
},
{
    515.68,519.16
     Like a sponge you loosen it up, water will absorb if you loosen up a muscle and the nutrients are the waste products can go out Right and the fresh blood can get in so it's a whole cycle
},
{
    519.16,523.92
     So this past your tight muscles for hours on end is going to create pain
},
{
    523.92,525.8
     You got that lactic acid in that muscle
},
{
    525.8,530.7
     That's not getting out of there and just thinking that acid in there building up and burning and that's why you're gonna find out
},
{
    530.7,535.72
     We're gonna need to stretch that muscle and get it moving so that you get blood flow into it and the waste product
},
{
    535.72,540.0
     Exactly so the first thing we're gonna do is change your posture
},
{
    540.08,545.4
     So Bob had this head forward posture. I'm gonna say Bob you got to change your ways a little bit
},
{
    545.4,549.3
     So I'm gonna go like this and get them up here tuck that chin in a little bit
},
{
    549.3,551.3
     Trying to line up the ears with the shoulders
},
{
    551.56,557.68
     That allows these muscles not to have to work near so hard and a lot of times those muscles once they get tight
},
{
    558.16,571.78
     They kind of stay tight. Yeah, you got to work them out. It's hard to break it up with the tightness. So they got a tool called, why don't you grab that? Theracane Bob. This is the Theracane OPTP cells.com and this works out really well
},
{
    571.78,575.02
     You can just you can work your way into those muscles here
},
{
    575.02,580.02
     You can just do point pressure like pressure right on the trigger point or you can actually
},
{
    580.02,584.58
     I actually use it as almost a massage or two. Get some work it down like that
},
{
    584.58,589.52
     Like you said getting more blood flow to the area, really a nice way to get things moving
},
{
    589.52,595.88
     I like this, and then just stretching the muscle, so you can do a side stretch over here
},
{
    595.88,600.96
     Now you're not gonna stretch really hard these are thin broad muscles, and you don't want to pull them hard
},
{
    600.96,604.88
     You just want it gentle, my fingertips is all I'm doing that's gonna get that scaling muscle
},
{
    604.88,607.88
     I talked about if you go forward looking down your pocket
},
{
    608.0,612.28
     Gentle stretch that'll get that upper trap a little bit. The levator scapula
},
{
    612.68,618.04
     Okay, typically we don't teach to stretch down though. Okay. Now I can cause other issues
},
{
    618.04,624.44
     Right, so to the side and down at an angle in both directions. And I would say shoulder shrugs Brad
},
{
    624.44,626.72
     Just getting things moving here every so often
},
{
    626.72,630.44
     You know these are these are the ones you should be doing throughout the day
},
{
    631.64,634.64
     Certainly you could do every hour if not every 20 minutes
},
{
    635.04,637.12
     So I'm bringing up I squeeze them back
},
{
    637.6,640.36
     One two three four five six seven eight nine ten relax
},
{
    640.4,645.04
     Okay, you do five of those and you'll find things are loosening up, exactly
},
{
    645.48,648.16
     Chin touch is another good one, you're sitting there
},
{
    648.16,653.88
     It's gonna help you remind you to keep good power aligned, you don't have to push in with your hand
},
{
    653.88,658.0
     I always do because it gives me a little more stretch, make sure your computer screen is up high enough
},
{
    658.0,659.48
     You don't want to be down here
},
{
    659.48,662.04
     So you're looking at the screen and not down at the screen
},
{
    662.88,665.88
     And then some heat you add to it
},
{
    666.04,668.54
     Just a hot pack a warm shower
},
{
    668.92,673.04
     I'm not big on hot tubs because I think it's a lazy person's way to work out
},
{
    673.04,677.3
     But in this case I think it's gonna loosen up a muscle and do well with it
},
{
    677.3,679.3
     All right, I'll buy one now Brad just to you said that
},
{
    679.8,683.24
     If it's pinched nerve Brad, I guess we got whole videos on that, right?
},
{
    683.24,685.0
     I don't know that we want to need to go into that now
},
{
    685.0,690.2
     If it is a pinched nerve, you're gonna have to go into one of our videos for a neck pain with RMP
},
{
    690.2,694.56
     Right, yeah, exactly. So this is related to
},
{
    695.2,701.06
     Our problem that we can't solve yet, but this is a big part of it Bob. We can fix anything except for
},
{
    701.06,705.22
     I'm gonna put the broken heart right here. Yeah, right. If you fix anything except for a broken heart, okay
},
{
    705.22,707.56
     But we're trying we're working at it. Thanks
},
