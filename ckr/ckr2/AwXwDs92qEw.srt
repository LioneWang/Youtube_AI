     Bob and Brad, the two most famous physical therapists
},
{
    6.72,8.04
     on the internet.
},
{
    11.16,12.96
     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.
},
{
    12.96,14.12
     Brad Heineck, physical therapist.
},
{
    14.12,16.08
     We're the most famous physical therapists on the internet.
},
{
    16.08,17.36
     In our opinion, of course, Bob.
},
{
    17.36,19.56
     Today we're gonna talk about how to use a TENS unit
},
{
    19.56,22.92
     with low back pain and basically we're gonna show you
},
{
    22.92,24.92
     correct pad placement.
},
{
    24.92,26.86
     As a bonus, at the end of this video, we're gonna show you correct pad placement. As a bonus, at the end of this video,
},
{
    26.86,28.8
     we're gonna show you a treatment that you can do
},
{
    28.8,30.92
     along with the pain, you know, pain.
},
{
    30.92,31.76
     Two of them, right?
},
{
    31.76,32.58
     Along with the 10s, yeah.
},
{
    32.58,37.04
     Two different treatments that work with a lot of back patients.
},
{
    37.04,40.32
     And you can sometimes, by using the 10s,
},
{
    40.32,41.68
     it calms down the pain enough
},
{
    41.68,44.36
     that you can do the treatments successfully.
},
{
    44.36,46.22
     So yeah, they're two exercises.
},
{
    46.22,47.06
     Yeah.
},
{
    47.06,50.36
     So what we're doing here is we're not really showing you
},
{
    50.36,51.88
     how to use a 10s unit.
},
{
    51.88,54.62
     And we're not trying to be deceptive here,
},
{
    54.62,55.72
     but what we're gonna talk-
},
{
    55.72,57.24
     We do show it on other videos.
},
{
    57.24,58.92
     We show it on other videos.
},
{
    58.92,63.0
     Brad and I have tried dozens and dozens of 10s units
},
{
    63.0,65.98
     and they all worked. they all worked great.
},
{
    65.98,67.42
     A lot of them are really powerful,
},
{
    67.42,69.88
     a lot of them work out fantastic.
},
{
    69.88,72.76
     Some of them have really poor instructions.
},
{
    72.76,76.32
     So we decided after a while, after we've viewed quite a few
},
{
    76.32,79.04
     that we're gonna endorse just one brand.
},
{
    79.04,83.32
     And we endorse the Irelieve because it's FDA approved,
},
{
    83.32,87.76
     it's compact, it's powerful, it has it all, it's good instructions.
},
{
    87.76,89.64
     Yeah, they work well, we're happy with them.
},
{
    89.64,91.08
     In addition to their instructions,
},
{
    91.08,94.42
     we've actually done a step-by-step video
},
{
    94.42,97.56
     on how to use three of their different models.
},
{
    97.56,101.76
     The 1313, the 8080 and the 5050.
},
{
    101.76,104.12
     And that varies from their low priced one
},
{
    104.12,106.92
     up to their highest priced one, which is a wireless one.
},
{
    106.92,111.28
     So if you wanna see those, go to bobandbrad.com,
},
{
    111.28,115.88
     go to our program section and look for the TENS program.
},
{
    115.88,118.76
     And under TENS program, you'll find a video
},
{
    118.76,123.24
     that says 1313 step-by-step or 8080 step-by-step.
},
{
    123.24,125.88
     And along with that, as well as these,
},
{
    125.88,128.2
     there's PDF printouts for each video.
},
{
    128.2,129.32
     Oh, thanks for reminding me Brad.
},
{
    129.32,130.72
     We didn't mention it on the last video.
},
{
    130.72,132.32
     Yes, I forgot too.
},
{
    132.32,133.88
     But that makes it very convenient.
},
{
    133.88,135.96
     Watch a video, get the printout,
},
{
    135.96,138.24
     and then, well, you don't have to refer back to the video.
},
{
    138.24,141.36
     You can look at the printout and it'll remind you
},
{
    141.36,142.2
     of what we talked about.
},
{
    142.2,145.16
     Yeah, so like if you find this video on our website,
},
{
    145.16,147.96
     there'll be a printout of what we talked about today
},
{
    147.96,149.92
     so you know where to place the pads.
},
{
    149.92,151.64
     And that's what we're gonna talk about next.
},
{
    151.64,153.72
     So we're low back pain,
},
{
    153.72,156.84
     we're gonna show you one sided with one channel,
},
{
    156.84,158.96
     and then we're gonna show you low back pain,
},
{
    158.96,161.32
     let's say you have a more larger area,
},
{
    161.32,163.84
     so we'll show two sided with two channels.
},
{
    163.84,166.76
     Now, all of you have told us that you don't want to see us
},
{
    166.76,170.8
     with our shirts off, so we're gonna have our cameraman,
},
{
    170.8,173.7
     Mike, come on out, and I'm gonna be the camera person.
},
{
    173.7,174.54
     Oh, you are?
},
{
    174.54,175.54
     Yeah, you can handle it, can't you?
},
{
    175.54,177.16
     Well, I'll give it a go, Bob.
},
{
    177.16,179.12
     I can comment still behind the camera, too.
},
{
    179.12,180.46
     Sure.
},
{
    180.46,182.48
     All right, Mike's gonna come on out,
},
{
    182.48,187.52
     and everybody take note of his SpongeBob, Bob,
},
{
    187.52,189.4
     SpongeBob, SpongeBob.
},
{
    189.4,190.9
     SpongeBob, yeah.
},
{
    190.9,195.82
     SpongeBob shirt, that's his pride and joy.
},
{
    195.82,199.76
     So luckily Mike is not mic'd up so we can't hear him.
},
{
    199.76,202.44
     So Mike, if you wanna go ahead and...
},
{
    202.44,204.36
     I know the camera.
},
{
    204.36,205.5
     Mike, you wanna go ahead? Faint know the camera. Mike, you wanna go ahead.
},
{
    205.5,206.34
     Faintly.
},
{
    207.64,208.96
     All right, there we go.
},
{
    209.9,212.22
     So Brad's gonna start off with the low back.
},
{
    212.22,214.94
     Again, one-sided, that means one channel.
},
{
    214.94,215.78
     Yep.
},
{
    215.78,218.68
     Okay, so we're gonna start one channel.
},
{
    218.68,221.02
     We have our pads here.
},
{
    221.02,225.0
     Typically, all of these will come with four pads,
},
{
    226.2,227.4
     two pads per channel.
},
{
    227.4,231.52
     We colored them yellow and green, each channel,
},
{
    231.52,232.88
     just so it's easier to see.
},
{
    232.88,233.92
     They'll come black.
},
{
    233.92,235.28
     Sometimes they're white,
},
{
    235.28,237.76
     but they're not colored when you pull them out of the box.
},
{
    237.76,240.68
     It's just for instructional purposes.
},
{
    240.68,243.28
     Each channel gets one wire,
},
{
    243.28,245.0
     which actually has two wires.
},
{
    246.36,248.36
     Yeah, leads that are also called.
},
{
    248.36,252.62
     Yep, leads, pigtails, you'll hear different terminology
},
{
    252.62,254.52
     for that, so I'm gonna take a pad.
},
{
    254.52,256.52
     Let's see, Mike, my fingers are cold, Mike,
},
{
    256.52,257.72
     so he might jump.
},
{
    257.72,258.56
     He's gonna jump.
},
{
    258.56,262.86
     On the right side, let's see, belt line pain right there.
},
{
    262.86,264.24
     Yep.
},
{
    264.24,266.1
     If the pain is right there,
},
{
    266.1,267.7
     it's kind of a focal point.
},
{
    267.7,272.7
     One option is to put one pad right over the painful spot.
},
{
    273.14,273.98
     Okay.
},
{
    274.9,277.38
     And then take the second pad
},
{
    278.9,280.82
     and you could go above.
},
{
    280.82,284.5
     Now, you can, the big thing you do not wanna do
},
{
    284.5,285.6
     is go too close.
},
{
    285.6,287.48
     You should never be touching.
},
{
    287.48,289.64
     You want to keep the width of one pad
},
{
    289.64,293.12
     that's about there, that much distance between,
},
{
    293.12,294.32
     or you can go a little farther,
},
{
    294.32,296.16
     but you're not going to go way up here.
},
{
    296.16,299.44
     You know, so you're going to be that one to two inches there.
},
{
    299.44,303.28
     And then Mike could take this and turn it on
},
{
    303.28,307.84
     and increase the intensity and see how it responds.
},
{
    307.84,309.6
     Yeah, so it's always an experiment.
},
{
    309.6,313.64
     There's really no specific right or wrong.
},
{
    313.64,317.2
     Mike's gonna give it a try if he feels good.
},
{
    317.2,318.04
     Yeah.
},
{
    318.04,319.44
     Yeah, leave him there.
},
{
    319.44,321.48
     If he doesn't like the way it's feeling,
},
{
    321.48,324.48
     it's not managing the pain or reducing the pain.
},
{
    324.48,326.0
     You could try over here. You could try over here.
},
{
    326.0,327.54
     You could try over here.
},
{
    327.54,329.1
     I'm not gonna have him pull his pants down,
},
{
    329.1,330.48
     but we could go below.
},
{
    330.48,333.04
     We're not gonna obviously go over the cloth.
},
{
    333.04,335.48
     And one thing I didn't mention yet is
},
{
    335.48,338.88
     make sure you clean the skin very well with soap and water.
},
{
    338.88,340.52
     Dry it well.
},
{
    340.52,341.76
     Keep the pads clean.
},
{
    341.76,346.76
     They always keep these plastic keepers, I'm gonna call it,
},
{
    346.76,348.12
     available.
},
{
    348.12,351.4
     You always put them back on there when you're done.
},
{
    351.4,353.36
     And pull them off here.
},
{
    353.36,357.4
     You can take off the oils of the skin with soap and water
},
{
    357.4,359.16
     because that would also affect the pads.
},
{
    359.16,360.0
     Right.
},
{
    360.0,360.84
     Didn't I mention that?
},
{
    360.84,361.68
     Oh, did you?
},
{
    361.68,363.6
     That's all right.
},
{
    363.6,364.96
     It's always good to hear it twice.
},
{
    364.96,366.4
     It's really important.
},
{
    366.4,368.44
     Mike has a gorilla back with hair on it.
},
{
    368.44,370.6
     You're gonna have to shave it, but he looks pretty smooth.
},
{
    370.6,371.44
     Exactly.
},
{
    371.44,374.84
     If you do have a hairy back, you really need to shave it
},
{
    374.84,376.76
     because that will interfere with the conduction
},
{
    376.76,379.16
     of the current and the effects of it
},
{
    379.16,382.08
     as well as keeping the pads last longer.
},
{
    382.08,384.92
     So, how should we go to four?
},
{
    384.92,386.8
     No, how about the other option of,
},
{
    386.8,389.12
     let's say you surround the pain.
},
{
    389.12,391.34
     Let's say you only have two pads,
},
{
    391.34,394.48
     but let's say, point to where the pain is.
},
{
    394.48,396.76
     The pain is still the same location,
},
{
    396.76,400.12
     but we're gonna go on both sides of it.
},
{
    400.12,402.0
     So we're gonna cross.
},
{
    402.0,406.04
     So the current actually goes from one pad to the other.
},
{
    406.04,408.7
     And so just imagine that's where it's going.
},
{
    408.7,410.32
     We can go there.
},
{
    410.32,414.56
     You know, we could go here and then below the pain.
},
{
    414.56,418.2
     I'm gonna go there, pretend the pain is up higher
},
{
    418.2,420.24
     so that I can go on the skin.
},
{
    420.24,423.18
     Or you can, you know, you can go crisscrosses.
},
{
    423.18,426.1
     It really doesn't matter where you put it,
},
{
    426.1,428.46
     but you wanna cross the pain.
},
{
    428.46,432.26
     If the pain is a global area on this side,
},
{
    432.26,434.9
     you could, are we gonna go four channels on one side?
},
{
    434.9,437.56
     I would also say Brad, right from the start,
},
{
    437.56,440.16
     I probably wouldn't put it right on the spine,
},
{
    440.16,441.3
     right on the bony spine.
},
{
    441.3,442.14
     Sure, yep.
},
{
    442.14,443.9
     I would stay off that area.
},
{
    443.9,446.4
     I would stick more into the soft tissue.
},
{
    446.4,448.24
     Sure, like that.
},
{
    448.24,449.08
     Yep.
},
{
    449.08,450.6
     Yep, and then over here.
},
{
    451.76,453.08
     Let's say if it is,
},
{
    454.84,456.36
     we're gonna go way up to here.
},
{
    456.36,459.52
     Let's say it's kind of a global area.
},
{
    459.52,462.08
     Then you take both channels,
},
{
    462.08,465.0
     which works fine to use them both at the same time.
},
{
    465.0,468.26
     So yeah, now he's using all four pads.
},
{
    468.26,473.12
     And I'm going to take channel one and place them as such.
},
{
    473.12,477.06
     Channel two, we're going to go here.
},
{
    477.06,479.56
     Oops.
},
{
    479.56,486.84
     And again, on the PDF, it's got actually pictures of this, so you can get that reinforced as to where you might try it.
},
{
    486.84,489.4
     But do you wanna show how the current travels
},
{
    489.4,490.24
     between the two, Brad?
},
{
    490.24,492.24
     Yeah, so it's gonna go yellow to yellow.
},
{
    492.24,495.72
     Channel one to channel one, channel two to channel two.
},
{
    495.72,499.64
     So it crisscrosses and that way you get a more
},
{
    499.64,504.64
     broad area for pain management and to decrease that pain.
},
{
    504.64,508.18
     You know, again, I can get these little farther apart
},
{
    508.18,509.88
     without any problem.
},
{
    509.88,512.4
     I'm certainly not gonna go this far apart.
},
{
    512.4,514.0
     I think that's too far.
},
{
    514.0,516.64
     So, you know, you can cover one side of the back easy.
},
{
    516.64,519.2
     And actually we're gonna show both sides of the back.
},
{
    519.2,520.38
     Yeah, if you go both sides of the back,
},
{
    520.38,524.48
     you could put one on one side and one on the other side.
},
{
    524.48,526.06
     Yep, just like that.
},
{
    526.06,528.0
     And this works nice if it's more central,
},
{
    528.0,529.46
     but a larger area.
},
{
    529.46,531.98
     If you're feeling it on the spine,
},
{
    531.98,534.18
     but we don't wanna put pads on there,
},
{
    534.18,537.66
     there we go, and then we got a crisscross going on.
},
{
    537.66,539.82
     Now, I just wanna repeat this again.
},
{
    539.82,542.34
     I've had a lot of patients where the pain
},
{
    542.34,544.3
     is at the belt line,
},
{
    544.3,547.12
     so then obviously you gotta drop the pants down.
},
{
    547.12,552.12
     And you'll have the pads actually on one butt.
},
{
    552.24,555.48
     On each cheek and these will drop down.
},
{
    555.48,557.2
     Then you just pull the pants up over the top.
},
{
    557.2,558.04
     And that works good,
},
{
    558.04,561.4
     because that actually holds the pads in place a little bit.
},
{
    561.4,562.96
     Yeah, see what works for you.
},
{
    562.96,563.8
     Exactly.
},
{
    563.8,565.42
     It's nice, you can hook up the pads
},
{
    565.42,567.26
     and then you just put the unit in your pocket
},
{
    567.26,570.54
     and you've got some relief all, you know,
},
{
    570.54,571.7
     for a couple of hours.
},
{
    571.7,575.66
     And luckily with 10 sometimes you get some relief afterwards
},
{
    575.66,576.7
     even after you stop using it.
},
{
    576.7,579.38
     Yeah, that's very common report.
},
{
    579.38,581.9
     So these would be all hooked up accordingly.
},
{
    581.9,584.58
     This would go in his pocket and.
},
{
    584.58,585.56
     All right, set it up.
},
{
    585.56,587.84
     Mike, why don't you come on back?
},
{
    587.84,589.04
     Brad, you wanna take those off?
},
{
    589.04,590.62
     Oh!
},
{
    590.62,593.08
     And then we'll show the exercise next.
},
{
    593.08,593.92
     Oh, okay.
},
{
    593.92,595.32
     So I'm gonna take them off.
},
{
    595.32,596.8
     And like I mentioned before,
},
{
    596.8,600.36
     we'll put them back on the holding plastic.
},
{
    600.36,602.12
     They're home to stay clean.
},
{
    602.12,603.36
     Thank you, Mike.
},
{
    603.36,604.76
     Good work, Mike.
},
{
    604.76,607.28
     Putting up with my nice cold hands.
},
{
    607.28,609.12
     He does have cold hands.
},
{
    609.12,611.6
     All right, Brad, if you wanna stand up,
},
{
    611.6,612.84
     if you don't mind for a second,
},
{
    612.84,614.56
     I'm gonna go ahead and jump right in there.
},
{
    614.56,615.56
     Yep, go ahead.
},
{
    615.56,619.32
     Now a common exercise for just the average person,
},
{
    619.32,620.88
     let's say you're not too old,
},
{
    620.88,622.52
     like when you get into your 50s and 60s,
},
{
    622.52,625.12
     a lot of you are gonna have spinal stenosis
},
{
    625.12,628.12
     and some arthritis and this may not feel good.
},
{
    628.12,631.6
     So this is probably maybe for a little bit younger person,
},
{
    631.6,633.96
     but this is one that you should always try
},
{
    633.96,635.86
     is trunk extensions.
},
{
    635.86,638.4
     So what you're gonna do is lay flat on your stomach,
},
{
    638.4,640.56
     hopefully not crush your tie,
},
{
    640.56,643.12
     put your hands right underneath your shoulders
},
{
    643.12,644.24
     and you're gonna press up.
},
{
    644.24,647.76
     And we start off with like mini press ups,
},
{
    647.76,648.6
     Brad calls them.
},
{
    648.6,650.08
     Yeah.
},
{
    650.08,653.32
     So notice he keeps his waistline at the belt.
},
{
    653.32,655.12
     Yeah, I'm not lifting up like this.
},
{
    655.12,658.12
     I'm getting movement in the spine.
},
{
    658.12,661.04
     And it's kind of the opposite of what you typically put
},
{
    661.04,663.52
     stress on the back during the day.
},
{
    663.52,666.0
     You're doing a lot of bending forward during the day.
},
{
    666.0,667.6
     This helps counteract that.
},
{
    667.6,670.12
     It helps it stretch in the other direction.
},
{
    670.12,671.92
     And then eventually you wanna see if you can get
},
{
    671.92,675.92
     all the way up like this without lifting your pelvis off.
},
{
    675.92,677.4
     You'll get up to here,
},
{
    677.4,679.52
     and then your pelvis starts coming off.
},
{
    679.52,682.2
     You have to keep working this area here.
},
{
    682.2,685.92
     Keep in mind if this irritates or this causes pain,
},
{
    685.92,688.76
     or particularly pain down the leg,
},
{
    688.76,690.28
     then you're not gonna wanna do it.
},
{
    690.28,691.64
     You should just do this gently.
},
{
    691.64,694.64
     It should feel good while you do it,
},
{
    694.64,695.96
     and after you get done.
},
{
    695.96,698.0
     People often say it hurts so good.
},
{
    698.0,700.56
     You know, it feels like the right kind of pain.
},
{
    700.56,703.92
     Now, one that you almost everybody can do
},
{
    703.92,707.76
     would be the gentle, what we call trunk rotations.
},
{
    707.76,712.32
     So you lay in, you lie down in the hook line position,
},
{
    712.32,715.72
     your feet are on the bed or on the floor,
},
{
    715.72,718.28
     and you're just gonna keep your knees together,
},
{
    718.28,720.72
     and you call it the windshield wipers, don't you Brad?
},
{
    720.72,723.76
     Well, that's what I instructed to my patients,
},
{
    723.76,725.58
     because if you look at it from your view,
},
{
    725.58,727.88
     you're going back and forth like windshield wipers.
},
{
    727.88,730.7
     So it's like windshield wipers, and like you said,
},
{
    730.7,735.4
     it's a way of remembering visually what's going on.
},
{
    735.4,740.0
     And if this bothers you going in one direction,
},
{
    740.0,741.28
     don't go in that direction,
},
{
    741.28,743.24
     go in the other direction for a while,
},
{
    743.24,744.3
     and then try it again.
},
{
    744.3,745.56
     Yep. But this can really loosen up the back, it's a great one to do in the other direction for a while, and then try it again.
},
{
    747.4,748.76
     But this can really loosen up the back. It's a great one to do in the morning
},
{
    748.76,750.44
     before you get out of bed.
},
{
    750.44,755.44
     It gets the back warmed up prior to starting the day.
},
{
    756.36,759.44
     And this is, with both of these exercises,
},
{
    759.44,762.22
     something you can do not just once a day,
},
{
    762.22,764.56
     you can actually do it every hour
},
{
    764.56,767.12
     as a way to keep the back moving and relax it
},
{
    767.12,769.36
     and just start combating pain.
},
{
    769.36,771.96
     So, I'll re-end up so long on this video Brad.
},
{
    771.96,774.72
     I don't know Bob, we're just a little blamin' on Mike.
},
{
    774.72,776.16
     Okay, yeah, that's Mike's fault.
},
{
    776.16,778.36
     That's SpongeBob's, sir.
},
{
    778.36,None
     Thanks for watching. you
},
