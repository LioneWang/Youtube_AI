     you Good morning. I'm Kristen. I'm here to draw your blood today.
},
{
    27.0,28.0
     Good morning.
},
{
    28.0,41.0
     Could you please state your name and date of birth?
},
{
    41.0,45.6
     Pat White, November 11th. Good morning, I'm Kristen, I'm here to draw your blood today.
},
{
    45.6,46.6
     Good morning.
},
{
    46.6,48.6
     Could you please state your name and date of birth?
},
{
    48.6,52.36
     Pat White, November 11th, 1986.
},
{
    52.36,53.52
     Thank you.
},
{
    53.52,56.48
     Have you had anything to eat or drink in the last 12 hours?
},
{
    56.48,57.92
     Not since nine last night.
},
{
    57.92,58.92
     Thanks.
},
{
    58.92,59.92
     Do you have any questions?
},
{
    59.92,60.92
     No.
},
{
    60.92,62.92
     All right, it will just take me a minute to get everything set.
},
{
    62.92,67.08
     Blood collection by Veena Puncture is one of the most common procedures performed in
},
{
    67.08,68.96
     a healthcare setting.
},
{
    68.96,74.58
     Common but also complex, requiring knowledge and skill to assure the accuracy and integrity
},
{
    74.58,79.84
     of the samples drawn and to eliminate risk to both patient and healthcare workers.
},
{
    79.84,85.12
     The first step is to accurately ID the patient using at least two forms of identification.
},
{
    85.12,89.8
     Does the name and date of birth on the requisition form match what the patient is telling you?
},
{
    89.8,92.72
     Does it match what is on the patient ID wristband?
},
{
    92.72,97.28
     Has the patient followed special orders, such as fasting prior to blood draw?
},
{
    97.28,102.88
     Address the inconsistency first with a requesting physician or healthcare worker on duty.
},
{
    102.88,107.6
     But if the given information does agree, it's time to prepare yourself and the patient
},
{
    107.6,111.56
     for a successful blood draw using proper standard precautions.
},
{
    111.56,114.04
     The phlebotomist washes and then dons
},
{
    114.04,117.2
     a clean pair of gloves before proceeding.
},
{
    117.2,120.28
     Make sure alcohol prep pads, gauze, tape,
},
{
    120.28,123.64
     the correct gauge needles and required evacuated collection
},
{
    123.64,125.84
     tubes are with an easy reach for you,
},
{
    125.84,128.56
     but out of the reach of the patient.
},
{
    128.56,132.88
     Then speak reassuringly to the patient as you position him for the draw.
},
{
    132.88,138.16
     I'm all set here. If you'd please straighten your arm.
},
{
    138.16,140.32
     It'll just take a moment while I apply the tourniquet.
},
{
    140.32,146.0
     Applying a tourniquet slows the flow of blood in the veins and increases venous filling,
},
{
    146.0,151.0
     thus making the veins more prominent, easier to locate, and easier to enter.
},
{
    151.0,157.0
     However, leaving the tourniquet on for longer than one minute may affect laboratory test results
},
{
    157.0,170.88
     and should therefore be removed and reapplied if the procedure will take longer than one minute. Use your fingertip to palpate the anticubital fossa to locate the median cubital vein.
},
{
    170.88,174.84
     Palpation helps determine the direction of blood flow in the vein to gauge the vein's
},
{
    174.84,179.12
     size and depth and to estimate its tendency to roll.
},
{
    179.12,182.44
     It also helps differentiate veins from arteries.
},
{
    182.44,189.88
     Unlike veins, arteries have thicker feeling walls and are more elastic to the touch.
},
{
    189.88,194.76
     Use an alcohol prep pad to cleanse the skin around the site.
},
{
    194.76,200.44
     In a fluid, circular motion, swab from the center to the periphery of the site, being
},
{
    200.44,207.0
     careful not to drag the pad back across the cleanse field. Let the area air dry.
},
{
    207.0,211.0
     This prevents contamination of either the patient or the specimen.
},
{
    211.0,220.0
     Grasp the patient's arm firmly with your hand, placing your thumb approximately two inches below the intended puncture site.
},
{
    220.0,224.0
     With your thumb, pull the skin taut over the vein to help anchor it in place.
},
{
    224.0,229.24
     Then let the patient know you're ready to make the puncture so the patient won't startle and jump.
},
{
    229.24,231.64
     You'll feel a slight pinch.
},
{
    231.64,235.74
     Position the needle, bevel side up, and line it up with a vein.
},
{
    235.74,240.5
     Position the needle so that it forms a 30 degree angle with the surface of the arm.
},
{
    240.5,247.0
     With a single, short, but firm motion, swiftly insert the needle through the skin and into the vein.
},
{
    247.0,251.0
     Push the evacuated tube onto the needle when the needle enters the vein.
},
{
    251.0,257.0
     As the vein aligns with the needle, blood will begin to move out of the vein up into the needle.
},
{
    257.0,262.0
     Maintain a constant, slight forward pressure on the end of the tube.
},
{
    262.0,266.0
     The evacuated tubes are color-coded based on their additives.
},
{
    266.0,269.0
     Know the types of additives and which color tubes
},
{
    269.0,272.0
     are to be drawn based on requisition.
},
{
    272.0,275.0
     As soon as blood begins to flow into the collection tube,
},
{
    275.0,277.0
     instruct the patient to open his hand
},
{
    277.0,279.0
     and remove the tourniquet from his arm.
},
{
    279.0,282.0
     Removing the tourniquet allows the blood to return
},
{
    282.0,284.0
     to its normal rate of flow through the vein
},
{
    284.0,290.28
     and helps reduce bleeding at the puncture site.
},
{
    290.28,295.78
     A gentle mixing by inversion at least eight times is required to ensure that any additives
},
{
    295.78,299.44
     in the tube are incorporated into the blood sample.
},
{
    299.44,301.12
     We're almost finished here.
},
{
    301.12,302.12
     Are you doing okay?
},
{
    302.12,310.0
     Fine. Engage the safety device on the needle and use the sharps device for proper disposal.
},
{
    310.0,319.0
     Applying pressure at the needle entry site immediately after removing the needle will prevent a hematoma from forming and allow hemostasis to seal the wound.
},
{
    319.0,328.0
     Please keep pressure on the gauze pad for several minutes to ensure that the blood flow stops.
},
{
    328.0,334.12
     In this illustration, you can see formation of the platelet plug and the fibrin clot.
},
{
    334.12,338.04
     Applying pressure at the needle entry site immediately after removing the needle will
},
{
    338.04,343.44
     prevent a hematoma from forming and allow hemostasis to seal the wound.
},
{
    343.44,348.0
     In this illustration, you can see formation of the platelet plug and fibrin clot.
},
{
    349.0,355.0
     Apply the ID label on the filled evacuation tube and store it for transport to the lab.
},
{
    355.0,361.0
     The label must include at least the patient's ID number, full name, date of birth, and today's date.
},
{
    362.0,365.06
     Using standard precautions, dispose of needles in a
},
{
    365.06,370.24
     sharps container, dispense of all other used non-sharp materials, including use
},
{
    370.24,375.78
     gloves and gauze pads in an approved trash receptacle, and disinfect all
},
{
    375.78,380.84
     contaminated surface areas. You've just completed a successful blood draw,
},
{
    380.84,385.0
     providing a sample that can be processed for analysis.
},
{
    385.0,389.0
     Fortunately, most blood draws are completed in an entirely professional,
},
{
    389.0,394.0
     skilled, and successful manner. Most, but not all.
},
{
    394.0,399.0
     Poor technique, poor judgment, lack of knowledge, loss of concentration,
},
{
    399.0,404.0
     and undue haste, all are factors that can negatively impact the integrity
},
{
    404.0,406.36
     of a sample, or worse, that can negatively impact the integrity of a sample. Or worse,
},
{
    406.36,412.08
     that can create undue stress and pain for the patient or cause a patient physical harm.
},
{
    412.08,417.6
     Let's take a look. Failure to align the needle perfectly with the vein and failure to insert
},
{
    417.6,423.54
     the needle at a 30 degree angle can result in the needle missing its mark. Poor technique
},
{
    423.54,427.0
     that will require an unwelcome second needle stick.
},
{
    427.0,431.0
     Inserting the needle at too steep or too shallow an angle
},
{
    431.0,433.0
     and not lining up precisely with a vein
},
{
    433.0,437.0
     are two common reasons for missing the vein.
},
{
    437.0,441.0
     To the patient, that usually means only one thing,
},
{
    441.0,444.0
     further anxiety and discomfort.
},
{
    444.0,447.4
     But it can have other consequences as well.
},
{
    447.4,450.28
     Serious complications are most likely to arise
},
{
    450.28,452.96
     when targeting the bacillic vein.
},
{
    452.96,455.12
     With its close proximity to nerves,
},
{
    455.12,457.24
     which can be permanently damaged,
},
{
    457.24,460.12
     or the brachial artery, which could be nicked,
},
{
    460.12,461.76
     even with a proper angle,
},
{
    461.76,464.5
     the appropriate needle size must be used.
},
{
    465.78,468.22
     Ready? You're only gonna feel a very small pinch this time.
},
{
    468.22,469.22
     Uh-huh.
},
{
    469.22,472.68
     It is acceptable to use a smaller needle called a butterfly.
},
{
    472.68,477.06
     However, it should be noted that butterflies are a larger gauge needle,
},
{
    477.06,482.7
     23 to 25 gauge, and therefore have a smaller bore size.
},
{
    482.7,486.94
     A large gauge straight needle, 25 gauge in this case,
},
{
    486.94,489.36
     may make piercing the vein more certain,
},
{
    489.36,491.84
     but as you can see, the smaller bore size
},
{
    491.84,494.3
     can cause the red blood cells to lice.
},
{
    495.2,497.28
     While it appeared to the healthcare professional
},
{
    497.28,499.48
     that this blood draw was successful,
},
{
    499.48,502.36
     it's clear once the sample is centrifuged
},
{
    502.36,510.52
     that the choice of needle gauge was a poor one. The selection compromised the integrity of the sample. Aside from these two
},
{
    510.52,514.88
     examples of invisible errors, there are many visible signs that a health care
},
{
    514.88,518.8
     professional may not be following standard precautions that ensure a
},
{
    518.8,528.0
     quality blood draw as well as a satisfactory customer experience. Music
},
{
    528.0,532.0

     Music Alright, you're good to go.
},
{
    550.48,551.48
     That's it?
},
{
    551.48,555.92
     Yeah, I just need to put some tape on it.
},
{
    555.92,567.0
     Ah, bandaid, that'll work.
},
{
    567.0,569.0
     What about this?
},
{
    569.0,572.0
     Oh, you're good to go.
},
{
    572.0,574.0
     Good to go?
},
{
    574.0,576.0
     Not necessarily.
},
{
    576.0,578.0
     Failure to apply pressure on the puncture site
},
{
    578.0,580.0
     immediately following removal of the needle
},
{
    580.0,582.0
     can cause bleeding from the vein
},
{
    582.0,584.0
     into the space around it,
},
{
    584.0,585.0
     forming a hematoma,
},
{
    585.0,591.0
     a collection of blood under the skin surface that will become bruised in appearance and painful to the touch.
},
{
    593.0,599.0
     There are many times, of course, when a single blood draw involves more than the collection of a single sample.
},
{
    599.0,603.0
     You may be required to collect as many as 10 tubes in a single draw,
},
{
    603.0,605.68
     and this requires even greater
},
{
    605.68,611.52
     skill and careful planning to complete successfully.
},
{
    611.52,616.68
     Two keys to a successful multiple tube draw must occur in the planning stage.
},
{
    616.68,622.34
     You need to determine which gauge needle will be appropriate for all tests being requested,
},
{
    622.34,627.88
     and you need to plan the order of the draw to assure the integrity of all samples.
},
{
    627.88,631.28
     But your technique should remain the same.
},
{
    631.28,633.64
     Let's take a few moments to review.
},
{
    633.64,635.66
     Position the needle, bevel side up,
},
{
    635.66,637.1
     and line it up with a vein.
},
{
    637.1,639.7
     Position the needle to form a 30 degree angle
},
{
    639.7,641.26
     with the surface of the arm.
},
{
    641.26,643.74
     With a single short but firm motion,
},
{
    643.74,645.32
     swiftly insert the needle through the skin and into the vein short but firm motion, swiftly insert the needle through
},
{
    645.32,650.4
     the skin and into the vein. Push the evacuated tube onto the needle when the needle enters
},
{
    650.4,655.64
     the vein. As the vein aligns with the needle, blood will begin to move out of the vein up
},
{
    655.64,661.2
     into the needle. Maintain a constant, slight forward pressure on the end of the tube to
},
{
    661.2,665.0
     prevent release of the shutoff valve.
},
{
    665.0,670.16
     As soon as blood begins to flow into the collection tube, instruct the patient to open his hand
},
{
    670.16,672.76
     and remove the tourniquet from his arm.
},
{
    672.76,676.36
     Removing the tourniquet allows the blood to return to its normal rate of flow through
},
{
    676.36,680.24
     the vein and helps reduce bleeding at the puncture site.
},
{
    680.24,686.8
     When performing a multi-tube draw, it is important to follow the correct hospital-mandated order of draw.
},
{
    686.8,689.52
     Blood cultures are always drawn first.
},
{
    689.52,694.48
     However, in a routine venopuncture, a light blue tube should be drawn first,
},
{
    694.48,698.96
     followed by a red top, gold, green, lavender, and gray.
},
{
    698.96,701.44
     We're almost done here. This is the last tube I need to draw.
},
{
    702.96,706.12
     When will I know the results? I'm kind of anxious about them.
},
{
    706.12,707.84
     Your samples will go over to the lab today
},
{
    707.84,710.84
     and your doctor will notify you after the results are in.
},
{
    710.84,711.96
     You don't see them?
},
{
    711.96,712.8
     No, I don't.
},
{
    712.8,714.72
     The samples that we draw today are
},
{
    714.72,717.6
     tested by laboratory professionals who relay those results
},
{
    717.6,719.4
     directly to the physician.
},
{
    719.4,722.76
     My responsibility is to assure the quality of the samples
},
{
    722.76,725.06
     I draw so that the results your doctor
},
{
    725.06,729.62
     receives are both accurate and meaningful. The level of quality and
},
{
    729.62,734.1
     integrity of the samples the laboratory receives is dependent upon the level of
},
{
    734.1,740.88
     skill, knowledge and professionalism of the phlebotomist. A big responsibility but
},
{
    740.88,785.46
     one that can make a real difference in the lives of your patients. Thank you.
},
