     greatest neck exercise I think ever because if the person can learn how to
},
{
    13.4,18.12
     do it correctly it helps your posture it strengthens the actual muscles of the
},
{
    18.12,23.08
     back of the neck basically you can call it the core of the neck.
},
{
    30.52,31.88
     core of the neck. You've been doing it for a while now, right? Yeah. These are making you feel better?
},
{
    31.88,37.92
     Yeah. Cool. So show us how you're doing it. So what
},
{
    37.92,40.36
     I'm going to do, what he's going to do is going to put his hands on the back of his
},
{
    40.36,43.36
     head, keep the elbows there. So what do you do first?
},
{
    43.36,47.0
     Oh, first you put your elbows close. Yeah. And then you go.
},
{
    47.0,53.68
     So he's doing it right. There you go. You arch your chest first, right? Yeah. And then start looking up to the ceiling.
},
{
    53.68,60.36
     There you go. And then what do you do with your elbows? You weigh them up. Exactly. So do you feel a stretch in the front?
},
{
    60.36,68.2
     I feel that. Oh, and then you have front and chest. Yeah, so this is a great exercise because it opens up the chest, it strengthens the
},
{
    68.2,70.84
     muscles, it changes the posture, it's just awesome.
},
{
    70.84,73.36
     And then you just bring it back down.
},
{
    73.36,75.56
     And so you start in bad posture, do it again.
},
{
    75.56,84.96
     So you arch up, there you go, and then look up to the ceiling, and then bring it out.
},
{
    84.96,85.96
     And that's it.
},
{
    85.96,86.96
     So how many reps are you doing?
},
{
    86.96,90.84
