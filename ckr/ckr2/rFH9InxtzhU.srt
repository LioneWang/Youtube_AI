     how to facilitate healing on a scraped nose. A scraped nose can be alarming, but oftentimes
},
{
    18.2,22.56
     there's no need to panic. If you properly care for the scraped nose, you're going to
},
{
    22.56,25.22
     prevent infection, reduce pain,
},
{
    25.22,28.96
     and help it heal correctly without any scars.
},
{
    28.96,31.96
     When you have a scraped nose, you wanna first apply
},
{
    31.96,33.74
     a topical pressure.
},
{
    33.74,36.7
     This topical pressure is going to reduce any bleeding
},
{
    37.62,39.46
     and really help it to stop bleeding.
},
{
    40.32,44.42
     Secondly, you wanna apply a topical antibiotic ointment.
},
{
    44.42,51.3
     I like to use two tablespoons of cocoa butter mixed with two teaspoons of raw honey.
},
{
    51.3,54.28
     This will help to prevent infection.
},
{
    54.28,56.68
     Now you want to cover it.
},
{
    56.68,59.62
     Use a band-aid and cover the area completely.
},
{
    59.62,64.08
     You don't want to be picking at it or scratching it while it's healing.
},
{
    64.08,66.72
     Lastly, if you notice that the skin
},
{
    66.72,72.6
     is not healing or that a scar is developing, you can simply apply Weet Your Moil. Weet
},
{
    72.6,77.86
     Your Moil is the whole food complex of vitamin E. I like to use the Weet Your Moil that comes
},
{
    77.86,82.96
     in pearls because if it's just liquid in a bottle, it goes rancid very quickly. So you
},
{
    82.96,90.2
     just want to take a knife or a pair of scissors, poke a hole in the wheat-chamal capsule and apply it directly to your nose.
},
{
    90.2,94.66
     This is Melanie from the Grecian Garden, your holistic health specialist, showing you how
},
{
    94.66,97.04
     to facilitate healing on a scraped nose.
