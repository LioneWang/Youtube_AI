     Hi, I'm Michelle and welcome to today's video.
},
{
    6.68,11.36
     We're talking about neck pain and when you wake up with a really tight stiff neck.
},
{
    11.36,13.64
     So this is called a rye neck.
},
{
    13.64,18.4
     It can happen when the joints in your neck become stiff and tight and as a result the
},
{
    18.4,23.24
     muscles over the top of the neck also tighten so that you actually wake and you feel that
},
{
    23.24,28.96
     you can't move your neck at all to maybe to one side or to both sides. It can feel really painful
},
{
    28.96,33.16
     and really debilitating. I'm going to be talking you through this in four steps.
},
{
    33.16,38.32
     The first step is obviously to get some pain relief on board. Take your pain
},
{
    38.32,42.32
     relief before you do anything because while your neck feels painful that
},
{
    42.32,46.32
     spasm is going to go to occur and every time you actually feel the pain
},
{
    46.32,51.68
     you're going to guard by actually tensing your neck muscles even more. So step number one,
},
{
    51.68,58.08
     get some good pain relief on board before you do anything. Step number two, use some heat. Now I've
},
{
    58.08,64.0
     got two ways of getting heat here that I like to use. You can either use a warm pack and that can
},
{
    64.0,66.88
     go in the microwave for a couple
},
{
    66.88,70.72
     of minutes before you wrap that around your neck and I'm going to be showing you some ways to use
},
{
    70.72,77.12
     the warm pack. If you don't have a warm pack that's okay. You can also use another like a way of
},
{
    77.12,85.52
     using a making a temporary warm pack is just to get a dishcloth, make it wet, you could use hot water on that or
},
{
    85.52,91.16
     you could make it wet, put it in a microwave proof bag and I like to seal that off.
},
{
    91.16,95.44
     That goes in the microwave that you can actually use around your neck as well to give you warmth.
},
{
    95.44,98.28
     And you're going to be applying heat through the course of the day.
},
{
    98.28,104.2
     Okay, so let's say you've warmed up your warm pack in the microwave.
},
{
    104.2,106.28
     What you're going to need is a towel.
},
{
    106.28,108.08
     And the reason that you use your towel
},
{
    108.08,110.12
     is to actually wrap that around your neck.
},
{
    110.12,112.72
     So I'm going to spread the towel out
},
{
    112.72,115.04
     and put it across the pillow.
},
{
    115.04,116.48
     So you can use a pillow at home.
},
{
    116.48,118.4
     You might find that the pillow is too high
},
{
    118.4,119.96
     and that you actually don't need a pillow.
},
{
    119.96,121.52
     You can just use the warm pack.
},
{
    121.52,125.32
     I'm actually going to put that warm pack inside that
},
{
    125.32,126.88
     so it's not directly against my neck
},
{
    126.88,128.08
     and causing me pain.
},
{
    128.08,129.16
     If your neck's really sore,
},
{
    129.16,131.24
     it can be really hard to move up and down.
},
{
    131.24,134.0
     So coming down sideways,
},
{
    135.24,137.48
     and then lying on that warm pack,
},
{
    137.48,139.8
     rolling over onto your back.
},
{
    139.8,144.08
     And then what you do is you bring that around your neck
},
{
    146.36,148.96
     and actually roll the towel in.
},
{
    148.96,152.64
     So that the neck is encircled by that warm pack.
},
{
    152.64,156.56
     So I've got that lovely warm pack against my neck.
},
{
    156.56,159.96
     And all I need to do is lie here and relax
},
{
    159.96,162.36
     for the next 10, 15 minutes.
},
{
    162.36,165.2
     Now I'm just lying on the warm pack.
},
{
    165.2,167.92
     The first exercise to start with
},
{
    167.92,171.16
     is just a really gentle neck roll.
},
{
    171.16,175.24
     So we're not looking to reproduce pain with these exercises
},
{
    175.24,177.0
     and if you feel discomfort,
},
{
    177.0,178.72
     I want you to stop straight away,
},
{
    178.72,180.8
     just stay still on the warm pack.
},
{
    180.8,189.92
     But if you can, start to roll your head from one side and back to centre. Move really slowly
},
{
    190.72,196.16
     and then roll to the other side. So obviously you're just moving as far as it feels comfortable
},
{
    196.16,203.36
     for your neck. Even if you can move just a centimetre or two is fine when you first start out.
},
{
    203.36,205.44
     Just starting to get some movement back
},
{
    205.44,209.84
     into your neck. I'm going to talk you through sitting up comfortably and doing
},
{
    209.84,214.72
     some exercises in sitting. So I'm going to roll the tail, we're going to bring the
},
{
    214.72,221.52
     towel back in around my neck to give me some support as I roll. So don't sit
},
{
    221.52,225.44
     forward up straight up forward. That's going to feel really uncomfortable.
},
{
    225.44,231.56
     The most comfortable way to move is using the tail around your neck and rolling onto
},
{
    231.56,234.72
     one side so your neck feels supported.
},
{
    234.72,236.8
     That should feel quite comfortable.
},
{
    236.8,244.48
     Now with the tail around your neck, you can push up sideways and sit yourself up slowly
},
{
    244.48,246.72
     over the side of the bed. You might need someone to help you
},
{
    246.9,254.54
     But that's how you come back up into sitting. So in that position then we can actually then work at taking the tail off
},
{
    255.6,259.38
     Taking the warm pack off and it might need to go back in the microwave
},
{
    260.96,262.96
     But using our
},
{
    263.24,266.84
     Our body in this position. We've got to start with some exercises in this position.
},
{
    266.84,269.64
     So we've been doing our rolling, our head lying down.
},
{
    269.64,273.0
     Now we're going to do it slowly from one side
},
{
    274.16,276.96
     and back to center and the other side.
},
{
    276.96,277.98
     So you're just rotating,
},
{
    277.98,281.92
     you're not pushing through any pain back to center.
},
{
    281.92,285.6
     If you can sit tall, lifting the crown of your head, you're going to find
},
{
    285.6,294.94
     that's easier than slumping forward and down. So try to sit tall. Let's rotate one side
},
{
    294.94,299.96
     and back. If you're feeling any pins and needles or numbness through your fingers and
},
{
    299.96,306.48
     through your hands, don't do these exercises. just get straight to medical help. Now if you can,
},
{
    307.12,310.48
     you can start to gently take your chin down towards your chest
},
{
    312.4,319.2
     and come back to neutral. Again, taking the chin down and with each successive attempt,
},
{
    319.2,324.64
     you're trying to take your chin a little bit closer down towards your chest
},
{
    328.8,334.16
     chin a little bit closer down towards your chest and release. Okay, there's one more thing that we can do to help ourselves before we get to our health
},
{
    334.16,341.16
     practitioner and that is to use some ibuprofen cream or some anti-inflammatory creams on
},
{
    341.16,342.16
     our neck.
},
{
    342.16,345.44
     So then if you can get some creams onto your
},
{
    345.44,348.94
     neck, you can use a number of creams, you can use one of the typical Voltaren
},
{
    348.94,353.74
     anti-inflammatory creams and you can use it over the back of the neck, so right
},
{
    353.74,358.06
     over the back and down, or you can use if you're into herbal, your herbal creams,
},
{
    358.06,363.94
     your natural creams, you can use Arnica which is a great anti-inflammatory or in
},
{
    363.94,366.08
     Australia we have a physio cream as well,
},
{
    366.08,370.44
     which is also another natural cream. All these creams are anti-inflammatory creams and they
},
{
    370.44,375.28
     can go over the neck and through into the back of the shoulders and you can just gently massage
},
{
    375.28,380.6
     them in and you can be using those up to four times a day and using them in combination
},
{
    380.6,387.6
     with your heat. So you can see we've gone through quite a number of steps. You're going to keep your pain medication up during the course of the
},
{
    387.6,392.4
     day, regularly apply your heat and you can be doing those neck exercises that I
},
{
    392.4,397.56
     showed you with the heat pack every hour, just progressively rolling and then
},
{
    397.56,401.32
     moving into sitting if you can and doing your rotations and your chin down to your
},
{
    401.32,406.0
     chest. Then if you can, also applying your creams.
},
{
    406.0,409.94
     And finally, if that nussel spasm might actually release
},
{
    409.94,412.14
     and that actually might be enough to give you a relief
},
{
    412.14,413.64
     and start your neck moving again,
},
{
    413.64,416.42
     and if not, call your regular health practitioner.
},
{
    416.42,418.88
     So I really hope this video has helped you today
},
{
    418.88,420.64
     to manage your neck stiffness.
},
{
    420.64,423.28
     Thanks for watching today, and I'll see you next time.
