},
{
    50.84,51.84
     that.
},
{
    51.84,54.6
     Okay, so let's talk about lists for a second, you guys.
},
{
    54.6,62.22
     So as a doctor of physical therapy, as a postpartum rehab specialist, an important part of rehabbing
},
{
    62.22,66.8
     your body after pregnancy is to do the right types of activity.
},
{
    66.8,70.12
     One of the things that I love the most and one of the things that I recommend to ladies
},
{
    70.12,76.14
     after having a baby the most often is this LISC cardio idea or this low intensity steady
},
{
    76.14,78.56
     state cardio idea.
},
{
    78.56,79.82
     It's great on the body.
},
{
    79.82,84.8
     It's not too stressful and it's a great way to actually burn a bunch of fat calories.
},
{
    84.8,87.4
     We're going to talk more about that here in just a second.
},
{
    87.4,92.32
     This is kind of a piggyback video to the one that I, well I published it last week.
},
{
    92.32,94.56
     I just did it like five minutes ago.
},
{
    94.56,97.72
     I'm just, I'm just trying to smash these out as much as I can.
},
{
    97.72,99.76
     I did one that I published last week, you guys.
},
{
    99.76,102.32
     You can check it out here on my YouTube channel.
},
{
    102.32,103.52
     It's actually equipment free.
},
{
    103.52,105.92
     It's a 30 minute equipment free,
},
{
    105.92,108.72
     post pregnancy, diastasis recti friendly,
},
{
    108.72,109.94
     LIS workout.
},
{
    109.94,110.78
     There you go.
},
{
    110.78,111.8
     That's a mouthful for you.
},
{
    111.8,114.12
     And so this is a little bit different variation today.
},
{
    114.12,116.46
     We're gonna take it down to 20 minutes now.
},
{
    116.46,119.1
     Still gonna be DR, diastasis friendly,
},
{
    119.1,120.88
     still gonna be postpartum friendly,
},
{
    120.88,122.28
     but we're gonna add some weights to it.
},
{
    122.28,124.64
     I wanna talk you guys through each one of these.
},
{
    124.64,128.44
     Let me mention real quick, when we talk about intensity of workouts, you guys have to be
},
{
    128.44,130.04
     monitoring your heart rate.
},
{
    130.04,135.88
     That's the only way that you can see how hard you are working throughout the workout.
},
{
    135.88,140.48
     And then I'm going to share a really easy formula with you where you can actually determine,
},
{
    140.48,145.16
     oh, I was doing a high intensity workout or I was staying in this low intensity
},
{
    145.16,146.16
     range.
},
{
    146.16,150.88
     Now, to figure out what that range is for you, you take the number 220, you subtract
},
{
    150.88,156.32
     your age, I'm 37, 220 minus 37 is 183.
},
{
    156.32,161.8
     Now I'm going to multiply that number by 0.5, I get 92, and then I'm also going to multiply
},
{
    161.8,168.48
     that number by 0.7. I get 128. So in order for this to be a true low intensity,
},
{
    168.48,170.72
     steady state cardio activity,
},
{
    170.72,172.32
     I want to monitor my heart rate.
},
{
    172.32,175.52
     I want it to stay in a 92 to 128 range.
},
{
    175.52,178.24
     That's kind of the 50 to 70%
},
{
    178.24,181.82
     of what we would call your age adjusted maximum heart rate.
},
{
    181.82,184.4
     And so that's the last thing I wanted to mention.
},
{
    184.4,187.76
     If you're following along at home, you're going to take the number 220, subtract your age,
},
{
    187.76,192.84
     multiply that by 0.5, multiply that by 0.7, that will give you a range where you
},
{
    192.84,197.22
     should be able to keep your heart rate for the duration of this workout. And so I
},
{
    197.22,201.72
     hope that helps you guys out. That's kind of my quick list, low intensity, steady
},
{
    201.72,206.52
     state workout advice. If we get higher than that, we're gonna jump into
},
{
    206.52,208.88
     what we would refer to maybe as a hit workout
},
{
    208.88,210.84
     or a high intensity interval workout.
},
{
    212.12,215.22
     Basically, we're just using the wrong fuel source for that.
},
{
    215.22,216.72
     I'm gonna explain more about that
},
{
    216.72,218.12
     as we get into the workout.
},
{
    218.12,221.12
     I just wanted to kind of get that out here at the beginning.
},
{
    221.12,223.36
     And so let's go ahead and let's get this thing started.
},
{
    223.36,224.2
     Let's get warmed up.
},
{
    224.2,226.72
     I've got an interval timer right here.
},
{
    226.72,228.68
     We're gonna start with just a warmup.
},
{
    228.68,232.1
     So what I wanna do is kind of like a curtsy lunge row.
},
{
    232.1,234.16
     Great way to just get the hips warmed up,
},
{
    234.16,235.6
     get the quads warmed up.
},
{
    235.6,236.96
     I push start on the timer.
},
{
    236.96,240.88
     We've got 60 seconds of this pretty easy warmup.
},
{
    240.88,241.88
     And so we're sidestepping.
},
{
    241.88,249.48
     We're getting some lateral hip motion involved. Let me make sure that my, okay so the heart rate's going. I didn't mention to
},
{
    249.48,253.16
     you guys I've got a bunch of heart rate monitors that I love. There's some from
},
{
    253.16,258.48
     Polar, there's Garmin, Apple, even like an Apple Watch makes a great heart rate
},
{
    258.48,263.52
     monitor. But the thing is that I do tell people is that the wrist based heart
},
{
    263.52,269.48
     rate monitor isn't going to be quite as accurate as if you were to wear a chest strap.
},
{
    269.48,273.16
     And so because I wanted to be a little more accurate with this video, because I felt like
},
{
    273.16,276.48
     that was important to be able to share with you guys, I'm actually wearing, I don't know
},
{
    276.48,277.48
     if you can see it.
},
{
    277.48,280.0
     I've actually got a polar heart rate monitor on.
},
{
    280.0,283.24
     It's a polar chest strap that's got a Bluetooth thing.
},
{
    283.24,285.16
     So there's 60 seconds on that warm up, you guys.
},
{
    285.16,286.0
     Let's go ahead.
},
{
    286.0,287.6
     Let's just do like some side step,
},
{
    287.6,288.92
     kind of jumping jacks,
},
{
    288.92,290.62
     get the muscles warmed up overhead.
},
{
    292.12,294.04
     It's a Bluetooth chest strap,
},
{
    294.04,295.18
     talks right to my watch.
},
{
    295.18,297.44
     I don't have to wear any wires or pores or anything,
},
{
    297.44,299.58
     really slick where I can actually see
},
{
    299.58,300.56
     what my heart rates do.
},
{
    300.56,302.52
     So to give you guys an idea, again,
},
{
    302.52,303.8
     oh, that's raised to speak.
},
{
    303.8,304.64
     I don't wanna do that.
},
{
    304.64,307.8
     So to give you guys an idea, again, oh, that's raised to speak. I don't want to do that. So to give you guys an idea, I'm at like 104 right now.
},
{
    307.8,312.36
     Again, I literally just shot another list workout.
},
{
    312.36,314.24
     Just barely, I just barely finished that.
},
{
    314.24,316.16
     And so my heart rate's already pretty high.
},
{
    316.16,323.08
     The purpose of the warmup is to maybe elevate the heart rate a little bit.
},
{
    323.08,325.0
     For me, again, I'm a 37 year old guy.
},
{
    325.68,328.16
     The heart rate that I'm going to shoot for is 92 to 128.
},
{
    328.44,329.88
     If you're older than 37,
},
{
    329.9,331.92
     your heart rate range is going to be a little lower than that.
},
{
    331.96,333.28
     If you're younger than 37,
},
{
    333.52,335.6
     your heart rate range is going to be a little higher than that.
},
{
    335.88,338.66
     I already shared the equation with you. You guys, we got five seconds.
},
{
    338.92,341.24
     There's our warmup. Let's do this. We're going to hit some squats.
},
{
    341.48,349.28
     So grab your weights. I've got 15s. It might be, might be lofty. We'll see. We're going to drop hit some squats. So grab your weights I've got 15's that might be might be lofty we'll see we're gonna drop into some squats so it looks just
},
{
    349.28,353.44
     like that. Weights are right at shoulder height elbows are right in front of me
},
{
    353.44,357.08
     keep your elbows in a nice safe position a lot of people will do these out here
},
{
    357.08,361.04
     you can do that if it's comfortable right here is going to be a lot more
},
{
    361.04,365.24
     comfortable you're gonna drop down into a squat, meaning sit my butt
},
{
    365.24,370.32
     towards the ground. Weight should be on the heels and then I'm going to stand
},
{
    370.32,376.08
     right back up. So let's just like that you guys. We're gonna do a 40-20 interval,
},
{
    376.08,381.36
     meaning we're gonna do 40 seconds of work. Got five seconds left. Looks good you
},
{
    381.36,387.56
     guys. Push strong. Looks just like that. Okay, I followed by a 20
},
{
    387.56,392.24
     second rest. During the rest interval, keep moving. I'm gonna be doing kind of
},
{
    392.24,397.68
     some side steps. Basically the idea is I want to get my heart rate up a little
},
{
    397.68,401.8
     bit and I want to keep it up for the duration of the workout. Let's get the
},
{
    401.8,407.56
     weights again, curl and press. So arms and shoulders, we're gonna biceps curl
},
{
    407.56,409.04
     to an overhead press.
},
{
    409.04,412.0
     Step back so you can see how biceps curl
},
{
    412.0,413.48
     into an overhead press.
},
{
    413.48,416.2
     And 40 seconds is a long time.
},
{
    417.16,419.76
     We're also trying to keep our heart rate
},
{
    419.76,422.44
     in a more of a steady state range.
},
{
    422.44,424.84
     I could go a lot faster than this,
},
{
    424.84,426.2
     but it would spike my heart rate too high.
},
{
    426.36,431.8
     And I'm going to explain the importance of keeping your heart rate maybe a little bit lower
},
{
    432.72,438.02
     here as we go through the workout. So the curl and press you guys. So biceps curl right here,
},
{
    438.18,445.4
     muscles on the front of your arm, into the press right above your head, and then right back down. Three, two, one, good.
},
{
    447.2,449.0
     Important piece of that, keep your core nice and tight.
},
{
    449.0,452.76
     So I want you to keep your core engaged
},
{
    452.76,455.4
     while you're standing, while you're doing that exercise.
},
{
    455.4,459.8
     Next, we're gonna get into some alternating reverse lunges.
},
{
    459.8,461.48
     Again, still holding the dumbbell.
},
{
    461.48,463.16
     I think I mentioned this, I can't remember.
},
{
    463.16,464.28
     I've got 15s.
},
{
    466.04,467.72
     A good number to start with.
},
{
    468.64,471.18
     Most of my patients, again you guys,
},
{
    471.18,474.66
     most of my patients are females, most have just had kids.
},
{
    474.66,478.34
     A good number to start with is even like a five pound weight,
},
{
    478.34,481.0
     even lighter, maybe even like a two or a three.
},
{
    482.2,489.84
     Just start low. The thing that I see a lot of is people will basically just
},
{
    489.84,496.06
     get too aggressive with it, ride out the gate. For this workout, like if it's your first
},
{
    496.06,500.98
     time doing something like this and you grab tens, that might be just a little too much.
},
{
    500.98,505.32
     So keep that in mind. The idea is to get our heart rate into a certain
},
{
    505.32,510.92
     range. To keep it in that range. Oh, workouts paused. I didn't finish it. So
},
{
    510.92,515.2
     right now I'm at 125 you guys. So again that's kind of the higher end of my range.
},
{
    515.2,521.36
     I want to be below 128 is my goal. So I'm still in a good range. 50 to 70% of that
},
{
    521.36,525.78
     age-adjusted maximum heart rate. Let's see, next exercise. We did lunges.
},
{
    525.78,526.62
     Oh, the chest press.
},
{
    526.62,528.42
     Sorry, you guys, get down on the floor.
},
{
    529.54,532.46
     Now we're on our back, knees are bent,
},
{
    532.46,534.14
     elbows out to the side,
},
{
    534.14,536.14
     and we're just gonna press straight up.
},
{
    536.14,539.18
     So you guys, postpartum,
},
{
    539.18,540.78
     I don't want you to do push-ups.
},
{
    542.58,550.16
     If you do have what we'd call a diastasis recti condition or an abdominal separation,
},
{
    550.16,557.48
     I want to keep stress off of your rectus abdominis muscle. That's your six-pack muscle. It's
},
{
    557.48,565.88
     super engaged while you're doing push-ups. So if you can, I would love for you to actually avoid those. One easy
},
{
    565.88,571.68
     convenient way to do that is with the chest press. Getting up from the floor,
},
{
    571.68,577.2
     roll to your side, use your hands to push you up, that kind of avoids the sit-up
},
{
    577.2,580.88
     motion that you would otherwise go through. Chest press, deadlifts are gonna
},
{
    580.88,589.48
     be our next one. This is a great one. You post part of moms out there. Your whole life is down below your knees now and so you're
},
{
    589.48,593.2
     always picking things up. A lot of the women I see complaining about low back
},
{
    593.2,598.0
     pain. This is a great exercise for your low back as long as it's done correctly.
},
{
    598.0,604.36
     My knees are straight. I'm hinging at my hips but my lower back stays flat. I don't
},
{
    604.36,605.2
     want you to round. You'll see how my back lower back stays flat. I don't want you to round.
},
{
    605.2,607.4
     You'll see how my back's rounded right now.
},
{
    607.4,609.68
     I don't want you to try to pull from that position.
},
{
    609.68,612.08
     Keep your back flat, hinge at your hips.
},
{
    612.08,614.44
     So your chest should stay high,
},
{
    614.44,617.52
     and should stay parallel with the floor,
},
{
    617.52,620.32
     not round down towards the floor.
},
{
    620.32,623.8
     Use your glutes to pull yourself back up
},
{
    623.8,625.06
     into that upright position
},
{
    625.38,631.72
     Squeeze your butt at the top of the den. So there's our 40 seconds there. Looking good. You guys we got one more
},
{
    632.16,637.78
     Right one more exercise to get through. I got my exercise list right below my phone right now as I'm recording this
},
{
    638.1,643.4
     Our last one's gonna be some bent over dumbbell rows. Let's grab those again. Let's hit it
},
{
    643.36,644.88
     bent over dumbbell rows. Let's grab those again. Let's hit it.
},
{
    648.8,652.16
     Slight bend in the knee, hinge forward at the hips, weights are in front of you, and then your elbows, you pull your elbows back behind you. Looks just like that.
},
{
    652.16,658.08
     And so from in front to back behind, that's exactly what it looks like, just like that you
},
{
    658.08,666.12
     guys. And we're going to rep those out for the 40 seconds. Okay, and then after that we get a 60 second break.
},
{
    667.8,670.86
     And so as we talk about this LIS activity,
},
{
    672.0,674.64
     all of us are familiar, well, most of us are familiar
},
{
    674.64,677.24
     with what we'd call a HIIT workout,
},
{
    677.24,679.56
     a high intensity interval workout.
},
{
    679.56,684.36
     The idea there is that we're going to spike our heart rate
},
{
    684.36,685.76
     three, two, one.
},
{
    685.76,689.68
     Okay, 60 second break, or actually 20 second low interval
},
{
    689.68,691.8
     and then a 60 second break.
},
{
    691.8,695.88
     The idea behind HIIT is that we're going to spike our
},
{
    695.88,698.68
     heart rate, meaning most literature recommends about
},
{
    698.68,700.82
     80 to 90% of heart rate.
},
{
    700.82,702.88
     We're gonna stay there for a short period of time,
},
{
    702.88,704.6
     20 to 30 seconds.
},
{
    704.6,709.68
     We're then gonna follow that up with a low intensity interval, and we're going to do that
},
{
    709.68,715.68
     for anywhere from 60 to 120 seconds, so one to two minutes. That's what your typical
},
{
    715.68,724.24
     HIIT workout looks like. Now, the idea with LIS is that it's actually just the opposite of that.
},
{
    724.24,727.3
     We're not going to spark spike our heart rate up too high
},
{
    727.46,730.34
     But we're going to keep it at a steady level
},
{
    730.46,737.34
     So during as I go through these intervals as I go for my 40 second work interval, I'm not getting my heart rate up
},
{
    737.34,739.88
     Super high. I'm not in that 80 90% range
},
{
    740.22,745.6
     But as I'm doing my low interval so my 20 second rest break, I'm still moving.
},
{
    745.6,749.8
     I'm not standing there or sitting there sedentarily.
},
{
    749.8,754.06
     My goal is to maintain my heart rate at this certain range.
},
{
    754.06,757.0
     And so right now, you guys, I'm at like a 104.
},
{
    757.0,759.76
     And so it came down a little bit from what I was earlier, but I'm still right in that
},
{
    759.76,760.76
     range.
},
{
    760.76,761.76
     I think earlier, what was it?
},
{
    761.76,762.76
     124, 123.
},
{
    762.76,764.4
     Now I'm in 104 right on the money.
},
{
    764.4,770.4
     Squats, you guys. Here we go. Grab those dumbbells again. They come right in front of you drop down into a squat right back up
},
{
    770.68,772.68
     Looks just like that
},
{
    773.04,775.04
     Okay, so let's talk about
},
{
    776.0,780.92
     Let's talk about macro nutrient metabolism. That sounds like a good topic right and so
},
{
    781.48,787.44
     Food is fuel for your body your body derives fuel from three sources,
},
{
    787.44,789.6
     your macronutrients, your proteins,
},
{
    789.6,792.24
     your fats, and your carbohydrates.
},
{
    792.24,796.64
     Now, during a higher intensity activity,
},
{
    796.64,800.12
     meaning heart rate above 70%,
},
{
    800.12,802.76
     what happens is your body
},
{
    802.76,807.6
     typically can't really consume as much oxygen during that period.
},
{
    807.6,812.8
     It becomes what we call an anaerobic activity, anaerobic meaning without oxygen.
},
{
    813.68,819.12
     When your body's in this anaerobic state, it's going to pull primarily from a carbohydrate for
},
{
    819.12,827.24
     its energy source. Curl and press is the next one, you guys. So here we go, three, two, one. We're gonna curl and we're gonna press.
},
{
    827.24,831.6
     And so when you're in that higher intensity range,
},
{
    831.6,835.44
     your body's primarily burning carbs as its fuel source.
},
{
    835.44,840.44
     Carbs burn hot and fast and are readily available
},
{
    840.6,842.6
     from the food that we consume.
},
{
    842.6,844.82
     Now that's great.
},
{
    844.82,846.66
     And I love HIIT workouts.
},
{
    846.66,848.14
     I love high intensity workouts.
},
{
    848.14,849.38
     I love sweating.
},
{
    849.38,852.06
     I love training like an athlete.
},
{
    852.06,854.22
     I love training at that higher intensity.
},
{
    854.22,858.86
     Feels good to just get in and get a bunch of sweat going.
},
{
    858.86,862.86
     Now, keep in mind though, that as you're doing that,
},
{
    862.86,868.76
     your body is, three, two, one that your body is primarily burning through
},
{
    868.76,874.12
     these carbohydrates for its energy source. Now most of you postpartum moms who
},
{
    874.12,879.36
     come in to see me say I want to lose fat. I want to grab your stomach. I've got
},
{
    879.36,883.56
     10 or 15 pounds of this mommy tummy, this pooch. Let's see reverse lunges,
},
{
    883.56,889.36
     alternating reverse lunges, that I want to get rid of. And so when I look at that I say, okay,
},
{
    889.36,892.6
     well, tell me about your workouts and they'll tell me all about their hip
},
{
    892.6,895.44
     workouts. And then I'll say, okay, well that sounds great, but what are you doing to
},
{
    895.44,899.44
     burn fat? They're like, well I just told you. And I say, well no, everything you
},
{
    899.44,902.44
     told me is gonna burn carbohydrates in your body. What are you doing to burn
},
{
    902.44,908.24
     fat calories? And they kind of look at me confused. And then that's where we have this conversation of the
},
{
    908.24,913.84
     idea between a low intensity workout and a high intensity workout. If I can keep my heart rate
},
{
    914.64,924.72
     below that 70% range, your body has enough oxygen to metabolize fat and to do it efficiently.
},
{
    925.0,925.64
     oxygen to metabolize fat and to do it efficiently.
},
{
    928.88,930.48
     And so that's actually the first energy source that your body goes through,
},
{
    930.48,935.16
     that your body goes to in order to drive energy
},
{
    935.16,937.0
     for whatever work out or for whatever activity
},
{
    937.0,937.96
     that you're doing.
},
{
    937.96,939.84
     Let's see, chest presses are next one.
},
{
    939.84,941.0
     It's not gonna surprise me this time.
},
{
    941.0,942.76
     Three, two, one.
},
{
    944.8,948.96
     Looks just like this now on the floor.
},
{
    948.96,958.12
     So when your heart rate is below 70%, that typically means that there is still an abundance
},
{
    958.12,962.8
     of oxygen. Meaning as I'm doing this workout, you guys have noticed that I've been talking
},
{
    962.8,969.64
     for like, what, 12 minutes now, something like that, and I'm still able to get through this conversation.
},
{
    969.64,973.84
     I'm not short of breath, well maybe I'm a little bit winded, but I don't have to necessarily
},
{
    973.84,978.84
     take breaks in order to get out what I'm trying to tell you guys about.
},
{
    978.84,988.0
     That tells me that I'm in the right range where there's still this abundance of oxygen, where my body is still, again,
},
{
    988.0,991.12
     let's roll to the side and then sit up from there.
},
{
    992.24,994.68
     Tells me that there's still this abundance of oxygen
},
{
    994.68,997.72
     where my body can metabolize my fat molecules
},
{
    997.72,1001.4
     without having to reach into my carbohydrate molecules.
},
{
    1001.4,1003.84
     Okay, three, two, one, deadlifts is our next one.
},
{
    1003.84,1005.78
     So legs are straight, hinge at the hips, pull with the glutes, right, two, one, deadlifts is our next one. So legs are straight, hinge
},
{
    1005.78,1012.18
     at the hips, pull with the glutes, right back up to upright, squeeze the butt at the top.
},
{
    1012.18,1018.02
     And so that's the difference, you guys. If you want to burn fat, if you want to lose
},
{
    1018.02,1024.22
     fat weight, you actually just don't need to work out as hard. It's such a counterintuitive
},
{
    1024.22,1025.68
     thing that people think,
},
{
    1025.68,1030.72
     oh, I'm not losing any weight. I must not be working out hard enough. I need to find more
},
{
    1030.72,1036.24
     time. I need to work out more intensely. I need to add another training session a week.
},
{
    1036.24,1040.88
     It's not always the case, you guys. What I tell people is, let's just mix things up a little bit.
},
{
    1040.88,1050.8
     Let's try to maybe do things a little bit differently and think about it a little bit differently in order to burn up some of those some of the fat that
},
{
    1050.8,1057.56
     you have in your body. So that's the idea behind LIS. We're staying below a 70% heart
},
{
    1057.56,1063.76
     rate range. I don't want mine to be above 128. I'm at 121 right now. 3, 2, that was the
},
{
    1063.76,1065.12
     deadlift. Bend over rows as our next one
},
{
    1065.12,1071.6
     is. So hips are tight, knees are bent, weights in front, weights back behind. So I'm pulling,
},
{
    1071.6,1077.2
     I'm getting my elbows back behind my body, retracting those weights right up into my chest.
},
{
    1077.2,1082.56
     Looks just like that. Great exercise for your lower back. Lower back has to be stable and support
},
{
    1083.2,1090.16
     while I'm doing this. Also great for your upper back as your idea is the goal is to pull your shoulder blades together
},
{
    1090.56,1093.34
     So it looks just like that you guys looking good looking strong
},
{
    1095.0,1097.0
     Just got about 10 seconds left
},
{
    1098.64,1102.24
     Looks good you guys I apologize if you can hear my family upstairs
},
{
    1102.24,1107.0
     I usually don't film on a Saturday when everybody's around,
},
{
    1107.0,1113.0
     but I kind of had to get these videos published a little bit sooner off my usual schedule.
},
{
    1113.0,1118.0
     So you can hear people banging around upstairs. I do apologize. Don't leave me a negative comment for that.
},
{
    1118.0,1130.12
     I'm just a dad. Just a dad trying to make it, you guys. Aren't we all right? Aren't we all just parents, spouses, boyfriend, girlfriend, brother, sister, whatever, whatever relation you
},
{
    1130.12,1134.48
     might have. We're just trying to make it. So here we go you guys, looking good. So
},
{
    1134.48,1139.84
     now this is our second rest break. This is gonna be our second 60 second rest
},
{
    1139.84,1152.08
     break. I'm kind of doing the March thing. I'm a 114 heart rate right now. Just because I'm a little OCD. I'm gonna check my camera real quick. Okay cool.
},
{
    1152.08,1156.32
     Looks like it's still going. I can't tell you guys. There's no more
},
{
    1156.32,1160.6
     devastating feeling than you know you do a 30 minute workout and you find out
},
{
    1160.6,1166.78
     that your camera turned off automatically after like five minutes. You have no footage to use for it.
},
{
    1167.3,1169.08
     So here we go, you guys.
},
{
    1169.08,1171.24
     We've got one more round to get through.
},
{
    1171.24,1176.74
     Again, there's a 20 minute list workout, low intensity, steady state workout,
},
{
    1176.8,1179.08
     keeping my heart rate between 50 and 70 percent.
},
{
    1179.44,1180.34
     I've got some weights.
},
{
    1180.34,1182.1
     It's a great way to kick it up the level.
},
{
    1182.1,1183.6
     We're actually doing some strength training.
},
{
    1183.6,1184.74
     Let's see, squats.
},
{
    1184.74,1187.68
     We're actually doing some strength training. Let's see, squats. We're actually hitting some strength training
},
{
    1187.68,1190.14
     with the cardio activity.
},
{
    1191.56,1192.88
     They are intervals.
},
{
    1192.88,1194.96
     We're doing a 40 second work interval.
},
{
    1194.96,1197.72
     We're doing a 20 second rest interval.
},
{
    1197.72,1199.24
     That was my quotation fingers, you guys.
},
{
    1199.24,1204.24
     Rest interval, because it is still a light work period.
},
{
    1205.0,1205.16
     I'm not going as hard on my work interval as I could. interval because it is still a light work period.
},
{
    1208.96,1211.6
     I'm not going as hard on my work interval as I could. I mean, I could be, you know, if we come here
},
{
    1211.6,1213.26
     and we really smash it out,
},
{
    1213.26,1215.68
     that's gonna get my heart rate up a little too high
},
{
    1215.68,1218.2
     and I'm not gonna fall within that range.
},
{
    1218.2,1221.28
     And so keep that in mind while you're doing these activities,
},
{
    1221.28,1223.96
     squats, knees are over toes, weights on heels,
},
{
    1223.96,1225.72
     pushing with the butt, pushing with the quads.
},
{
    1226.28,1227.88
     It was just like that.
},
{
    1227.88,1232.24
     And so you see, I kind of wrapped out, you know, a little faster.
},
{
    1232.36,1236.76
     Some of those, some of those reps, I've got a 137 on my heart rate right now.
},
{
    1237.24,1239.24
     So it tells me, and again, I'm a little more winded.
},
{
    1240.2,1241.72
     Tells me that I just pushed it a little too hard.
},
{
    1241.72,1245.28
     And so we're going to do what we can to bring that back down.
},
{
    1252.96,1253.68
     One, oh sorry, let's see, uh the curl and press. So curl and press. And one way to do that is to just slow down.
},
{
    1257.28,1257.92
     And so if I just kind of take this down, if I slow it down a little bit,
},
{
    1264.64,1266.48
     basically the way that you're going to vary your intensity is based on speed. If I go faster, I'm gonna raise my heart rate.
},
{
    1266.48,1270.44
     If I go slower, I can drop my heart rate down. I'm gonna check my heart rate for
},
{
    1270.44,1275.0
     you guys again right after I do this. I got 12 seconds left. Looks good you guys.
},
{
    1275.0,1280.52
     Bicep curl. So biceps muscles on the front, shoulder press, muscles on the top of
},
{
    1280.52,1285.12
     your arm. Just like that you guys are getting one more three two one and back down.
},
{
    1286.88,1294.32
     Okay so heart rate oh still too high 137 138. Ciri keeps thinking that I want to talk to her I
},
{
    1294.32,1298.48
     don't want to talk to you Ciri I'm simply trying to check my heart rate so I'm gonna slow down a
},
{
    1298.48,1306.0
     little bit bring it down to where I want it to be there's 130 129 128 127 that's where I want it to be. There's 130, 129, 128, 127. That's where I want it to be. Okay.
},
{
    1306.0,1310.12
     So let's see the lunges is their next one, you guys, after the curl press.
},
{
    1310.12,1314.32
     So the reverse lunge and then back up. So that is one question that I get in my
},
{
    1314.32,1319.48
     group a lot. How do I bring my heart rate down? Just slow down. Slow down the
},
{
    1319.48,1325.0
     intensity. Some other great list options include walking is a great one.
},
{
    1327.44,1329.98
     If it's wintertime, if you're stuck inside,
},
{
    1329.98,1332.04
     stairs, you walk up and down the stairs.
},
{
    1333.04,1334.84
     At home workouts like this,
},
{
    1334.84,1337.14
     a stationary bike is a great one.
},
{
    1337.14,1338.76
     If it's summertime and the weather's nice,
},
{
    1338.76,1340.2
     go outside and ride your bike.
},
{
    1341.54,1345.0
     My wife and I, we love to take a walk with our kids.
},
{
    1345.12,1347.12
     That's a great way to do it.
},
{
    1347.12,1349.36
     She's funny, she'll even clean the house.
},
{
    1349.36,1352.46
     You know, she'll wear her watch.
},
{
    1352.46,1353.76
     Let's see, 130 you guys.
},
{
    1353.76,1357.24
     So I'm right on that high level of my range,
},
{
    1357.24,1360.7
     she'll wear her watch while she cleans the house
},
{
    1360.7,1363.48
     and just tries to clean a little more vigorously.
},
{
    1363.48,1374.68
     Let's see, the chest press. Here we go. And so like you know we have we have two kids who have rooms upstairs
},
{
    1374.68,1381.0
     and so she'll like take their laundry up to their room two things at a time and
},
{
    1381.0,1386.56
     treat that as a less activity workout. So she's running up and down the stairs, she's,
},
{
    1386.56,1393.04
     you know, squatting down into drawers, she's reaching up for hangers on clothes rods. You know,
},
{
    1393.04,1397.76
     there's ways to do it. It's really easy because all you've got to do is get your heart rate up a
},
{
    1397.76,1406.84
     little bit and then keep it there. I recommend that you do at least like 30 minutes a day. I say it for my group.
},
{
    1406.84,1408.48
     So again, I'm gonna roll out this.
},
{
    1409.48,1411.32
     It looks just like this, roll to your side
},
{
    1411.32,1413.48
     and then come up from there.
},
{
    1413.48,1417.28
     For the group, I tell them we need to do 30 minutes of less
},
{
    1417.28,1418.98
     most days of the week.
},
{
    1418.98,1421.84
     So four days is great, five days is better,
},
{
    1421.84,1424.28
     six days, seven days is the best.
},
{
    1424.28,1425.04
     30 minutes of this less activity, dead lifts six days, seven days is the best. 30 minutes of this
},
{
    1425.04,1430.14
     LIS activity, deadlifts you guys, most days of the week. And that's not too hard
},
{
    1430.14,1433.04
     for most people to get in. That doesn't take a whole lot, you just have to be a
},
{
    1433.04,1438.36
     little creative with it. So it looks like that you guys, deadlifts, straight legs,
},
{
    1438.36,1446.32
     hinge at my hips, pull with my glutes, my back's nice and flat, and my intensity, I can tell my intensity is right on
},
{
    1446.32,1452.48
     because I'm able to talk to you guys. I've got plenty of oxygen for my body to metabolize those
},
{
    1452.48,1458.16
     fat molecules without reaching into that carbohydrate store. And so that's what we're after,
},
{
    1458.16,1465.0
     you guys, just like that. Six seconds left. Five, four, looks good. 2, 1.
},
{
    1465.0,1466.0
     Last one, you guys.
},
{
    1466.0,1469.0
