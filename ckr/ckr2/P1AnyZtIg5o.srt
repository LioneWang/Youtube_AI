     Hi I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist Brad Heineck physical therapist and together we have the most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    7.0,9.0
     In our opinion of course Bob
},
{
    9.0,13.0
     Okay Brad today we're going to talk about that thing you just threw on the ground which is a night's splint
},
{
    13.0,19.0
     And actually this could be a very helpful device for a couple of problems that you may be having
},
{
    19.0,23.0
     One is plantar fasciitis
},
{
    23.0,26.04
     Oh you want me to say plantar fasciitis? Another one would be
},
{
    26.04,30.88
     maybe if you have any trouble with your heel cord. Yep heel cord or the calf muscle.
},
{
    30.88,37.6
     Achilles tendon or the calf muscle, tendocalcaneus. Sure. I'm gonna say some
},
{
    37.6,45.52
     professional verbiage. Okay what do we got going here Brad? Okay, you're gonna want to use this if
},
{
    45.52,51.92
     here are the symptoms you have pain in your foot, around your ankle, in your
},
{
    51.92,56.32
     calf, when you get out of bed and the first thing you do when you put weight on
},
{
    56.32,61.12
     there is you go, ow, and it hurts and after you walk around for a while it
},
{
    61.12,69.36
     becomes less and less painful and you can start to walk normal but it's very it's very specific when you first put weight on that foot
},
{
    69.36,75.96
     it is very uncomfortable shockingly right okay if that's your symptoms then
},
{
    75.96,80.44
     you're gonna be helped with one of these devices okay now I'll let you lay down
},
{
    80.44,89.52
     about here put your foot on just a foot So what happens is when you sleep, I don't normally wear a white sock. I just want to, I wore a white sock
},
{
    89.52,95.2
     just for you today Brad. No Bob, he's a geek really. He wears them all the time. Okay, when you sleep
},
{
    95.2,100.72
     the foot planter flexes or points down like this typically, okay. The tissues from here,
},
{
    101.44,105.76
     let's rotate this way Bob, just imagine the tissues from here are all
},
{
    105.76,109.4
     connected to the heel and all the way up to the bottom of the knee and they really
},
{
    109.4,115.76
     are just that you know there's okay so we've got the calf muscle to the Achilles tendon
},
{
    115.76,119.8
     to the heel, the heel to the plantar fasciitis to the toes and all of that so
},
{
    119.8,123.64
     what happens is over the nighttime if these are injured in such a way they
},
{
    123.64,128.88
     will tighten up and heal during the nighttime. So in the morning they've tightened up and
},
{
    128.88,133.68
     your foot wants to stay plantar flexor pointed down and when you stand on it all
},
{
    133.68,138.48
     this goes up quickly and all those sore muscles and tender tissues get
},
{
    138.48,143.76
     stretching a big hurry which causes a lot of pain. Well I think it can maybe even
},
{
    143.76,147.68
     re-tear and if you're getting some I think it can maybe even re-tear. And if you're getting some healing going on,
},
{
    147.68,148.96
     it may even re-tear.
},
{
    148.96,150.88
     And also you have to start the healing process
},
{
    150.88,151.72
     all over again.
},
{
    151.72,155.4
     So it creates a chronic problem which goes on forever.
},
{
    155.4,157.48
     So what you wanna do is when you sleep,
},
{
    157.48,160.32
     is hold your foot up in a neutral position.
},
{
    160.32,161.8
     And that's gonna be pretty hard to do.
},
{
    161.8,163.32
     If you think about that when you're sleeping,
},
{
    163.32,164.44
     you're really good.
},
{
    164.44,168.84
     So what you need is a neck splint and neutral position is basically a right angle
},
{
    169.08,171.76
     This and this forms a right angle
},
{
    171.76,176.94
     Okay, the normal position like that this will hold it up like that, right?
},
{
    177.36,178.44
     Okay
},
{
    178.44,184.32
     Now this is no kidding if you don't have a night splint and you don't want to spend the money have the money
},
{
    184.32,190.46
     I had a doctor that I work with and he did this he took a pair of high-top tennis shoes
},
{
    190.46,195.02
     And he wore them to bed at night because it's kept his feet in that 90 degree position and it works
},
{
    195.72,200.64
     This these work a little bit better. They're a little more comfortable. I used to do that
},
{
    200.64,203.64
     We actually with some of our stroke patients even. Oh really?
},
{
    203.64,206.0
     I didn't wear the the high top tennis shoes.
},
{
    206.0,207.0
     Sure.
},
{
    207.0,210.0
     I'm not going to tighten this up on Bob just because I don't want to take the time for the video,
},
{
    210.0,216.0
     but the straps go across, get in the heel down in, okay, and then you can adjust a lot of these,
},
{
    216.0,221.0
     on the better ones, you can adjust the amount of dorsiflexion or where you put the foot,
},
{
    221.0,225.0
     okay, and that's what these Velcro straps are here for.
},
{
    225.0,230.84
     Obviously I would probably put it as tight as it's still comfortable. I can sleep with it,
},
{
    230.84,234.64
     but I want to put as much stretch on it as I can tolerate. What did you say Brad?
},
{
    234.64,238.52
     But yeah again it's got to be comfortable. It's got to be comfortable because you can't sleep
},
{
    238.52,242.96
     otherwise. Exactly you should be able to sleep. Because I actually feel a little bit of stretch
},
{
    242.96,246.64
     on my calf right here just with this being on I
},
{
    246.64,249.66
     Think I can sleep with this but it I mean I feel it
},
{
    250.16,256.32
     Yeah, it's and if it is you can loosen it up a little right because I mean you might find out like I just can't sleep
},
{
    256.32,260.7
     It's stretching too much and go ahead you can do this over the period of several nights
},
{
    260.7,268.76
     Right where you try to incrementally bring it up sure and further and you will find a difference, a difference when you get out of bed
},
{
    268.76,273.52
     without this and then the next night with it is going to be much less pain
},
{
    273.52,277.92
     when you stand behind. And optimally hopefully what's going to happen eventually
},
{
    277.92,282.96
     is that it'll help it heal quicker. You're not going in that cycle of
},
{
    282.96,288.06
     breaking over open the scar tissue and having to restart the healing process
},
{
    288.06,290.48
     Now there's one thing as a therapist
},
{
    290.48,297.08
     I know I cause problems between spalous allanes, you know if you put one of these on they kick the person next to you and that
},
{
    297.08,303.56
     It can cause arguments, we do not want to have none of that going on as a result of our suggestions
