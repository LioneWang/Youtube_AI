     At some time when we least expect it, we may encounter a victim of an accident or illness that becomes unconscious.

     Hi, I'm Captain Joe Bruni. What we're going to talk about is how to assess the airway, breathing, and circulation in the unconscious or conscious victim.
},
{
    26.88,31.4
     We approach the victim and make sure that the scene is safe, first and foremost, and kneel next to the patient if they're lying in this position.
},
{
    31.4,37.48
     The very next thing we'll do as long as we don't suspect a neck or cervical spine injury
},
{
    37.48,47.48
     is to tilt the head back and using the chin lift technique to open the airway. We will then go down and look, listen, and feel,
},
{
    47.48,50.92
     looking for chest rise, feeling against our cheek
},
{
    50.92,53.12
     for the exchange of air or breathing,
},
{
    53.12,55.3
     and listening for the exchange of air.
},
{
    57.26,59.12
     If there is no exchange of air,
},
{
    59.12,62.1
     rescue breaths may be in order.
},
{
    62.1,67.0
     After the airway is assessed, to assess circulation, we place two fingers
},
{
    67.1,72.48
     alongside the neck, feeling for the carotid artery, to determine if the person has circulation
},
{
    72.48,79.48
     or pulse. If we're determining circulation on an infant, we would check the area between
},
{
    79.48,88.28
     the elbow and the armpit, known as the brachial artery, again using two fingers. Do not use the thumb to assess circulation
},
{
    88.28,92.76
     as the thumb has its own pulse in it. Two fingers
},
{
    92.76,95.52
     is the way to check circulation. So again,
},
{
    95.52,99.72
     ABC's of airway breathing and circulation are
},
{
    99.72,102.88
     head tilt, chin lift, look, listen, and feel,
},
{
    102.88,106.12
     and then feel for the carotid pulse to determine
},
{
    106.12,108.12
     if they're circulation.
},
{
    108.12,111.12
     I'm Captain Joe Bruni, stay safe and we'll see you next time.
