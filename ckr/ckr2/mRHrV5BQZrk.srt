     Bob and Brad the two most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    9.16,14.84
     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist, Brad Heineck physical therapist, we are the most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    14.84,19.56
     And our opinion of course Bob, Napoleon is probably wondering why we didn't introduce him Napoleon Bone Apart
},
{
    19.56,21.98
     That's our own joke, that's really bad. Today Brad
},
{
    21.98,25.44
     We're gonna talk about the one thing that may be causing your patellofemoral pain
},
{
    25.68,30.96
     Stop it now stop it stop it. Yeah, so we're talking about knee pain Bob right right there
},
{
    30.96,35.88
     And we'll talk about a little bit of what that is, but normally just like any other joint of the body
},
{
    36.32,38.96
     You know, it's just not there in by itself
},
{
    39.08,42.96
     It's being affected by the hip and the ankle what you're doing there, right?
},
{
    42.96,46.52
     And today we're gonna actually talk about how the hip can affect what's going on at your knee.
},
{
    46.52,51.08
     But before we do that Brad, this time is now isn't it? If you are new to our
},
{
    51.08,54.52
     channel please take a second to subscribe to us, come on in, we provide
},
{
    54.52,58.0
     videos on how to stay healthy, fit, pain-free, and we upload every day. Also go
},
{
    58.0,61.12
     over to the Facebook and like us because Brad and I, as children, we're not
},
{
    61.12,64.32
     liked, it's a sad story but we're trying to turn things around.
},
{
    64.32,65.84
     Why Bob? Let's working, it's working
},
{
    65.84,72.1
     Let's get on with it. So patella femoral pain, that's that knee pain that you feel it's a general achiness
},
{
    72.84,76.22
     A lot of times it feels like it's right behind the kneecap because it is
},
{
    76.22,80.68
     Yeah, I've seen it where it is around the knee that people describe it again
},
{
    80.68,84.44
     It's kind of adult ache it just keeps going on a lot of times worse with stairs
},
{
    84.44,85.68
     Again, it's kind of a dull ache. It just keeps going on a lot of times worse with stairs
},
{
    90.4,96.7
     Running anything where you're putting a little more weight on the knee getting up to stand Right, yeah, so that motion going down the stairs a lot of times that's worse than going up
},
{
    96.7,103.28
     And you feel sometimes you feel like a grinding or kind of a clicking noise even sometimes and it may be grinding
},
{
    103.28,108.16
     Yeah, right. So what is happening here? Let's Lonnie if you want to come on in closer
},
{
    108.16,111.84
     Our hip is a little tight here too, we got to mobilize that
},
{
    111.84,115.92
     So we got the femoral joint, the femur and we got the tibia
},
{
    115.92,118.96
     And you see there's actually a little groove here, I don't know if you could point that
},
{
    118.96,123.28
     out Brad with the kneecap, it doesn't just sit there
},
{
    123.28,126.44
     It actually moves up and down when you're bending and extending the kneecap it doesn't just sit there it actually moves up and down when you're bending and extending the knee
},
{
    126.84,130.98
     And normally it wants to you know fit right into that groove and glide up and down
},
{
    131.3,137.24
     But if you do something like turn your knee Brad's gonna demonstrate this if you bend your knee in
},
{
    137.88,144.68
     So you're not need or valgus. I got the tape on here so you can see that when you get that angle
},
{
    144.68,148.16
     I'm exaggerating a little bit although we've seen people with that bad.
},
{
    148.16,151.88
     That's true but you don't have to be this bad in order to get this problem.
},
{
    151.88,156.28
     Now one way that this happens though is the hip is turning in, it's internally
},
{
    156.28,162.06
     rotating and why does that happen? Weak muscles, weak hip muscles and I see it in
},
{
    162.06,166.28
     a lot of women and that's why I think you see a little more patello femoral problems in women
},
{
    166.28,169.56
     But what that causes is now coming back down here Lonnie
},
{
    170.26,175.66
     You got it? Okay. What that causes the kneecap is gonna ride a little more over onto the side
},
{
    175.66,181.16
     And it's gonna ride on this sharp edge and it's gonna wear out the back of the other side of the patella
},
{
    181.16,186.16
     And we get chondromalasia or or a softening under the edge and that hurts
},
{
    186.8,191.12
     It's kind of like producing some arthritic changes in there in that surface
},
{
    191.24,193.52
     So we want to yeah very good Brad
},
{
    193.52,199.48
     So we want to strengthen the muscles that are gonna stop the hip from turning in we're gonna pull it back out again
},
{
    199.48,205.8
     So that's what these these exercises do here and we did this in three minutes. We usually take five minutes
},
{
    205.8,209.2
     We're getting better. We watch those comments
},
{
    210.48,216.72
     Brad while I'm showing the clam shells, do you want to get a band around you and get ready for you?
},
{
    216.72,218.72
     You want to band me?
},
{
    219.68,221.68
     Listen to the band
},
{
    221.76,225.6
     Okay, so the first one we're going to do is a clamshell.
},
{
    225.6,232.4
     It's very simple because we're working the external rotators of the hip and this one
},
{
    232.4,234.32
     works really well.
},
{
    234.32,238.56
     It describes kind of what you're doing by the way because you're bringing your legs
},
{
    238.56,242.88
     and your knees together like this and you're just working and it looks like a clam doesn't
},
{
    242.88,243.88
     it Brad?
},
{
    243.88,244.88
     Clamshell.
},
{
    244.88,247.82
     Now you're going to be surprised if you haven't done these
},
{
    248.36,254.46
     You won't need any extra resistance to start off with because mine actually I must not do these Brad.
},
{
    254.46,260.54
     I do hip strengthening, but I don't do these and I'm already feeling it on my legs.
},
{
    260.54,263.36
     Of course Bob. So what would you say Brad for sets?
},
{
    264.04,266.32
     Sets 10 to 15, 3 sets.
},
{
    266.32,271.64
     3 sets and I'll take the breather, I don't know how many I did there but it was enough
},
{
    271.64,276.62
     for me and now I can go ahead and do another set of 10 to 15 and you could
},
{
    276.62,284.24
     do that even well at least once a day right? Yep once a day. It all depends
},
{
    284.24,288.86
     on the condition of the person. Ass assuming those muscles are weak we want to start with wantson
},
{
    288.86,293.9
     Brad's got a band around him. We got the Sankt band. We'll have those listed down below
},
{
    294.68,300.16
     They're just a nice loop that you can put around and it'll work with all these exercises we're doing
},
{
    300.34,302.34
     So Brad do you want to show?
},
{
    302.48,306.44
     With the band on? So it's gonna be tougher now, isn't it? Yeah, this is gonna
},
{
    306.44,312.12
     Oh, I got your mic again. Do you want to go the other side? No, well I want to face, they want to see the front of me Bob
},
{
    312.12,315.08
     I felt it, I don't know. Okay, so again
},
{
    317.04,325.76
     Heal on heel and yeah, oh yeah, that's gonna work. That's gonna work you hard. It works at posterior fibers of the
},
{
    326.6,330.16
     Abductor and the gluteus maximus and what else we got in there?
},
{
    330.16,334.88
     I don't know if the minimus and the medius, they'd kick in for the external rotators
},
{
    337.36,339.76
     Yeah, I can feel it specifically. Pure formus.
},
{
    343.2,349.76
     Anybody, you know, anatomy people just chime in on a comment if we missed one. What about the obstrator?
},
{
    350.48,352.48
     Obstrator?
},
{
    354.04,359.2
     Bringing back our memory now, okay Brad, I'll show the next one now
},
{
    359.64,363.48
     This next one is probably a little graphic, but this is exactly what it is
},
{
    363.48,365.6
     It's called the fire hydrant and it looks like a dog
},
{
    366.28,368.28
     found his way up to a fire hydrant and
},
{
    368.76,374.76
     We're gonna go ahead and do his thing. Yeah, we're gonna bring it up like this. Yeah, let me point this out Bob
},
{
    375.64,379.72
     This is one of those common exercises you'll see in
},
{
    380.24,384.16
     Fitness classes you're down there working that hip muscle right there
},
{
    384.16,386.68
     So again you're getting some external rotation here
},
{
    386.68,388.68
     And you're getting some abduction
},
{
    388.68,395.76
     Again the idea is to get this to straight note which is gonna help that kneecap in the groove. If you're an athlete
},
{
    396.84,401.12
     You play volleyball and stuff like that and you've been landing with your knees kind of coming together
},
{
    401.54,405.1
     You're gonna be more prone to these type of things and in basketball too
},
{
    405.1,409.56
     So there's a lot of sports where we actually try to teach the person to land right
},
{
    410.14,415.42
     When they're jumping, otherwise it also even more prone to other some other injuries
},
{
    415.82,420.7
     And Bob mentioned females have this a little bit more and the reason is because
},
{
    421.1,423.74
     Typically females their hips are inherently a little bit wider
},
{
    424.34,428.64
     is because typically females their hips are inherently a little bit wider so it makes that cue angle that we're talking about a little more prone. You
},
{
    428.64,432.44
     want to do that with the band? You want to try it? Yeah Bob I want to.
},
{
    432.44,436.36
     Here we go. You want to have the pointer stick?
},
{
    436.36,440.72
     I'm just tying my shoe while you're working. Be careful with that. That's
},
{
    440.72,444.74
     the only thing I got to say. Let me get these glasses off. Careful tying my shoe?
},
{
    444.74,450.04
     Yeah, whatever. Just be careful. this stage. You got to be careful doing everything Bob
},
{
    450.04,453.8
     There we go working the hip the working the hip external rotators and again
},
{
    453.8,456.94
     That's gonna be a lot more difficult with the band the bands come in
},
{
    457.68,462.48
     Different levels of difficulty you have the is that the peach one that usually yeah
},
{
    463.92,470.52
     But still I know it's not that easy overall. And then you know, you can work different directions too if you want to as well.
},
{
    470.92,474.08
     Boom, boom, you can come up this way and it adds that resistance.
},
{
    474.08,479.06
     If you want to get them all in there. One thing I would not do is I wouldn't wear this to the office.
},
{
    479.32,483.26
     Right, yeah, not to work. People will talk even more about you than they did before.
},
{
    483.26,485.26
     Do I need it on some more? People will talk even more about you than they did before
},
{
    490.0,493.34
     What's that? Do I need this some more? Yeah, okay, because you were talking about with squats you could use them right? Oh, yeah, so you can start doing some squats now with squats
},
{
    493.34,497.68
     You're gonna really want to make sure things are lined up here, so you want to show up Brad when I'm squatting?
},
{
    497.68,501.0
     Oh, I'll hold on to this and you show it with this. Yeah, that's the balance
},
{
    501.64,505.14
     When you're over 50 you need balance stuff, so you can squat now
},
{
    505.14,507.22
     I don't want the knees to go past the feet
},
{
    510.12,513.72
     So I gotta work on worry about that, but I also don't want to do this
},
{
    514.76,518.38
     So this is where you got to really work on keeping the knees right over the toes
},
{
    519.04,523.28
     You know, good body mechanics, keep that patella in the groove
},
{
    523.88,528.42
     What I like to use for doing this which makes it a lot easier, do you mind just sliding this down Brad?
},
{
    529.12,534.22
     And this isn't gonna work completely because I don't have a real good wall here, but I can kind of demonstrate or
},
{
    534.94,540.1
     Symbolize it is that if you have the ball on the wall and I'm gonna do squats now
},
{
    540.1,546.56
     Now it's really easy to keep my feet in front of my knees and all I have to concentrate on is keeping the knees
},
{
    547.08,550.18
     Out and not in like this. Don't let them get through that
},
{
    551.06,557.1
     Bowling in. And what's nice about this Brad with the ball then you can eventually work on one-legged squats
},
{
    557.1,563.88
     And the same thing again, I'm gonna keep the knee out and it's gonna take a lot more strength to do this
},
{
    563.88,565.56
     And if you're a real good athlete
},
{
    565.56,569.76
     You can start using weights on the side and start doing single leg squats with them.
},
{
    569.76,575.08
     We're gonna advance people. So give a demonstration of how the wrong way to do it.
},
{
    575.08,581.72
     Okay, so let's say with both even a lot of people do this. They land even when they're jumping they land like this.
},
{
    581.72,586.52
     The knees come together. I see a lot of ladies all the time even in volleyball
},
{
    586.52,589.28
     They go like this and they want to go like this
},
{
    589.96,596.12
     So that's really important again that's gonna stop that knee from coming in also you're gonna be less likely to get injured
},
{
    596.12,599.52
     It is statistically I think it's
},
{
    600.84,606.0
     Female basketball players in high school have the highest rate of ACL injuries
},
{
    606.4,614.12
     Which can be related to this that land. Now you were gonna show that the squat with the band on. Oh, yeah
},
{
    614.12,619.64
     I mean so yeah, you can get the band on and like this and then
},
{
    620.0,624.28
     Just hold on and if you wanted to do a double, you know, this is for the more advanced
},
{
    624.28,626.2
     Sure, now you're getting a little double workout
},
{
    630.2,634.2
     So I'm working quadriceps and those muscles and I'm
},
{
    635.08,638.52
     Concentrating and I'm not going into here. I'm keeping them in line here
},
{
    638.52,641.56
     What I like about this Brad is you're teaching the muscle to fire
},
{
    641.82,645.6
     You know when it goes down like that you're teaching that muscle to fire at the same time
},
{
    645.6,648.4
     Right so you're training it, yeah exactly
},
{
    648.4,654.5
     It's not just exercising, there's a difference between exercising and training, we don't have to get into this now
},
{
    654.5,661.02
     But that's what we're doing there, it makes it therapeutic Bob. Alright Brad, I think we can wrap it up
},
{
    661.02,None
     Yeah, let's do so. Thank you everybody for watching. You bet
},
