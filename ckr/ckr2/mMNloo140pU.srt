     Today we have another video from Dr. David Oliver,
},
{
    3.04,5.5
     where he's gonna be talking to you all about
},
{
    5.5,9.82
     herniated discs, the causes of herniated and bulging discs,
},
{
    9.82,13.0
     as well as the symptoms you will feel if you have them,
},
{
    13.0,14.74
     as well as some of the treatment options
},
{
    14.74,18.52
     you can explore on your own to treat them from your home.
},
{
    18.52,19.92
     So when we talk about a herniated disc,
},
{
    19.92,21.4
     we have to look at the actual structure
},
{
    21.4,22.28
     that's involved here.
},
{
    22.28,24.36
     So we're talking about the intervertebral disc,
},
{
    24.36,26.52
     which is the disc that separates the
},
{
    26.52,28.6
     two bones in the spine.
},
{
    28.6,32.64
     So if we look at a model of the spine, you know, we have the different sections of the
},
{
    32.64,33.64
     spine.
},
{
    33.64,35.16
     We have our cervical spine, which is our neck.
},
{
    35.16,37.2
     We have our thoracic spine, which is our mid-back.
},
{
    37.2,39.12
     And then we have our lumbar spine, which is our low back.
},
{
    39.12,43.08
     So we're focused right now on this low back, this lumbar spine.
},
{
    43.08,44.8
     And if we look at the spine itself, we have the bones.
},
{
    44.8,46.96
     We have the vertebrae here, which is this white one,
},
{
    46.96,47.92
     and another one below it.
},
{
    47.92,50.88
     In between that, we have this tan color material
},
{
    50.88,53.0
     that's called your intervertebral disc.
},
{
    53.0,56.0
     And the way to think about an intervertebral disc
},
{
    56.0,57.64
     is it's like a big jelly donut.
},
{
    57.64,59.88
     So the outside's semi-firm,
},
{
    59.88,62.16
     and inside is a jelly-like material.
},
{
    62.16,65.56
     If we get enough damage to that outer ring of that disc,
},
{
    65.56,68.72
     that jelly-like material can start to squirt its way out.
},
{
    68.72,71.24
     This is not good because that jelly-like material
},
{
    71.24,73.08
     is not designed to be in those areas.
},
{
    73.08,76.0
     This can cause the symptoms of a herniated disc.
},
{
    76.0,78.0
     Unfortunately, herniated discs are very common
},
{
    78.0,81.08
     in society nowadays, and there's a variety of reasons for that.
},
{
    81.08,84.52
     The number one way to irritate a disc is flexion.
},
{
    84.52,85.04
     So basically flexion, if I were to irritate a disc is flexion. So basically
},
{
    85.04,89.48
     flexion, if I were to flex forward, this is flexion. So if we're to take the spine
},
{
    89.48,92.44
     model again and demonstrate that, if you were to look at the spine from the side
},
{
    92.44,97.24
     and you took, looked at this lower back and you flexed it forward, essentially
},
{
    97.24,100.44
     this front area of the spine you're compressing which pushes all the
},
{
    100.44,104.48
     material backwards. If you get enough compression and enough load, it's actually
},
{
    104.48,107.16
     going to cause a bulge or herniation at this back side of the
},
{
    107.16,113.88
     disc. So repeated flexion we find to be the most problematic for these spines. The
},
{
    113.88,117.6
     most common time you're flexing that spine is what you're doing right now,
},
{
    117.6,122.36
     sitting. Sitting is flexion. Every time we sit down, we flex our lower spine a
},
{
    122.36,128.28
     little bit. Studies have actually shown just sitting, even with with great posture will increase the pressure in that disc 50%.
},
{
    128.28,131.72
     You sit with poor posture you can increase it up over a hundred percent of
},
{
    131.72,135.68
     what it normally is. Repeated flexion, repeated sitting is going to weaken that
},
{
    135.68,139.52
     disc over time which is going to cause a disc bulge, can cause a herniation. The
},
{
    139.52,143.4
     most common symptoms we find with a herniated disc or a bulge discs are
},
{
    143.4,147.44
     localized pain. So we could just find pain that is just centered over the low back.
},
{
    147.44,149.68
     That can be a symptom of a bulge disc.
},
{
    149.68,154.16
     If that disc is starting to pinge or irritate a nerve root, we can have symptoms that travel
},
{
    154.16,156.0
     away from the spine.
},
{
    156.0,158.4
     The discs or the nerves that innervate our lower back.
},
{
    158.4,161.76
     So if we're to look at the spine again and we're to look at these yellow nerves, these
},
{
    161.76,164.96
     nerves exit the spine and travel down our leg.
},
{
    164.96,166.44
     They control the muscle activity,
},
{
    166.44,169.4
     they control the sensations of our lower limbs.
},
{
    169.4,170.84
     If they start to get irritated,
},
{
    170.84,172.82
     you're gonna start to feel symptoms down here.
},
{
    172.82,175.56
     It can start out with a general numbness and tingling,
},
{
    175.56,178.44
     it can progress to burning pain, radiating pain,
},
{
    178.44,179.88
     sharp pain, electric leg pain,
},
{
    179.88,182.92
     there's a variety of nerve-like symptoms that can develop.
},
{
    182.92,185.84
     If you get enough irritation to a nerve root,
},
{
    185.84,190.5
     you can actually start to develop weakness in those lower extremities. If we see muscle
},
{
    190.5,194.26
     weakness, we become more concerned about this condition, and it's something that needs to
},
{
    194.26,197.74
     be addressed immediately. So, as symptoms are hurting, a disc can be anything from just
},
{
    197.74,202.16
     general localized pain in your back. It can be a radiating type of pain, which can be
},
{
    202.16,207.92
     either numbness, tingling, burning, electric-like symptoms that travel away from the spine.
},
{
    207.92,210.52
     These can go down your leg, they can go to your knee,
},
{
    210.52,211.8
     they can go to the backside of your leg,
},
{
    211.8,214.04
     the front side, they can go all the way to your toes.
},
{
    214.04,215.88
     These are what we call radiating symptoms
},
{
    215.88,217.78
     because of impingement of a nerve root.
},
{
    217.78,220.76
     So when we talk about sitting equaling flexion,
},
{
    220.76,222.76
     I wanna go into this a little more detail,
},
{
    222.76,228.08
     because some people don't really understand why that is. Basically when you sit down this lower back
},
{
    228.08,231.16
     portion here you have a little bit of a curve or you should anyway but most
},
{
    231.16,234.88
     people don't. Hardly anybody sits down at their computer or at their table and
},
{
    234.88,238.28
     sits there like this. Most people the most common thing is actually to flatten
},
{
    238.28,241.64
     their low back out a little and push it against the back of the chair. That's
},
{
    241.64,248.08
     essentially taking those lower vertebrae and flexing them forward. Most people will sit there at their computers and type away and
},
{
    248.08,251.16
     again we have that head moving forward and we're just in this rounded position.
},
{
    251.16,255.28
     So a way to visualize that is if I'm sitting here with good curved posture
},
{
    255.28,259.64
     this is good. We're not flexing forward as much but as soon as I round out my
},
{
    259.64,263.16
     lower back and sit down that's what happens. So we're flexing those lower
},
{
    263.16,266.68
     vertebrae putting more pressure through these lower discs,
},
{
    266.68,268.88
     which eventually is gonna cause weakness.
},
{
    268.88,272.52
     Most people are sitting eight to 12 hours a day, every day.
},
{
    272.52,274.24
     You do that enough, you're gonna weaken those discs
},
{
    274.24,275.68
     and eventually you'll have a problem.
},
{
    275.68,277.6
     So for treatments of a herniated discs,
},
{
    277.6,279.96
     there's a variety of things you can try to do yourself
},
{
    279.96,282.64
     at home to alleviate some of that irritation
},
{
    282.64,285.6
     and that inflammation that's occurring at that disc level.
},
{
    286.24,290.96
     So the easiest one to do is avoid the activities that are irritating it. So that means avoiding
},
{
    290.96,294.72
     as much sitting as possible. This is hard for some people because of work, but you need to take
},
{
    294.72,299.36
     breaks at least. Get up every 20 to 30 minutes, at least for a minute or two, and walk around.
},
{
    300.0,304.24
     The other thing you could do is ice. Ice is a great way to decrease inflammation.
},
{
    304.24,306.4
     You do not want to put heat on the low back when it's
},
{
    306.4,307.52
     in an inflamed state like this.
},
{
    307.52,309.24
     You can actually make the symptoms worse.
},
{
    309.24,311.8
     I can't tell you how many times I've had people come to my office
},
{
    311.8,314.88
     and they tell me, I fell asleep on a heating pack last night
},
{
    314.88,316.04
     and I couldn't move this morning.
},
{
    316.04,317.0
     Well, there's a reason for that.
},
{
    317.0,319.44
     The heat increased the inflammation in the low back,
},
{
    319.44,321.2
     which caused more pressure on the nerve,
},
{
    321.2,322.76
     more pressure at the disc level,
},
{
    322.76,324.24
     which caused more symptoms.
},
{
    324.24,328.84
     So, icing for 20 minutes on and at least 40 minutes off,
},
{
    328.84,330.0
     repeating that throughout the day,
},
{
    330.0,331.96
     the first several days of the injury,
},
{
    331.96,334.56
     can go a long way in reducing that inflammation.
},
{
    334.56,336.92
     So you want to ice, you want to reduce the activities
},
{
    336.92,338.52
     that are stressing those discs.
},
{
    338.52,340.24
     When you're resting, instead of sitting,
},
{
    340.24,342.96
     what you should do is lay down with your feet up
},
{
    342.96,345.76
     on an object, either a chair or you can put
},
{
    345.76,350.08
     pillows on your knees to take some pressure off. Anytime your knees are flexed up, you're going to
},
{
    350.08,353.76
     take pressure off your low back. So when you're sleeping at night, if you sleep on your back,
},
{
    353.76,357.44
     try putting pillows under your knees. Take some pressure off. If you're sleeping on your side,
},
{
    357.44,360.88
     try actually putting a pillow between your knees and that'll take pressure off your low back as
},
{
    360.88,366.28
     well. The most common time for people that have pain and irritation is actually in the morning time
},
{
    366.28,367.88
     because that disc swells overnight.
},
{
    367.88,369.4
     It's very common to see that.
},
{
    369.4,371.44
     You want to be very careful in the morning time,
},
{
    371.44,373.44
     getting out of bed so you don't irritate it.
},
{
    373.44,375.12
     So no flexion at all.
},
{
    375.12,377.72
     The first couple hours that you get up,
},
{
    377.72,379.04
     you want to walk around and try
},
{
    379.04,380.64
     and just get things moving gently.
},
{
    380.64,382.12
     You want to avoid anything that causes pain,
},
{
    382.12,383.44
     is the general rule.
},
{
    383.44,388.76
     There are a variety of exercises you can do to help with the pain. So one of the best ones and one of the ones
},
{
    388.76,392.28
     I always give patients initially when they come in this is the cat cow. It's a simple
},
{
    392.28,398.68
     basic exercise that we can utilize to eliminate some of the irritation or eliminate some of
},
{
    398.68,403.06
     the bulging that's going on. It's very good for most people. I did an extensive video
},
{
    403.06,406.16
     on the cat cow exercise and how to do it properly and the things to avoid
},
{
    406.16,408.12
     so you could check it out at backauthority.com.
},
{
    408.12,409.68
     There are also many other exercises you could do
},
{
    409.68,411.6
     to try to eliminate some of that irritation
},
{
    411.6,414.74
     and that stress on the nerve or the disc level.
},
{
    414.74,416.64
     So it's important to try to look into these
},
{
    416.64,419.16
     and only do exercises that feel good.
},
{
    419.16,420.36
     If you're doing an exercise
},
{
    420.36,421.64
     and it's increasing your symptoms
},
{
    421.64,424.12
     or causing more discomfort, it's not a good exercise.
},
{
    424.12,428.04
     When it comes to low backs, the rule is not no pain, no gain.
},
{
    428.04,431.04
     If you're feeling pain, you should avoid that activity.
},
{
    431.04,432.64
     And if none of these modifications,
},
{
    432.64,436.64
     whether it's the ice or the activity limitations,
},
{
    436.64,439.12
     avoiding flexion or doing your cat cow,
},
{
    439.12,441.2
     if that's not helping to alleviate your symptoms,
},
{
    441.2,443.24
     it's important you seek professional help.
