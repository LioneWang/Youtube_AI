     By the end of this video, you're going to know whether you have a sprain or a misalignment
},
{
    4.84,14.64
     of the sternocleavicular joint.
},
{
    14.64,17.44
     This is a rare sprain, but it does happen.
},
{
    17.44,23.08
     And very often with chronic shoulder problems, I find that the sternocleavicular joint is
},
{
    23.08,26.0
     the thing that no one looks for, but sometimes
},
{
    26.0,29.44
     it's the secret to getting people's shoulders to feel better.
},
{
    29.44,34.56
     What you do is you have to take your shirt off, look at these bumps right here below
},
{
    34.56,35.68
     your throat.
},
{
    35.68,40.8
     So if you take your finger and you push in the soft spot of your throat, the bones are
},
{
    40.8,42.4
     right to the side.
},
{
    42.4,48.4
     And what you'll do is you'll take your fingertips and place them on the actual bones themselves
},
{
    48.4,50.08
     and make sure that they're level.
},
{
    50.08,52.08
     That's clue number one, you've sprained
},
{
    52.08,54.64
     your sternoclavicular joint.
},
{
    54.64,58.56
     Number two, very often the joint will be tender to the touch.
},
{
    58.56,60.64
     So when you touch it, it'll actually feel
},
{
    60.64,62.88
     like a little bit of a bogginess or swelling.
},
{
    62.88,70.08
     Last test that I do, and this is very difficult to do at home, motion palpation. And what we do is there's two methods of doing
},
{
    70.08,74.72
     it. We can grab the sternoclavicular joint and push it down and up and see if it has
},
{
    74.72,80.08
     good motion. The bone should actually move like this. The second way, and I like to do
},
{
    80.08,85.04
     it this way, is to place my finger on the joint, have the patient raise their arm, and
},
{
    85.04,90.4
     the sternoclavicular joint, the clavicle, will actually go down and rotate.
},
{
    90.4,94.32
     It'll go down and rotate, and you can actually feel that motion.
},
{
    94.32,100.16
     So when there's lack of motion there, very often other areas will try to compensate and
},
{
    100.16,101.64
     make up the slack.
},
{
    101.64,107.18
     So very often when a person has a shoulder problem, they have a C joint problems,
},
{
    107.18,111.12
     and it's not resolving with normal type of therapies,
},
{
    111.12,113.76
     what we'll find is the person has an old injury
},
{
    113.76,115.76
     to their sternoclavicular joint,
},
{
    115.76,118.76
     and how we know that is when they raise their arm,
},
{
    118.76,121.76
     the bone doesn't go down and it doesn't rotate.
},
{
    121.76,124.12
     So the adjustment, the chiropractic adjustment,
},
{
    124.12,125.76
     is to recreate that motion, so we'll adjust it down't rotate. So the adjustment, the chiropractic adjustment is to recreate that motion.
},
{
    125.76,131.52
     So we'll adjust it down and rotate it and very often the person will get a full range of motion
},
{
    131.52,136.24
     of their shoulder. But that's how you know if you've had a sternal clavicular joint. It's very
},
{
    136.24,141.84
     common. I see it a lot in my practice because I see a lot of cyclists and cyclists, they fall in
},
{
    141.84,145.08
     one of two ways. They either fall with their arm outstretched
},
{
    145.08,146.12
     if they can do that,
},
{
    146.12,149.64
     or very often they'll fall and hit their shoulder like this.
},
{
    149.64,152.08
     If they don't break their collarbone, they're lucky,
},
{
    152.08,153.72
     but sometimes they'll actually sprain
},
{
    153.72,155.44
     the sternoclavicular joint.
},
{
    155.44,158.76
     It also happens with, there's a local high school here,
},
{
    158.76,160.88
     and I treat a lot of high school athletes.
},
{
    160.88,163.24
     Kids will fall on their shoulder,
},
{
    163.24,164.72
     they'll be due wrestling.
},
{
    164.72,165.64
     Swimmers get it
},
{
    165.64,167.88
     as well from repetitive motion.
