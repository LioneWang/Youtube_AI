     Hello, when we measure someone's temperature we are measuring how warm or cold they are.
},
{
    7.2,16.18
     To do this we use a thermometer and the reading is given in degrees centigrade.
},
{
    16.18,21.48
     The human body is very clever and works hard to keep our vital organs such as our brain,
},
{
    21.48,26.26
     heart and kidneys at a steady temperature of 37 degrees centigrade.
},
{
    26.26,29.18
     In order to keep our temperature at the same level,
},
{
    29.18,32.36
     our blood vessels and skin works to either warm us up
},
{
    32.36,34.36
     or cool us down.
},
{
    34.36,37.56
     When we get too cold, hairs on our skin stand up
},
{
    37.56,40.08
     to trap heat and warm us up.
},
{
    40.08,42.84
     Our blood vessels narrow so that less blood flows
},
{
    42.84,45.28
     to our skin and less heat is lost to
},
{
    45.28,47.48
     the outside world.
},
{
    47.48,51.02
     When we get too hot our skin starts to sweat.
},
{
    51.02,56.44
     As the sweat dries heat gets transferred away from our body to cool us down.
},
{
    56.44,61.52
     Our blood vessels widen so more blood flows to our skin and more heat is lost to the outside
},
{
    61.52,66.84
     world.
},
{
    66.84,72.64
     A high temperature above 38 degrees centigrade is described as a fever and is often a sign
},
{
    72.64,78.4
     of infection.
},
{
    78.4,85.6
     A low body temperature below 36 degrees centigrade might mean that the person has been in a cold environment and
},
{
    85.6,91.08
     will go back to normal when they warm up. But it can also be a sign that a person is
},
{
    91.08,95.56
     ill so don't ignore a low temperature if you are worried.
},
{
    95.56,105.72
     There are lots of types of thermometers including digital, ear and strip type thermometers. Strip type
},
{
    105.72,109.08
     thermometers are not as good as they measure the temperature of the skin and
},
{
    109.08,114.4
     not the core body temperature. If possible the best thermometer to use is the
},
{
    114.4,119.0
     ear thermometer as they are quick and easy to use and usually come with
},
{
    119.0,123.8
     instructions. These can be bought from pharmacies to keep in the home with the
},
{
    123.8,126.2
     person you care for.
},
{
    126.2,130.8
     If you are using an ear thermometer, check the person is happy to have their temperature
},
{
    130.8,132.8
     checked.
},
{
    132.8,135.88
     Make sure that the thermometer is clean.
},
{
    135.88,140.6
     Put a new, clean disposable cover on the end of the probe.
},
{
    140.6,144.72
     Gently pull the ear back and put the probe into the ear canal.
},
{
    144.72,148.0
     The ear canal points slightly downwards and to the face.
},
{
    148.0,153.0
     The reading may not be accurate if the probe isn't fully put into the ear.
},
{
    153.0,157.0
     Squeeze and hold down the button for one second.
},
{
    157.0,161.0
     Remove the thermometer and read the temperature.
},
{
    161.0,165.28
     Write down the temperature as it can be easy to forget the numbers.
},
{
    165.28,171.94
     Throw the disposable tip away. If you're worried about someone's temperature please
