     Hey everybody, it's Doctor Jo.

     Today I'm going to show you some stretches for neck spasms, which are never fun.
},
{
    19.52,20.88
     So let's get started.
},
{
    20.88,30.86
     For the first exercise, just take your hands and kind of clasp them behind your head and your neck area. Bend your head forward tucking that chin in and by
},
{
    30.86,36.14
     using your elbows to help give you some motion just rotate your head back and
},
{
    36.14,41.76
     forth. So you're kind of pulling through with that bottom elbow just to give you
},
{
    41.76,50.4
     a little stretch in there. You can just move back and forth like I am about 10 times or you can kind of pause there and hold it for
},
{
    50.4,55.0
     about three to five seconds stretching one way and then doing that maybe five
},
{
    55.0,60.22
     times with the three to five second hold. The next one you can still take your
},
{
    60.22,64.04
     hands and kind of now clasp them a little bit higher up on your head so not
},
{
    64.04,66.6
     necessarily in the curb, but higher up.
},
{
    66.6,71.28
     And then this time, just use your elbow on the top to kind of push over.
},
{
    71.28,74.2
     So now it's more of a side bending kind of motion.
},
{
    74.2,77.64
     So reaching one way and then coming back.
},
{
    77.64,85.92
     So same thing, you can either just kind of do a continuous motion side to side or you can hold it there for about three to five
},
{
    85.92,92.96
     seconds and do about five of those. The last stretch you're going to need a
},
{
    92.96,98.28
     towel, something long enough to actually wrap around you a little bit. Now don't
},
{
    98.28,103.4
     try strangling yourself this is kind of an awkward motion but with the towel on
},
{
    103.4,105.24
     your left side you want to
},
{
    105.24,109.24
     actually take your right hand and grab it and then the towel part on your right
},
{
    109.24,113.68
     side grab with your left hand. You're going to bring it about where your ear
},
{
    113.68,119.16
     is and then across your face just really comfortably right there. That's why you
},
{
    119.16,124.08
     want to use a towel so it doesn't hurt and go up at an angle almost like towards
},
{
    124.08,128.92
     the crease of the ceiling and then pull to the side while you're taking your other hand and
},
{
    128.92,133.68
     pulling downward. So this is just going to give you an extra tight rotation
},
{
    133.68,139.64
     stretch there. Hold this one for about 15 to 20 seconds if you can and then
},
{
    139.64,150.08
     come back down, switch sides, holding here, pulling up here, and going towards the other side.
},
{
    151.08,157.34
     There you have it. Whoo! Those were the stretches for neck spasms. If you have
