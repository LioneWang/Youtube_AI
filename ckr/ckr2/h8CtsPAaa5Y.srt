     Hey everyone, it's Sarah with RegisterNurseRN.com and in this video I'm going to demonstrate
},
{
    4.88,8.08
     how to change an osmium pouching system.
},
{
    8.08,13.92
     In the previous video I did an NCLEX review over colosmium and ileosmium so be sure to
},
{
    13.92,15.72
     check out that video.
},
{
    15.72,18.68
     So first let's talk about the supplies you will need.
},
{
    18.68,21.32
     You will need a pouching system.
},
{
    21.32,26.72
     Here I have a one-piece pouching system and it has a skin barrier also called a wafer
},
{
    26.72,33.92
     flange and it's attached to the pouch so it comes together. Some people have the two-piece systems
},
{
    33.92,39.84
     and the skin barrier and the pouch are separate and they snap onto each other whenever you're
},
{
    39.84,51.12
     placing the system. Also what you may need that I don't have right here, you may need a barrier ring and the barrier ring will go around the stoma for extra protection in case
},
{
    51.12,56.04
     the patient is having a lot of skin breakdown from still getting onto the skin and the skin
},
{
    56.04,61.44
     barrier just isn't really protecting it. So the barrier ring would go around the stoma
},
{
    61.44,65.04
     and then you would set the skin barrier on top of that.
},
{
    66.0,72.0
     And then also with this particular system we have a clip. So be sure you get the clip if your
},
{
    72.0,79.04
     patient needs one. Some bags will velcro and that's how they close but this particular one
},
{
    79.04,85.94
     uses a clip. Another thing you will need is a measuring card and these come in the kits
},
{
    85.94,91.04
     usually and you will just be using it to measure the stoma because you will be
},
{
    91.04,97.48
     cutting around your barrier what size the stoma is so you can apply it to the
},
{
    97.48,103.68
     skin. So you'll need a pen, you will also need some ostomy scissors. These scissors
},
{
    103.68,105.32
     are special in that they're curved
},
{
    105.32,106.84
     and they have a blunt tip.
},
{
    106.84,110.14
     So you can achieve a circular cut
},
{
    110.14,113.32
     instead of a jagged cut onto the barrier.
},
{
    113.32,115.88
     And of course you will need gloves.
},
{
    115.88,118.76
     You will need some wash cloths to clean the stoma
},
{
    118.76,120.76
     and to dry it in a towel
},
{
    120.76,124.44
     just to prevent any leakage of stool onto the patient.
},
{
    124.44,128.96
     First, perform hand hygiene
},
{
    128.96,146.84
     and then you will don gloves. Then get a towel and place that on your patient to protect their gown and their skin from
},
{
    146.84,150.08
     any stool while you're changing the system.
},
{
    150.08,153.64
     And some things you want to keep in mind while doing this, you'll want to change the system
},
{
    153.64,159.64
     about every three to five days and you will empty the pouch whenever it becomes one-third
},
{
    159.64,161.16
     to halfway full.
},
{
    161.16,164.84
     And here as you can see this definitely needs to be emptied but we're changing the system
},
{
    164.84,166.72
     so it's good. And
},
{
    166.72,168.84
     while you're doing this you want to
},
{
    168.84,170.72
     allow the patient to help you as much as
},
{
    170.72,172.32
     possible because they need to become
},
{
    172.32,173.92
     independent in doing this because I'll
},
{
    173.92,177.36
     be doing it whenever they go home. Now if
},
{
    177.36,179.88
     you are a nurse who has a very sensitive
},
{
    179.88,182.16
     nose and you're bothered by odorous
},
{
    182.16,186.56
     smells and you need to be prepared for this because whenever
},
{
    186.56,191.92
     you're changing an ostomy bag there are some pungent odors. And to help with this you can maybe
},
{
    191.92,198.32
     wear a mask. I've even known some colleagues to put vapor rub around their nose before they go
},
{
    198.32,205.56
     in to change the pouch to prevent the smell and so you can have a menthol smell in your nose as you're changing it.
},
{
    205.56,209.4
     So just be aware of that and prepare beforehand.
},
{
    209.4,215.36
     So what we're going to do is we're going to remove the system and whenever you do this,
},
{
    215.36,218.48
     you want to do this when the gut is the least active because you don't want to be changing
},
{
    218.48,222.4
     this and all this stool is just coming out on you because you're going to be making a
},
{
    222.4,223.92
     huge mess.
},
{
    223.92,228.34
     So usually in the morning before breakfast, before the patient eats is the best time
},
{
    228.34,232.26
     or ask the patient because they'll know when their stoma puts out the least.
},
{
    232.26,234.74
     But if this is a brand new stoma, they may not know.
},
{
    234.74,238.96
     So what you're going to do is you're just gently going to remove the adhesive because
},
{
    238.96,243.18
     this is the one piece system and it's sticking to the skin.
},
{
    243.18,246.32
     And if you have difficulty removing it, you can use some
},
{
    246.32,254.2
     adhesive remover. Okay, so we have that off. What you're going to do is just discard this
},
{
    254.2,266.82
     appropriately. Then you're going to take your washcloth with warm water. Try not to use any soaps that have lotions,
},
{
    266.82,272.9
     powders, creams, or any alcohol containing products around the stoma or on the
},
{
    272.9,278.14
     stoma because it causes some problems. And before you do it, you want to make sure
},
{
    278.14,281.78
     you're looking around the stoma and looking for any skin breakdown like
},
{
    281.78,286.0
     extreme redness. Now as you can see in this example,
},
{
    286.0,288.16
     there is redness around the stoma.
},
{
    288.16,289.16
     This is not good.
},
{
    289.16,291.88
     And what is happening is that stool is leaking
},
{
    291.88,295.2
     probably under that skin barrier and getting onto the skin.
},
{
    295.2,298.8
     So whenever you're replacing the pouching system,
},
{
    298.8,300.8
     you may wanna use a barrier ring
},
{
    300.8,304.04
     and make sure that you're cutting the skin barrier
},
{
    304.04,305.92
     to fit the stoma appropriately
},
{
    305.92,308.88
     so it's not leaking onto the skin.
},
{
    308.88,317.4
     And what you'll do is you'll start around the skin and just gently clean the skin,
},
{
    317.4,330.28
     making sure to get any residue off, and then you will clean your stoma and the stoma is not painful to the
},
{
    330.28,335.8
     patient. Remember it's just the inside of the intestines flipped inside out so
},
{
    335.8,346.52
     it's not painful for you to clean the stoma and make sure you have it all clean.
},
{
    346.52,349.24
     Then you will pat the area dry.
},
{
    349.24,355.16
     You want this to be very dry because if it's not dry, your skin barrier is not going to
},
{
    355.16,358.0
     stick to the skin.
},
{
    358.0,361.52
     If you have a patient who has a lot of hair on the abdomen because you know hair grows
},
{
    361.52,366.2
     back, you may want to trim the hair because number
},
{
    366.2,371.04
     one it will stick better and when you remove next pouch change it is not going to wax their
},
{
    371.04,379.44
     hair off which can be very painful. So make sure you do that. Then discard your gloves
},
{
    379.44,388.16
     and perform hand hygiene and put on a new pair of gloves. Now we're going to measure our stoma using our measuring card.
},
{
    388.16,392.84
     And the reason we want to do this is because we're going to be cutting a hole on our skin
},
{
    392.84,393.84
     barrier.
},
{
    393.84,398.0
     And this is going to be going on the skin and we don't want to cut it too big.
},
{
    398.0,401.88
     We're still going to leak onto the skin or cut it too small where it will constrict the
},
{
    401.88,402.88
     stoma.
},
{
    402.88,405.68
     So we want to measure appropriately. And you'll
},
{
    405.68,410.8
     take your measuring card and you'll put it flush up against the skin and you want about a 1-8 inch
},
{
    411.76,415.28
     area around the stoma. So this right here, way too big.
},
{
    417.84,426.72
     That is too big as well. Let's try this one. And that one looks like it's perfect.
},
{
    426.72,429.92
     You have around the soma about a 1 eighth inch.
},
{
    429.92,434.48
     And look and see what it reads and it says 45 millimeters.
},
{
    434.48,439.48
     So we're going to match that up on our bag and trace it.
},
{
    439.48,442.36
     Now some skin barriers are already labeled
},
{
    442.36,444.16
     and they have a nice little outline
},
{
    444.16,445.56
     of where your measurement is.
},
{
    445.56,449.8
     Like here it already says 45mm so I don't have to trace it.
},
{
    449.8,451.84
     But sometimes skim barriers don't have that.
},
{
    451.84,459.92
     So what you would have to do is put your measuring card over it and trace where you had your
},
{
    459.92,461.04
     measurement.
},
{
    461.04,465.68
     So you would find the 45mm and you would just create a circle on the
},
{
    465.68,470.04
     barrier and then cut it out. Now I'm going to take my ostomy scissors and I'm going
},
{
    470.04,514.72
     to cut around the 45 millimeter mark. And And just go back through and make sure everything's nice and round and there's no jagged edges
},
{
    514.72,519.56
     because you don't want this to wear on the stoma or on the patient's skin.
},
{
    519.56,522.58
     And we have it and it looks good.
},
{
    522.58,524.84
     Now let's put the new pouching system on.
},
{
    524.84,529.84
     What I like to do is I like to snap my bag and make sure it's closed before I put it
},
{
    529.84,532.64
     on just in case something leaks out.
},
{
    532.64,537.38
     So this is the clip, like I said at the beginning, some Velcro.
},
{
    537.38,541.92
     These clips can be a little bit cumbersome to you, so get familiar with how to use them.
},
{
    541.92,546.9
     What you do is you take the end of it, the bag, and you just simply fold it over the
},
{
    546.9,555.18
     clip like so, and then you just press that down and it snaps in place.
},
{
    555.18,557.78
     And you have your little clip on.
},
{
    557.78,563.5
     And then you will take the backing off of your skim barrier.
},
{
    563.5,565.88
     And if you're going to place a barrier ring now would be
},
{
    565.88,570.84
     the time to do that so you place the barrier ring on it around the stoma and then you would
},
{
    570.84,581.32
     place your skin barrier your wafer flange on over the stoma.
},
{
    581.32,587.52
     And you want to make sure that it fits really good and that you smooth it around the stomach so it's sticking to the skin
},
{
    589.04,591.04
     appropriately
},
{
    591.04,592.56
     and
},
{
    592.56,597.16
     Feels very good now some things you want to keep in mind if this is a new
},
{
    598.28,602.88
     Ostomy for the patient you want to explain to them that they need to be checking their bag
},
{
    603.38,606.92
     You want to explain to them that they need to be checking their bag ever so often because it can inflate with gas
},
{
    606.92,610.44
     and they will need to do what's called burping their bag.
},
{
    610.44,614.3
     And to burp this particular bag you would take
},
{
    614.3,617.78
     off this clip and just let the air out. Now some
},
{
    617.78,622.58
     awesome bags do have a filter that allows the gas to escape
},
{
    622.58,626.34
     and prevents an odorous smell from coming out.
},
{
    626.34,628.66
     So you just have to look to see what you have
},
{
    628.66,633.5
     and just warn the patient that when they do
},
{
    633.5,635.46
     relieve the gas from their bag
},
{
    635.46,638.38
     that they may wanna make sure that no one's around
},
{
    638.38,640.26
     if someone's visiting them or something like that
},
{
    640.26,642.58
     cause it can produce an odorous smell.
},
{
    642.58,647.48
     And as the nurse, you want to be checking this as well because our patients tend to wear those big bulky
},
{
    647.48,652.92
     gowns and they can occlude you being able to see if the bag's inflate so you'll
},
{
    652.92,657.28
     have to pull the gown back and actually look at the bag. So that is how you change
},
{
    657.28,661.8
     an awesomy pouching system. Thank you so much for watching and don't forget to
