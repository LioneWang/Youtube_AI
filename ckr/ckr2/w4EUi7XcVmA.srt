     In this quick video, I want to go over a common question I get from patients, which is, are

    10.62,14.64
     there any tips that can help me while trying to sleep with sciatica?
},
{
    14.64,18.44
     So in this video, I want to give some really easy positions to get into that might help

     alleviate your pain at night.
},
{
    20.12,24.08
     Also, we're going to tackle the issue of getting up out of bed in the morning so we're not
},
{
    24.08,27.0
     causing a flare up with your sciatic nerve pain.
},
{
    27.0,34.0
     So let's get started.
},
{
    34.0,39.12
     The best position for sleeping is flat on your back while keeping your body aligned straight.
},
{
    39.12,43.68
     Put a small pillow underneath your knees to keep them bent as this will take stress off
},
{
    43.68,45.16
     the low back. For extra support, you can put a small this will take stress off the low back.
},
{
    45.16,49.64
     For extra support, you can put a small pillow underneath the curve of the low back.
},
{
    49.64,53.64
     This helps lower stress on your joints and ligaments while helping to maintain the natural
},
{
    53.64,55.28
     curve of your spine.
},
{
    55.28,60.16
     This is the ideal position for sleeping with sciatica pain.
},
{
    60.16,62.64
     Sleeping on your side would come as the second best choice.
},
{
    62.64,66.08
     You'll want your legs pulled up slightly towards your chest and a pillow between your
},
{
    66.08,67.08
     knees.
},
{
    67.08,70.26
     For extra support, you can place a pillow underneath your side.
},
{
    70.26,74.82
     This will allow the body to stay in a more natural posture and help prevent extra pressure
},
{
    74.82,77.04
     on your back, neck, and shoulders.
},
{
    77.04,79.46
     Never try to sleep on your stomach.
},
{
    79.46,82.26
     Sleeping on your stomach flattens the natural curve of the spine.
},
{
    82.26,88.66
     Also, sleeping all night with the head twisted to one side will strain the neck. If you absolutely cannot break this
},
{
    88.66,92.9
     habit, put a pillow underneath the stomach to help support the spine. In the
},
{
    92.9,96.62
     morning, our bodies are generally stiff from lying in a position for a long time.
},
{
    96.62,100.9
     So people tend to have more soreness and pain in the low back when they try to get
},
{
    100.9,105.16
     out of bed. A simple tip, avoid flexion or forward bending at
},
{
    105.16,109.42
     the waist in the morning. You can see in this demonstration I'm bending from the
},
{
    109.42,113.32
     waist and putting a lot of pressure on the joints of the low back. A better way
},
{
    113.32,117.58
     to do this is to roll over on one side then bring the legs off the side of the
},
{
    117.58,None
     bed while using your arms to slowly lift yourself up off the bed.
