     Hi, in this video we're going to go through how to find the trigger point knots in the
},
{
    7.64,10.24
     neck area, especially the front of the neck.
},
{
    10.24,13.68
     Hi, Dr. Jasper here from WizardOfHealth.net.
},
{
    13.68,17.24
     A lot of people get a lot of trigger points coming from the neck which can give them headaches
},
{
    17.24,18.76
     or neck pain.
},
{
    18.76,22.76
     Now when we look at the neck you've got to be really, really careful with self treatments.
},
{
    22.76,25.92
     A lot of times when my patients start doing self-treatments here,
},
{
    25.92,29.28
     what I want to do is I want to show you guys what areas to avoid
},
{
    29.28,32.96
     and what areas to stick to, and this way it'll be a lot easier.
},
{
    32.96,36.0
     Now with these muscles right now, we're going to go through very general, but
},
{
    36.0,39.52
     basically show you how to do it. If you want to get into the specifics of
},
{
    39.52,42.88
     each muscle, we have other posts on WizardOfHealth.net
},
{
    42.88,46.0
     on the scaling muscle and the sternocleidomastoid muscle
},
{
    46.0,49.0
     and the digastric muscle, which is all in the neck area.
},
{
    49.0,53.0
     But right now, let's just go with a general overview on how to actually do it.
},
{
    53.0,59.0
     Now the front of the neck is one of those muscles or one of those areas that you can actually just use your fingers.
},
{
    59.0,61.0
     You don't have to use any other type of tool.
},
{
    61.0,63.0
     So let's start off with that first.
},
{
    63.0,68.84
     The best way to get a landmark is what you're going to do is you're going to find the sternocleidomastoid
},
{
    68.84,73.96
     muscle. Now the sterno is sternum so it attaches to the sternum and the mastoid
},
{
    73.96,79.12
     part is it attaches to the mastoid bone back here. And the way we find that is
},
{
    79.12,82.6
     we're going to turn our neck and you're going to notice that this muscle starts
},
{
    82.6,88.28
     popping up. Now if I bend my neck, if I put a little bit of pressure on my head it'll pop out a
},
{
    88.28,93.2
     little bit more. Now anything on the inside of this muscle you want to avoid.
},
{
    93.2,98.12
     So we want to go here and out. That's pretty much the whole area that I want
},
{
    98.12,102.36
     you to stick to. Now the way to hit this muscle is you can actually pinch it
},
{
    102.36,105.68
     right between your fingers. Now the other thing is
},
{
    105.68,110.64
     when you're pinching it you can go pinching it all the way up until you find some spots that are
},
{
    110.64,116.48
     really really tender and if it's recurring or giving you the pain that you're feeling that's
},
{
    116.48,121.28
     the spot you want to hold on for about 30 seconds up to about a minute. Wait for the pain to start
},
{
    121.28,130.0
     decreasing a bit and then move on to the next spot. One of the key factors is when you're going up and down is you need to go all the way down into the collar bone.
},
{
    130.0,135.5
     A lot of people always stay in the middle. You need to go all the way down, go above the collar bone,
},
{
    135.5,142.0
     and again just press in with those hands, or you need to go all the way up right back to the back of that mastoid muscle.
},
{
    142.0,144.0
     And you need to go up and down.
},
{
    144.0,145.16
     Now the other thing is, as soon as let's find that muscle again, there mastoid muscle. And you need to go up and down. Now the other thing is,
},
{
    145.16,149.76
     as soon as let's find that muscle again, there's that muscle. So we can pinch this muscle.
},
{
    149.76,152.92
     But now if we're going to go a little bit to the outside of it, we're going to use two
},
{
    152.92,157.6
     fingers. So again, here's the muscle, we're going to go a little bit to the outside, again
},
{
    157.6,162.6
     all the way down to here, find those spots, those trigger points, and then move our way
},
{
    162.6,165.48
     up and all the way up,
},
{
    165.48,167.48
     and then just keep moving our way up.
},
{
    167.48,168.84
     And another interesting thing is,
},
{
    168.84,170.94
     if you feel a pulse under your fingers,
},
{
    170.94,172.36
     you're on the carotid artery,
},
{
    172.36,173.96
     you wanna move away from that.
},
{
    173.96,175.12
     Again, from this muscle,
},
{
    175.12,176.64
     you wanna start all the way to the bottom
},
{
    176.64,178.32
     and then go all the way up.
},
{
    178.32,179.48
     So as you guys can see,
},
{
    179.48,181.48
     we have two different ways of doing this.
},
{
    181.48,183.64
     We can pinch that muscle,
},
{
    183.64,186.08
     or we can use the two fingers and press and
},
{
    186.08,191.92
     palpate down. Or what I do is I sometimes even use three fingers so I can hit more of that muscle.
},
{
    191.92,196.88
     I don't have to go one spot at a time. I can pretty much hit three different spots at a time.
},
{
    196.88,202.08
     Again, as you're seeing, I'm using this hand and reaching around it. A lot of my patients,
},
{
    202.08,208.72
     they find out that this hand gets a little bit tired. They love to use their thumb. If you've got some cream, you can put some cream in there. You can
},
{
    208.72,213.92
     actually kind of strip it down, find a spot, hold it, strip it down again, and find another spot.
},
{
    213.92,218.96
     And the best way to do it with the thumb is instead of keeping the elbow down, and I'm just kind of
},
{
    218.96,224.0
     sliding down like that, what I'm going to do is first of all find that sternocleidomastoid,
},
{
    224.0,228.18
     go a little bit behind it, and then I'm going to bring that arm up. So I'm going to do is first of all find that sternocleidomastoid, go a little bit behind it, and then I'm going to bring that arm up.
},
{
    228.18,233.58
     So I'm going to work my way all the way to the top, and I'm going to slide it down.
},
{
    233.58,238.1
     And by doing this, I'm using the pressure of that arm to apply pressure right onto that
},
{
    238.1,242.92
     muscle, and as soon as I find that spot, I'm going to hold it for a few seconds, let that
},
{
    242.92,247.64
     relieve, and then I'm going to go down a little bit more, hold it for a few seconds, and then once that
},
{
    247.64,252.28
     pain starts coming down I'm going to go down a bit more. So you can use your
},
{
    252.28,256.16
     fingers, two fingers, three fingers, you can do a pinching action, or you can use
},
{
    256.16,260.68
     your thumb from the same side as you angle downwards and then just slide all
},
{
    260.68,265.6
     the way down. Another thing you can use is what we usually use is a recommend,
},
{
    265.6,270.22
     is a device I developed called a muscle wizard. And that allows me to actually take the entire
},
{
    270.22,274.74
     pressure off my hands. I'll find the spot with the muscle wizard and then I can use
},
{
    274.74,280.0
     my leg as leverage to kind of bring that leg in and out to increase or decrease the pressure
},
{
    280.0,284.54
     on that muscle. That also makes it a lot easier. So at the end of the day guys, there's a wide
},
{
    284.54,289.2
     variety of different ways to treat the muscles in the front of the neck. Again, as soon as you find
},
{
    289.2,294.24
     that sternocleidomastoid muscle, anything on the inside of it, you want to avoid, you want to stick
},
{
    294.24,299.2
     to that, and then go a little bit to the outside. And if you want to get more specifics on each muscle,
},
{
    299.2,305.52
     we have specific videos on that on WizardOfHealth.net. Log on and check out some of our other videos.
},
{
    305.52,307.36
     And we'll definitely see you guys in another video.
},
{
    307.36,308.2
     Thanks.
