     In this video, I'm going to show you the greatest breathing exercise ever.
},
{
    4.48,7.76
     My name is Dr. Storey. I've been a chiropractor for over 24 years.
},
{
    7.76,11.04
     I do a lot of holistic things for patients.
},
{
    11.04,17.6
     And what I'm going to do today is I'm going to show you a great way to exercise your lungs and your ribs.
},
{
    17.6,20.32
     I'm going to show it to you right now. We're just going to jump into it.
},
{
    20.32,28.32
     And I'm going to show you what happens to my oxygen levels and my pulse when we do this.
},
{
    28.32,31.44
     So number one, here's the important thing is,
},
{
    31.44,33.72
     there are so many people that tell you,
},
{
    33.72,35.94
     you're breathing wrong, you're not doing it right,
},
{
    35.94,37.84
     you should breathe this way or that way.
},
{
    37.84,40.32
     The way that works the best is the way
},
{
    40.32,42.1
     that works the best for you.
},
{
    42.1,44.04
     But I'm gonna give you my suggestions.
},
{
    44.04,45.94
     Again, I've been doing this a long time.
},
{
    45.94,48.76
     I find this helps patients for a number of reasons.
},
{
    48.76,52.72
     The first is it helps them reduce their anxiety.
},
{
    52.72,54.38
     It helps them reduce their depression.
},
{
    54.38,56.64
     It helps them reduce stress.
},
{
    56.64,60.92
     It actually has an effect not just on those things,
},
{
    60.92,63.08
     but it has some other effects too,
},
{
    63.08,66.4
     based upon how it influences our nervous system.
},
{
    66.4,72.0
     And our nervous system actually plays a role in our blood pressure, and that's why it works,
},
{
    72.0,77.12
     particularly the systolic, which is the first number. Now, I am going to show you with this
},
{
    77.12,82.96
     instrument how this works, and you do this along with me. So I do this about once a day,
},
{
    83.68,85.16
     and what we're going to do is we're going to take
},
{
    85.16,92.32
     a preliminary right now. I'm going to hit this button. So my oxygen level is 98, 97,
},
{
    92.32,97.0
     and my pulse is about 56. I'm going to put that right up there so maybe you can, let's
},
{
    97.0,107.14
     see if you can focus on it here. Okay, so let's do the deep breathing. Now how this works is very simple.
},
{
    107.14,110.74
     What I'm going to do is I'm going to breathe in through the nose, out through the mouth,
},
{
    110.74,115.86
     and I'm going to start with my belly, and then as soon as my belly expands, I'm going
},
{
    115.86,117.58
     to expand my chest.
},
{
    117.58,122.9
     My chest, this is the important thing, my chest is going to go forward and backwards
},
{
    122.9,126.16
     and to the side. I'm going to expand my chest as much as I
},
{
    126.16,135.2
     humanly can. Kind of like Thor. And let's go ahead and get started and then we're going to retest
},
{
    135.2,136.96
     with this. So here we go.

So I hope that shows you that there are great benefits of deep breathing.

     There really is no right way to breathe, but there's also no wrong way to breathe because
},
{
    420.56,425.56
     in my professional opinion, if you're breathing, you're doing it right.
},
{
    425.56,427.8
     However, there might be some optimal ways
},
{
    427.8,430.12
     that can get you greater benefits
},
{
    430.12,433.96
     and better efficiency of your time spent.
},
{
    433.96,436.52
     So by doing this once a day, every day
},
{
    436.52,438.12
     for the rest of your life,
},
{
    438.12,440.04
     hopefully you will gain benefit.
},
{
    440.04,443.8
     And as I've shown you, there are many ways to do it,
},
{
    443.8,446.48
     but this way really works.
