     Hey everybody, it's Doctor Jo and sad unicorn Callie. She's sad because her tailbone hurts.
},
{
    6.64,12.24
     So I'm going to show you my top seven ways to relieve tailbone pain in humans. So let's get started.
},
{
    17.76,22.0
     So for the tailbone or the coccyx, you really want to get that area moving,
},
{
    22.0,26.6
     the pelvis in general, but kind of down to the bottom of the spine because that's where that coccyx is.
},
{
    26.6,30.8
     So the first one that you're going to do is kind of get over into all fours.
},
{
    30.8,36.4
     You want to spread your knees out about shoulder width apart, but you're going to bring your feet in something.
},
{
    36.4,40.4
     You don't have to make them touch, but you just want to bring them a little closer in than your knees.
},
{
    40.4,45.72
     You're going to kind of lean back almost like you're going to sit down on
},
{
    45.72,49.68
     your feet but not go all the way down and once you kind of get to a stretch
},
{
    49.68,55.0
     there you're just gonna kind of shift back and forth or we sometimes call it
},
{
    55.0,59.84
     wagging the tail. So this is just gonna help get that tailbone area loosened up
},
{
    59.84,71.28
     a little bit. So you can just go continuously back and forth like I'm doing or you can kind of sit over to one side and do maybe like a five to ten second
},
{
    71.28,75.96
     stretch and then come back up and then shift over. So you should really feel
},
{
    75.96,81.6
     that stretch down in that pelvis area and that coccyx area down in there. So then
},
{
    81.6,87.36
     after that you're gonna come back up onto all fours and do a cat dog.
},
{
    87.36,93.36
     Some people call it cat cow. Whatever you want to call it I like the cat dogs. So the cat you're
},
{
    93.36,98.4
     going to come up arching up your back and tucking in your chin. So you're going to come up like this
},
{
    98.4,103.68
     just like when a cat stretches really trying to stretch everything there and then you're going to
},
{
    103.68,110.5
     drop down into that dog or that cow and bring your head up and really try and drop your hips down almost
},
{
    110.5,114.76
     like you're making a saddle with your back. And so that should really again really help
},
{
    114.76,121.08
     get that area loosened up back there. You can do a five to 10 second hold. If you want
},
{
    121.08,128.56
     to go longer like a 30 second hold, you can do that as well. But just alternating back and forth. So when you arch your back, tucking in the
},
{
    128.56,134.12
     chin, holding that, and then when you drop it down, bring your head up and look
},
{
    134.12,138.36
     forward. Really get that stretch in there. So you can go back and forth maybe
},
{
    138.36,141.88
     five times. If you're doing a longer stretch, like 30 seconds, then you can
},
{
    141.88,148.92
     just do three times each way. So then you're gonna go into a full child's pose which is kind of what we started off in
},
{
    148.92,152.64
     the beginning but now you're gonna go all the way down. Some people like to
},
{
    152.64,157.56
     start off sitting first back this way and then kind of opening up so you can
},
{
    157.56,161.96
     drop your hips all the way down to the floor and then stretching out your arms
},
{
    161.96,165.72
     going into the child's pose or some people
},
{
    165.72,172.24
     like to bring out their arms first and then sit back into the child's pose or
},
{
    172.24,176.44
     the prayer stretches what we call it sometimes. So you can do either one but
},
{
    176.44,179.8
     this one you actually want to hold that stretch for about 30 seconds so really
},
{
    179.8,185.96
     getting that nice full stretch in there come come back up, kind of let it all stretch out.
},
{
    185.96,190.84
     And the further you can get your bottom down to the floor, the better stretch you're gonna get.
},
{
    190.84,195.42
     So if you want to kind of spread your feet out of the way a little bit, if you have that flexibility, you can do that.
},
{
    195.42,199.34
     Now if you don't have that much flexibility and you're just coming to here, that's fine.
},
{
    199.54,204.6
     You want it to be a comfortable stretch, but feeling the stretch, feeling some tension in there.
},
{
    209.96,217.4
     So then you're gonna go into a kind of a cobra pose and so the cobra pose you're just coming down onto your stomach and then pushing up this way. So
},
{
    217.4,222.76
     just really kind of trying to get that stretch drop the hips down if you can and
},
{
    222.76,226.0
     then really get that pull up there. For this
},
{
    226.0,230.12
     some people might think that's a little bit too much so if you want to start
},
{
    230.12,235.12
     maybe just more like a prop, a prone prop you can do that but if you can
},
{
    235.12,239.76
     eventually kind of come up into that big push-up position that's going to give
},
{
    239.76,245.56
     you that big stretch. So again if you're comfortable doing this, you can hold it for
},
{
    245.56,249.24
     30 seconds, but when you're first starting off, that might just be a little
},
{
    249.24,255.08
     bit too much for you. So doing maybe a five, ten, fifteen seconds. So if you're
},
{
    255.08,258.96
     doing 30 seconds, do three of them. If you're doing the five to ten seconds, do
},
{
    258.96,264.08
     maybe about five of them. So then you're going to roll onto your back and then
},
{
    264.08,267.08
     lie down and get comfortable. And then this time you you're going to roll onto your back and then lie down and get comfortable and then this time
},
{
    267.08,269.08
     you're just going to do a trunk rotation.
},
{
    269.2,275.84
     So bring your knees together, just propping them up, and then you're just going to roll them over to one side.
},
{
    276.0,279.2
     I'm trying to keep my upper back down.
},
{
    279.6,282.34
     The furthest hip away is going to come up,
},
{
    282.4,285.4
     but you should feel that stretch through the hips,
},
{
    285.4,289.3
     kind of that low back down into that tailbone area.
},
{
    289.3,290.88
     And so again, with this one,
},
{
    290.88,294.76
     you can do the 10 to 15 seconds and do it five times,
},
{
    294.76,296.44
     or if you feel like it's a really good stretch,
},
{
    296.44,299.92
     you can do three of a 30 second stretch,
},
{
    299.92,302.32
     but make sure you're doing both sides,
},
{
    302.32,304.32
     so that you're rotating back and forth.
},
{
    304.32,305.68
     You should again feel that stretch,
},
{
    305.68,308.48
     sometimes even all the way up here, down,
},
{
    308.48,310.76
     but a lot in here as well,
},
{
    310.76,313.56
     and just really getting that nice, good stretch.
},
{
    313.56,316.28
     And then the last one is one that I really like
},
{
    316.28,320.16
     to kind of help loosen up the whole hip, pelvic,
},
{
    320.16,324.2
     coccyx, the sacrum area and all that,
},
{
    324.2,326.0
     is just simple bridging.
},
{
    326.0,330.72
     And all bridging is, is you're bringing your hips up off of the floor.
},
{
    330.72,332.64
     And if you can't get down on the floor, that's okay.
},
{
    332.64,334.2
     You can do this on your couch.
},
{
    334.2,335.2
     You can do this on your bed.
},
{
    335.2,337.08
     You can do all these on your couch or your bed.
},
{
    337.08,340.6
     But you're really kind of coming up one segment at a time.
},
{
    340.6,345.76
     You don't have to stop at each segment, but see how I'm rolling my back down.
},
{
    345.76,350.6
     I'm not just coming up and down like this because then I'm not really working that,
},
{
    350.6,355.88
     that pelvis area, that tailbone area down there, but really kind of rolling up. You
},
{
    355.88,359.04
     don't have to go past flat hairs. You don't really want to arch your back because that
},
{
    359.04,364.24
     might be uncomfortable and then nice and slow rolling back down. So you can just start off
},
{
    364.24,365.8
     with maybe 10 of these going nice and slow. You can. So you can just start off with maybe 10 of these
},
{
    365.8,367.48
     going nice and slow.
},
{
    367.48,369.56
     You can do maybe two sets of 10
},
{
    369.56,371.64
     and you can do all these a couple of times a day,
},
{
    371.64,374.12
     maybe two to three times a day.
},
{
    374.12,375.76
     Yeah, so there you have it.
},
{
    375.76,377.36
     Those were my top seven ways to relieve
},
{
    377.36,379.52
     tailbone pain in humans.
