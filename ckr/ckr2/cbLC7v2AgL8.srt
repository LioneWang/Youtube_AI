     Hey everyone, this is Dr. Rohit SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan.
},
{
    26.52,31.68
     This quick easy way to alleviate neck tightness is great because you don't need any equipment
},
{
    31.68,36.44
     and it can literally be done anywhere, home, the office, even in the car.
},
{
    36.44,40.6
     So how you start office, you find the spot in your neck that's hurting you.
},
{
    40.6,43.72
     For this demonstration, I'm just going to find a spot on my right side.
},
{
    43.72,47.76
     You can pretty much go from the ear all the way down into the upper part of the shoulder
},
{
    47.76,48.76
     if you would like.
},
{
    48.76,49.76
     It doesn't matter.
},
{
    49.76,51.4
     Just go over the spot that hurts.
},
{
    51.4,55.3
     So what I'm going to do is more or less just find the spot and then press into it.
},
{
    55.3,59.86
     The key with this, don't press into it so hard that it's actually causing more pain.
},
{
    59.86,64.88
     You just want to find it, give it a good press, and then hold for about five seconds.
},
{
    64.88,69.14
     And then from there, what you're going to do is turn to look over the opposite shoulder
},
{
    69.14,72.92
     and then hold that for another five seconds.
},
{
    72.92,78.5
     And then the last part of this stretch, you're going to more or less bring the chin down
},
{
    78.5,84.68
     towards the opposite shoulder and then hold that for another ten seconds.
},
{
    84.68,88.06
     Okay. and then hold that for another 10 seconds. Okay, so I'm going to show it again.
},
{
    88.06,90.76
     What I'm going to do is just find the spot that hurts in the neck,
},
{
    90.76,95.2
     press into it, but not to the point of pain. Look over the opposite shoulder,
},
{
    95.2,99.52
     and then go down.
},
{
    99.52,104.08
