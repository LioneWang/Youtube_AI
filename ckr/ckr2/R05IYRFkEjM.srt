     Bob and Brad the two most famous physical therapists on the internet

{
    9.6,11.6
     Hi, I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist
},
{
    11.6,12.92
     Brad Heineck physical therapist
},
{
    12.92,15.08
     Together we are the most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    15.08,16.36
     Wow, in our opinion Bob
},
{
    16.36,21.28
     Brad today we thought we'd show you a simple test you can do to determine whether or not you might have a herniated disc
},
{
    21.52,26.96
     It's certainly gonna tell you whether or not you're getting some stress on the nerve root coming out of your back, so real
},
{
    26.96,30.64
     simple let's go ahead and jump right into it, now you're gonna need help with
},
{
    30.64,35.0
     this though, you're gonna need a wife, a spouse, or someone, a friend,
},
{
    35.0,40.64
     someone to you take off the street to help you out here, so Brad's having
},
{
    40.64,48.62
     pain and he's having pain down the right leg, okay and you're wondering is it coming from a herniated disc? Very simple
},
{
    48.62,53.0
     You're gonna do what was called a straight leg raise. There's a French name for it too, but you don't need to know that
},
{
    53.0,57.76
     No, we're not gonna. So what you're gonna do is you're gonna have the toe straight up and you're gonna go ahead and lift it up
},
{
    57.76,59.76
     Now this is you're doing the lifting
},
{
    60.28,62.76
     Brad's not doing the lifting. I'm relaxed. You're relaxed
},
{
    63.0,66.24
     Completely relaxed. Now if he has a herniated disc quite often
},
{
    66.24,70.62
     What I've seen Brad and I'm sure you have too, they start feeling it almost immediately
},
{
    71.0,74.96
     Right at 30 degrees here already. If he starts feeling at that point
},
{
    75.24,80.52
     It's a fairly highly positive sign that you have some encroachment on the nerve
},
{
    80.52,86.24
     Right. It might be a herniated disc, it might be the foramen, something. Now you can go up higher
},
{
    86.24,93.44
     and if it is hurting down there by this time it might be too painful. Right, you might not even be
},
{
    93.44,98.24
     able to go this high, some people may be able to go this high and start to feel it here, that's fine
},
{
    98.24,104.88
     because even at less than 60 degrees or 70 degrees it's still more likely to be a herniated disc. Now
},
{
    104.88,109.2
     what you can do, now you want to distinguish between this and just plain old stretching
},
{
    109.4,112.68
     People are gonna feel stretching with this too, right could be hamstrings
},
{
    112.68,116.46
     Yeah, is it getting worse in the back is it getting worse down the leg is it going into the foot
},
{
    116.46,118.8
     The numbness and tingling is it getting worse
},
{
    119.08,124.3
     But you go up this far and then you can even back off a little bit and then you can go ahead and bend the
},
{
    125.3,128.06
     And then you can even back off a little bit and then you can go ahead and bend the foot forward like this If that makes it worse, it's a good sign
},
{
    128.06,133.34
     It's the nerve being encroached upon and one thing like when Bob was doing that go ahead
},
{
    133.34,137.6
     Let's say I feel a little pain here and when he does that oh it hurts more
},
{
    137.6,143.24
     But it's in the calf right then you don't know but if you do that and it hurts up here
},
{
    143.58,150.4
     Then you're almost certain here or even in the thigh, but it's gonna stretch the calf. So again you
},
{
    150.4,154.64
     just start off very simply you bring it up start to feel pain already good sign
},
{
    154.64,160.64
     it might be a herniated disc, go up here still feeling pain you can go up as high
},
{
    160.64,164.62
     as you go and then back off a little bit and then bend the foot forward and if
},
{
    164.62,165.96
     that increases the pain
},
{
    166.96,168.48
     Especially in the thigh or back
},
{
    168.48,172.48
     Likelihood to be a herniated disc, right and you want to do it on both sides, right
},
{
    172.48,176.32
     Yeah, do a comparative, yeah do a comparison and if he finds out this one
},
{
    176.32,179.76
     Yeah, no pain no problem and that's often a good indication
},
{
    180.28,183.28
     Gold standard of tests anybody can do it. I think
},
{
    184.16,190.0
     Yeah It definitely takes some practice to get better at it but you can play around with it and
},
{
    190.0,192.0
     if it's a bad one you'll see.
},
{
    192.0,195.0
     Yeah and then you can go to your doctor and take it from there.
},
{
    195.0,198.0
     Right, you can say I did the straight leg raise on myself and it's positive.
},
{
    198.0,199.0
     That's right.
},
{
    199.0,201.0
     The doctor rolls eyes.
},
{
    201.0,203.0
     Thanks for watching.
