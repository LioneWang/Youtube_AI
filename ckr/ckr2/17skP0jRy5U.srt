     Hi, I'm Carrie Waiple, certified athletic trainer at Nationwide Children's Sports Medicine.

     Little League elbow is a common problem that plagues young baseball throwers,
},
{
    9.0,14.0
     those especially who throw past the endurance level of the muscles of the forearm.
},
{
    14.0,18.0
     The soft tissue and the growth plates on the inside of the elbow weaken and produce pain.
},
{
    18.0,22.0
     If left untreated, this can produce damage to the joint surface.
},
{
    22.0,27.3
     When our shoulder becomes weak and tired, we tend to drop our arm when we throw,
},
{
    27.3,28.88
     like Markel just did there,
},
{
    28.88,32.32
     creating an excess force on the inside of the elbow.
},
{
    32.32,34.88
     Now when you throw in the normal overhead position,
},
{
    34.88,38.08
     that takes a lot of the force off of the inside of the elbow.
},
{
    38.08,40.6
     It's important for our arms, our core,
},
{
    40.6,42.16
     and our legs to work together
},
{
    42.16,44.4
     to reduce the fatigue on the throwing arm.
},
{
    44.4,49.56
     So some of the exercises that we do here to help prepare the elbow for throwing are elbow
},
{
    49.56,51.66
     curls, excuse me, wrist curls.
},
{
    51.66,55.82
     So in this position he's just bringing his wrist up, strengthening a lot of the muscles
},
{
    55.82,57.3
     on the inside of the elbow.
},
{
    57.3,61.74
     We can also turn the wrist over and do wrist extensions in the same position.
},
{
    61.74,62.74
     Good.
},
{
    62.74,65.64
     Now we're going to put him in a push-up position here,
},
{
    65.64,69.56
     and with his arms, core, hips, and legs engaged,
},
{
    69.56,73.1
     we're going to have him rotate side to side,
},
{
    73.1,75.4
     strengthening all of the muscles in the throwing motion
},
{
    75.4,76.7
     all at once.
},
{
    76.7,77.7
     Okay?
},
{
    77.7,78.86
     So we want him in a nice straight alignment
},
{
    78.86,80.9
     with all of those muscles engaged.
},
{
    80.9,81.9
     Beautiful.
},
{
    81.9,82.9
     Okay.
},
{
    82.9,86.92
     The next exercise is something called a dead bug. In this position
},
{
    86.92,93.72
     we want Markel on his back with his arms extended, and this position looks like a dead bug.
},
{
    93.72,98.28
     Now we're going to rotate side to side, and his core is completely engaged during this
},
{
    98.28,104.0
     exercise as it should be in the throwing motion. Good, thanks Markel. These exercises, it's
},
{
    104.0,105.52
     very important to do these
},
{
    105.52,107.92
     prior to practice, and especially during
},
{
    107.92,109.0
     your non-throwing days.
},
{
    109.0,111.12
     This helps reduce the stress on the elbow.
