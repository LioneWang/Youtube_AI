     Learning about the types of skin cancers and how to recognize skin changes that you should

     Most skin cancer is preventable and if caught early, most can be cured.
},
{
    19.6,26.44
     There are three main kinds of skin cancer, basal cell skin cancer, squamous cell skin cancer, and
},
{
    26.44,28.34
     melanoma.
},
{
    28.34,33.58
     Basal cell skin cancer usually appears on sun exposed areas, most commonly the face and
},
{
    33.58,37.08
     neck, but also on the trunk, arms, and legs.
},
{
    37.08,42.44
     A basal cell skin cancer may look like a firm, flush colored, or red bump.
},
{
    42.44,45.24
     It may have small blood vessels on top.
},
{
    45.24,48.24
     It can appear as an open area or pimple-like growth
},
{
    48.24,51.52
     that bleeds and crests over on an ongoing basis.
},
{
    51.52,54.94
     It can also look like a dry red scaly patch.
},
{
    54.94,57.3
     This is the least dangerous type of skin cancer
},
{
    57.3,59.16
     because it is highly unlikely to spread
},
{
    59.16,61.16
     to other areas of the body.
},
{
    61.16,64.22
     But it should be treated because if you allow it to grow,
},
{
    64.22,67.24
     it can cause further damage to the skin in the area,

{
    67.24,69.94
     look bad, or cause disfigurement.
},
{
    69.94,73.36
     More men than women seem to get this type of skin cancer.
},
{
    73.36,76.0
     Although people in their late teens and early 20s
},
{
    76.0,77.28
     have been seen with it,
},
{
    77.28,79.72
     the rate that it happens increases with age,
},
{
    79.72,82.52
     most frequently affecting those over 50.
},
{
    84.56,91.04
     Squamous cells skin cancer most commonly appears on sun exposed areas such as the head, neck,
},
{
    91.04,93.6
     arm, back of the hand and leg.
},
{
    93.6,97.16
     It can also appear on the rim of the ear or the lip.
},
{
    97.16,103.24
     A squamous cell skin cancer appears as a thickened, red, scaly bump or wart-like growth.
},
{
    103.24,107.48
     It may also look like an open sore or crusted skin that doesn't heal.
},
{
    107.48,112.04
     This type of skin cancer may grow quickly over a period of several weeks, or it may take
},
{
    112.04,113.84
     years to develop.
},
{
    113.84,118.88
     It is seen mostly in people over 50.
},
{
    118.88,124.16
     While basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers are not a serious threat to life, these skin
},
{
    124.16,128.8
     cancers have to be removed by surgery or other treatment methods.
},
{
    128.8,134.52
     Pain and disfigurement can result.

     Melanoma is the least common, but is a potentially deadly type of skin cancer.
},
{
    138.8,144.0
     However, it is important to note that there is a 95% cure rate for melanoma if it is caught
},
{
    144.0,150.8
     early. Melanoma appears most often on the backs of men and legs of women. Melanoma can develop within
},
{
    150.8,158.88
     weeks or months or can be slow growing over several years. Intense sun exposure from time to time,
},
{
    158.88,166.0
     sunburns and especially blistering sunburns in childhood, play a leading role in the development of melanoma.
},
{
    166.0,169.48
     This type of skin cancer can occur in any age group.
},
{
    169.48,174.8
     Fair skinned people who burn easily and those with freckles, red or fair hair and light
},
{
    174.8,177.48
     colored eyes are at greater risk.
},
{
    177.48,182.68
     People with a lot of moles, more than 50 moles, large moles or moles with an unusual color
},
{
    182.68,186.48
     or shape have an increased risk.
},
{
    193.6,195.44
     A simple way to check the skin for melanoma is by using the A, B, C, D, E guide to melanoma diagnosis.
},
{
    199.68,201.36
     A is for a symmetry. One half of the skin lesion is unlike the other.
},
{
    204.8,206.78
     B is for border, an irregular outline.
},
{
    206.78,213.84
     C is for color, a mixture of colors, black, brown, blue, red or white, particularly a change
},
{
    213.84,216.4
     in the color.
},
{
    216.4,222.08
     D is for diameter, larger than 6mm or the diameter of a pencil.
},
{
    222.08,225.76
     Although it is better to diagnose the melanoma before it reaches this size
},
{
    225.76,232.64
     and many melanomas are less than six millimeters in diameter. E is for evolution. Change is in a
},
{
    232.64,238.16
     pigmented spot. If there is a change in the shape, color, or size of a skin lesion or mole,
},
{
    238.16,246.84
     the lesion should be checked by a dermatologist. Melanoma requires surgical removal. Melanoma can be cured if it is found early
},
{
    246.84,254.32
     and removed. While basal cell skin cancer and squamous cell skin cancer arising in sun-damaged
},
{
    254.32,259.4
     skin have a low risk of spreading to other areas of the body, melanoma can spread to
},
{
    259.4,265.88
     other parts of the body and can lead to death. If you are uncertain about a change in your skin, consult
},
{
    265.88,271.44
     a dermatologist. Early detection is critical because if you find a melanoma early, it is
},
{
    271.44,316.0
     curable. Thank you. Music
