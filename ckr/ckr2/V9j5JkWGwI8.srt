     Today I have a really great stretch if you're having a lot of neck and shoulder pain.
},
{
    5.0,13.0
     So this stretch is going to stretch out the levator scapula muscle which gets really, really tight.
},
{
    13.0,18.0
     Especially if you have forward head posture, it's also called upper cross syndrome,
},
{
    18.0,20.0
     round the shoulder kind of posture.
},
{
    20.0,27.96
     That's where the levator scapula gets really, really tight. And it's located, it starts from the top of your shoulder blade
},
{
    27.96,30.36
     and goes all the way up to your neck.
},
{
    30.36,33.16
     Okay, so it kind of comes from here,
},
{
    33.16,35.84
     all the way down to the top of your shoulder blade.
},
{
    35.84,38.88
     And it's the kind of muscle that most people
},
{
    38.88,41.6
     don't realize how tight it gets
},
{
    41.6,43.84
     until they have really tight trigger points.
},
{
    43.84,50.44
     So I'd like to show you two ways you can stretch it. One standing up and one from your office desk
},
{
    50.44,54.76
     if you're sitting on a chair so you can do it anytime while you're working. So
},
{
    54.76,59.76
     you're going to place one hand behind your back just like so okay and you want
},
{
    59.76,66.28
     to press your shoulder down okay. Now take your other hand and place it behind your head and
},
{
    66.28,72.96
     then you want to look towards your right armpit. And then what you want to
},
{
    72.96,79.92
     do is you want to bring your head down, sorry my mic is not cooperating, you want
},
{
    79.92,89.44
     to now bring your head down towards your right pocket and look at your pocket or your armpit,
},
{
    89.44,96.08
     whatever works for you. You want to press gently with your arm down, with the right arm down,
},
{
    96.08,101.36
     while bringing your other arm down as well. So you don't want the shoulder to elevate like this,
},
{
    101.36,109.84
     you want to press it down, okay? And now if I show you from the back so you can see, again, the starting position is you put one arm behind, you're
},
{
    109.84,115.96
     going to take the other one here, you're going to look towards your right armpit, and then
},
{
    115.96,126.44
     you're going to press down towards your right pocket. And you want to hold it there. And now for the other side, we're going to switch.
},
{
    126.96,133.98
     Now place your right arm behind you and press that shoulder down and you're going to now look towards your
},
{
    134.88,136.08
     left
},
{
    136.08,142.04
     arm pit at this point. Bring right arm right in the back here and you want to press down as
},
{
    142.4,145.44
     you're looking at your left pocket this time.
},
{
    148.16,150.48
     You want to keep it there.
},
{
    154.56,162.08
     Now with this stretch because this muscle gets so tight I recommend holding it for at least 30
},
{
    162.08,166.14
     seconds at a time and you should probably do it two to three sets.
},
{
    166.14,167.9
     If it's not that tight, you can do more
},
{
    167.9,169.58
     of the active type of stretching
},
{
    169.58,173.94
     where you're just holding it for a few seconds at a time.
},
{
    173.94,176.52
     But most people, this muscle gets really tight,
},
{
    176.52,178.78
     so I recommend you hold it for longer.
},
{
    178.78,180.66
     Now that I showed you how to do it standing,
},
{
    180.66,182.48
     let me show you how to do it sitting down, okay?
},
{
    182.48,184.08
     So if you're sitting at your desk,
},
{
    184.08,187.32
     the great thing about this stretch is you can do it anytime. You can
},
{
    187.32,191.24
     take breaks from working on your computer just to just doing this stretch.
},
{
    191.24,196.2
     So what you want to do is you want to place one arm behind your underneath
},
{
    196.2,200.16
     your chair, so kind of pressing that shoulder down, and then you want to do
},
{
    200.16,204.28
     the same thing. You're going to rotate your head to one side, place the other one
},
{
    204.28,209.74
     on top, and then you want to look down at your right pocket and kind of assist
},
{
    209.74,216.66
     with the hand. And then to change, just bring this arm on the other side and
},
{
    216.66,222.82
     rotate your head to the other side. Bring the opposite hand on top and again
},
{
    222.82,226.52
     same thing. Push down, look at your left pocket this time
},
{
    226.52,233.16
     holding it 30 seconds two to three sets on each side. I hope this helped you and
},
{
    233.16,239.0
     let me know in the comments section if you found this stretch useful it is one
},
{
    239.0,242.48
     of the best stretches for the levator scapulae and most people when they do
},
{
    242.48,246.36
     this stretch it's like an aha moment. It's like, whoa, because they feel it right away.
},
{
    246.36,250.04
     They feel it lengthening and releasing right away,
},
{
    250.04,253.24
     right after, and it's a really great stretch.
},
{
    253.24,255.4
     I'd recommend you do it almost daily,
},
{
    255.4,257.6
     because again, most of us suffering
},
{
    257.6,259.4
     from our forward head posture,
},
{
    259.4,261.72
     our head comes forward this way,
},
{
    261.72,268.46
     and it puts a lot of pressure on that muscle specifically. so that's why stretching it almost daily is gonna be really
},
{
    268.46,273.12
     important if you don't want to have that tightness and those trigger points
},
{
    273.12,278.68
     forming in the upper neck and shoulder area. Alright that's it for today we
