},
{
    23.36,27.96
     Tartar sauce might be great on your fish, but nobody likes to have tartar on their teeth.
},
{
    27.96,32.68
     And I'm talking about bacteria-filled plaque that hardens and stains your pearly whites.
},
{
    32.68,36.76
     When not removed, it becomes rough and can actually lead to gum disease.
},
{
    36.76,41.04
     Not to mention, those yellow stains can make you feel pretty self-conscious about your smile.
},
{
    41.04,44.76
     But don't worry, you've got everything you need to pulverize that plaque right in your
},
{
    44.76,45.76
     kitchen.

     Here are 10 totally natural ways to get rid of tartar buildup from your teeth.

     Number 10. Baking Soda and Salt
},
{
    68.88,72.64
     You can start with this simple yet effective method of tartar removal.
},
{
    72.64,77.84
     Mix 1 tablespoon of baking soda with a pinch of salt and put some of this mixture on your toothbrush.
},
{
    77.84,82.08
     Alternatively, you can add it to your regular toothpaste too. Just don't brush your teeth
},
{
    82.08,86.68
     with baking soda more than once a week since its abrasiveness can damage your enamel.
},
{
    86.68,91.16
     Besides helping you out in the struggle against tartar, baking soda has a number of other oral
},
{
    91.16,96.88
     health benefits. It supports healthy oral pH levels, its antimicrobial properties reduce
},
{
    96.88,101.48
     the number of harmful bacteria in your mouth, and it helps remove stains from your teeth,
},
{
    101.48,104.4
     giving you a wider, brighter smile.
},
{
    104.4,108.2
     Now a lot of people think baking soda is dangerous to use on your teeth because it
},
{
    108.2,109.68
     contains aluminum.
},
{
    109.68,112.72
     This is nothing more than a common misconception.
},
{
    112.72,115.32
     Baking soda does not contain any aluminum.
},
{
    115.32,118.72
     What does contain aluminum, though, is some types of baking powder.
},
{
    118.72,122.52
     And they don't even have pure aluminum, just aluminum derivatives.
},
{
    122.52,127.4
     Still, baking soda is pretty abrasive, so again, don't use it more than once a week
},
{
    127.4,132.28
     on your teeth.
},
{
    132.28,133.48
     Number 9.
},
{
    133.48,136.0
     Orange Peel
},
{
    136.0,138.98
     You ever wonder what to do with orange peel leftovers?
},
{
    138.98,141.4
     Such a shame to just throw them away, you know?
},
{
    141.4,142.96
     Well, waste no more.
},
{
    142.96,148.6
     If you're looking to get rid of stains and tartar buildup from your teeth, simply rub the white part of the peel directly over
},
{
    148.6,153.76
     your teeth for 2-3 minutes. You can also make a paste and apply it to your teeth.
},
{
    153.76,158.04
     Whichever you choose, rinse your mouth with lukewarm water afterwards. You can use orange
},
{
    158.04,162.88
     peel on your teeth about 2-3 times a week. Citrus fruits are generally good at removing
},
{
    162.88,171.72
     plaque stains because they contain acids. Orange peel in particular contains soluble fiber, vitamin C, pectin, and limonene. These
},
{
    171.72,176.1
     elements serve as sort of a prevention in that they fight food debris that otherwise accumulates
},
{
    176.1,182.04
     on your teeth. Besides, some of these components serve as natural whiteners. For example, limonene
},
{
    182.04,185.52
     is a compounding many teeth whitening products.
},
{
    185.52,188.84
     Another advantage of using orange peel to keep your teeth healthy is the fact that it's
},
{
    188.84,194.4
     not as acidic as the fruit itself, so it doesn't erode your enamel.
},
{
    194.4,195.4
     Number 8.
},
{
    195.4,198.48
     Lemon Juice
},
{
    198.48,202.64
     Replace orange peel with lemon juice if you want better and faster results.
},
{
    202.64,207.68
     Lemon acids not only dissolve plaque but also whiten teeth more effectively than orange peel.
},
{
    207.68,209.52
     Dip your toothbrush in fresh lemon juice
},
{
    209.52,211.32
     and gently rub it over the teeth.
},
{
    211.32,213.68
     Leave it on for a minute before rinsing.
},
{
    213.68,214.98
     Since it's more abrasive,
},
{
    214.98,217.98
     you should only use this method once every two weeks.
},
{
    217.98,220.38
     Otherwise, you can really harm your teeth.
},
{
    220.38,222.36
     Also, if you have sensitive teeth,
},
{
    222.36,223.96
     you should probably choose another way
},
{
    223.96,225.76
     of removing dental plaque. Lemon juice contains too much citric acid, which can have sensitive teeth, you should probably choose another way of removing dental plaque.
},
{
    225.76,229.84
     Lemon juice contains too much citric acid, which can make your teeth become painful and
},
{
    229.84,231.32
     overly sensitive.
},
{
    231.32,236.08
     In some cases, it can also deprive your teeth of calcium, and that's a serious problem,
},
{
    236.08,240.64
     since lost calcium can't be replaced.
},
{
    240.64,241.96
     Number 7.
},
{
    241.96,248.32
     Sesame Seeds Sesame seeds have so many uses outside of the kitchen. You
},
{
    248.32,252.6
     can use them against hair loss, for wound healing, preventing bug bites, treating
},
{
    252.6,257.6
     frostbite, and of course removing tartar. They act as a natural scrub that both
},
{
    257.6,261.72
     polishes and cleans your teeth. All you've got to do is chew on one full
},
{
    261.72,267.88
     tablespoon of seeds. Now you want to create a kind of paste in your mouth without swallowing it in the process.
},
{
    267.88,271.64
     After you've successfully completed this challenge, take a dry toothbrush and brush
},
{
    271.64,273.16
     your teeth with paste.
},
{
    273.16,275.26
     You can use this method twice a week.
},
{
    275.26,279.62
     An additional benefit of sesame seeds is their ability to lower the number of streptococcus
},
{
    279.62,281.52
     bacteria in your mouth.
},
{
    281.52,285.7
     That is that nasty, highly contagious strand of bacteria that gives you strep throat.
},
{
    285.7,289.78
     Number 6. Hydrogen Peroxide and Mouthwash
},
{
    289.78,296.12
     Since both of these ingredients have highly effective antibacterial properties, they make
},
{
    296.12,301.68
     a great team when combined. Mix one tablespoon of antiseptic mouthwash with three tablespoons
},
{
    301.68,305.66
     of 3% hydrogen peroxide solution. Gargle this mixture for
},
{
    305.66,310.32
     a couple of minutes and follow it up with clean water. Hydrogen peroxide has an additional
},
{
    310.32,315.64
     benefit of being a teeth whitener. You can use it as such in two ways, either as a rinse
},
{
    315.64,320.38
     or as a paste. In the second case, mix it with 2 teaspoons of baking soda and leave
},
{
    320.38,325.98
     the resulting concoction on your teeth for 2-3 minutes. After that, rinse the paste off with water.
},
{
    327.88,329.92
     Number five, coconut oil.
},
{
    331.36,333.52
     Another thing you can reach for in your kitchen cupboard
},
{
    333.52,335.36
     is coconut oil.
},
{
    335.36,337.92
     In a popular procedure called oil pulling,
},
{
    337.92,340.46
     the coconut oil absorbs dirt in the mouth,
},
{
    340.46,342.32
     reduces tartar and plaque,
},
{
    342.32,344.2
     and helps you get rid of bad breath.
},
{
    344.2,345.16
     On top of that, it
},
{
    345.16,348.72
     also has an antibacterial effect against all the microorganisms that have
},
{
    348.72,353.24
     decided to call your mouth their home. Swish one or two tablespoons of coconut
},
{
    353.24,357.4
     oil around in your mouth for 10 to 15 minutes. Don't worry, it tastes great.
},
{
    357.4,361.6
     Then spit it out and rinse well with warm water.
},
{
    361.6,366.88
     Number four, strawberries and tomatoes. Bothberries and Tomatoes
},
{
    366.88,371.12
     Both tomatoes and strawberries are rich in vitamin C, so you can use them if lemons or
},
{
    371.12,372.84
     oranges aren't your thing.
},
{
    372.84,376.72
     Chop up and blend either of them into a paste and put it on your teeth.
},
{
    376.72,379.98
     Leave it there for 5 minutes, then rinse your mouth out with water.
},
{
    379.98,385.08
     On the other hand, you should be extra careful with strawberries if you have sensitive teeth.
},
{
    385.08,388.32
     Strawberries contain a sorbic acid, which can harm your enamel.
},
{
    388.32,393.08
     If you still go for this method, it's recommended to use fluoride toothpaste to brush your teeth
},
{
    393.08,397.44
     right after you rinse your mouth.
},
{
    397.44,399.0
     Number 3.
},
{
    399.0,402.0
     Aloe vera and glycerin
},
{
    402.0,407.96
     This combination is a whole concoction of goodness for your teeth. Mix one teaspoon of pure aloe vera gel,
},
{
    407.96,410.12
     four teaspoons of vegetable glycerin,
},
{
    410.12,412.12
     ten drops of lemon essential oil,
},
{
    412.12,414.12
     and four tablespoons of baking soda
},
{
    414.12,416.88
     in one cup of water to get a smooth paste.
},
{
    416.88,419.44
     Brush your teeth with this paste once a day
},
{
    419.44,421.88
     until you see the tartar becoming less visible.
},
{
    421.88,424.24
     Repeat this procedure every three to four days.
},
{
    424.24,429.28
     Aloe vera helps teeth and gums heal while essential lemon oil fights bacteria.
},
{
    431.6,433.04
     Number two, cloves.
},
{
    435.6,440.72
     This spice has long been used as a pain remedy for toothache. It also kills oral bacteria.
},
{
    441.68,445.36
     Grind the cloves or find a ready-made powder, add a little olive oil,
},
{
    445.36,449.6
     and apply the mixture to the stained areas. One more way you can use cloves is
},
{
    449.6,453.56
     to regularly chew on them to reduce bad breath caused by bacteria in the mouth.
},
{
    453.56,462.0
     Try it instead of your usual chewing gum. Number one, Sanguine area. Now here's a
},
{
    462.0,465.48
     bit of an unusual tartar removing method.
},
{
    465.48,468.4
     Sanguinaria is a plant more commonly known as blood root.
},
{
    468.4,471.3
     But it's not as weird as it seems at first glance.
},
{
    471.3,473.52
     Blood root extract is often included in toothpaste.
},
{
    473.52,477.88
     It's a safe antibacterial agent effective for reducing tartar.
},
{
    477.88,483.12
     Just add three or four drops of sanguinaria extract to a cup of warm water to make a mouthwash.
},
{
    483.12,485.44
     It can be gargled every day or even twice a day.
},
{
    486.0,491.04
     All these natural remedies can work if your tartar buildup hasn't reached critical levels yet.
},
{
    491.04,495.76
     If it has, or if you have super sensitive teeth that react strongly to acids,
},
{
    495.76,499.04
     please consult your dentist before trying any of these methods.
},
{
    499.04,503.52
     There are special ways of removing plaque and tartar from teeth that can only be performed by

{
    503.52,507.72
     the pros. Have you ever used any of these recipes to remove tartar?
