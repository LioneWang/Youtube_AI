     Hey everybody it's Doctor Jo and Bee Remy. Isn't she the bee's knees? Or in this case today the
},
{
    7.6,13.44
     bee's ankles. Today I'm going to show you seven ways to treat an ankle sprain. So let's get started!
},
{
    15.44,17.36
     Disclaimer alert, disclaimer alert.
},
{
    20.32,28.4
     So these treatments are for an ankle sprain that's early on. So when you just want to start getting some movement but nothing too strenuous quite yet, you're
},
{
    28.4,30.96
     just trying to get that movement to help get some of that swelling out of there
},
{
    30.96,35.8
     and that irritation out of there. So one of the first ways to start is a really
},
{
    35.8,40.24
     great thing to do is stretching out your calves because if you've got an ankle
},
{
    40.24,45.58
     injury or a sprain a lot of times your calves will tighten up. So an easy way to
},
{
    45.58,48.58
     stretch the calves and you can stretch your calves a whole bunch of different
},
{
    48.58,52.78
     ways is just using a strap to stretch it. I like putting a little roll
},
{
    52.78,57.88
     underneath my ankle right there because then I have movement in that heel. You
},
{
    57.88,61.02
     don't have to but I think you'll just get a better stretch, better movement when
},
{
    61.02,69.4
     you do that. So or you can just prop it off the edge of a couch or a bed or off of a table if you want to just so you have that movement in
},
{
    69.4,75.16
     there. So take something like a stretch strap or a dog leash but lots of times it
},
{
    75.16,79.4
     has a loop that works the best. You want to put it around the ball of your foot.
},
{
    79.4,82.48
     You don't want to be high up on your toes because it's probably gonna slip off.
},
{
    82.48,85.88
     You don't want it to be low down by your arch because then you're not going to get a
},
{
    85.88,91.44
     really good stretch. So you want to completely relax your foot. You're doing
},
{
    91.44,96.2
     all the stretching or the movement with the strap that you have. So I'm just
},
{
    96.2,102.96
     going to pull and get that stretch. So right now I'm feeling a stretch underneath
},
{
    102.96,106.18
     where the calf muscles are. So depending
},
{
    106.18,109.9
     on your sprain, depending on how much irritation you have in there, you might
},
{
    109.9,113.46
     not be able to pull very hard, but with a stretch you don't want it to be painful,
},
{
    113.46,117.5
     you want it to be comfortable, so just get that nice tension feeling but no
},
{
    117.5,120.4
     pain while you're doing the stretch. You want to hold that stretch for 30
},
{
    120.4,125.0
     seconds, relax, and then do that a total of three times.
},
{
    125.08,127.64
     So you can do the stretches several times throughout the day
},
{
    127.64,129.96
     as long as it's not irritating it.
},
{
    129.96,131.92
     So then the next one that you're gonna do
},
{
    131.92,135.0
     is just what you would call ankle circles.
},
{
    135.0,139.0
     So again, having it where your heel is not touching the floor
},
{
    139.0,140.16
     or touching something is best
},
{
    140.16,142.44
     because then you're gonna have more movement in your ankle.
},
{
    142.44,149.44
     If I just had it on the floor, I can still do it, but it's just a little bit harder to get that motion in there. So the ankle
},
{
    149.44,155.6
     circles are just exactly how they sound. You're just going to try and make a circle at your ankle,
},
{
    155.6,162.64
     but it's not your whole leg. You're not moving like this. The leg part should be staying still,
},
{
    162.64,167.92
     and you should really try and get that movement at that ankle because what you're doing is with the sprain you're trying to keep
},
{
    167.92,171.92
     that movement so it doesn't scar up and tighten up but you're not trying to do a
},
{
    171.92,174.8
     lot of movement where you're just going to irritate it more so you have to kind
},
{
    174.8,178.28
     of find that happy middle ground but movement just at the ankle so you're
},
{
    178.28,188.08
     making I would say 10 circles one way and then reverse it and do ten circles the other way. So same
},
{
    188.08,191.84
     kind of thing. You can do ten, you can do two sets of ten of each, but you can do
},
{
    191.84,194.68
     this several times throughout the day as long as you feel like it's not
},
{
    194.68,198.16
     irritating it even more. So you just have to, it depends on what grade your
},
{
    198.16,203.24
     sprain is. It's a little bit different for everybody. So then the next one is just
},
{
    203.24,205.76
     using something like an ankle wrap.
},
{
    205.76,209.96
     An ankle wraps are really great because not only does it give it a little bit of
},
{
    209.96,214.32
     a support, but it also gives you some compression. So if you have some swelling
},
{
    214.32,220.12
     in there, it helps work it out. So I'm going to use the ankle wrap from Brace
},
{
    220.12,224.44
     Ability and this is their neoprene ankle wrap. And it's really nice because again,
},
{
    224.44,229.14
     it's not a brace per se. It's not going to stabilizerene ankle wrap and it's really nice because again it's not a brace per se it's not gonna stabilize your ankle but it's
},
{
    229.14,234.86
     enough just to give compression in there and so all wraps or some sometimes
},
{
    234.86,239.26
     they are called braces are a little bit different but most of the time it wraps
},
{
    239.26,243.62
     around your ankle and then you have two straps that kind of cross and so that's
},
{
    243.62,245.56
     usually the way most of them work.
},
{
    245.56,247.92
     They've got a little opening for your heel,
},
{
    247.92,250.46
     which is nice because you can just kind of put your heel
},
{
    250.46,253.46
     there and get your foot flat on the ground.
},
{
    253.46,255.22
     Now, generally, if you're sitting,
},
{
    255.22,257.78
     that's a little bit better because you want to have
},
{
    257.78,259.82
     your ankle kind of in that neutral position
},
{
    259.82,261.18
     if you can get it there.
},
{
    261.18,263.8
     Since I'm on the floor, I'm gonna show you this way.
},
{
    263.8,268.16
     But you'd usually start the wrap at the bottom first so you can get that nice
},
{
    268.16,272.12
     and stabilized. And so then if you wanted to put your heel up like that you can
},
{
    272.12,276.24
     again to get it in that neutral position so it's not sitting down like this it's
},
{
    276.24,280.94
     nice and up and then you're gonna come and bring the part up around your
},
{
    280.94,286.0
     ankle. So you want it to be pretty firm, but you want to be able to
},
{
    286.0,289.68
     easily slide two fingers underneath because you don't want it to be so tight
},
{
    289.68,294.16
     that you're cutting off all circulation, but you want it to be pretty firm so
},
{
    294.16,297.4
     then you're getting that compression you need to get that swelling out of there.
},
{
    297.4,300.72
     And a lot of times that compression just feels really nice. It's just like a hug.
},
{
    300.72,309.12
     I usually like to do the inside strap first because that just helps hold up the arch and you're gonna cross it over so you're making that
},
{
    309.12,313.0
     cross pattern and then you're gonna take the other one and cross it the other
},
{
    313.0,317.36
     way. So then it gives you that a little bit of a support right there through the
},
{
    317.36,320.76
     ankle. So again it's not necessarily a brace it's not stopping the movement. You
},
{
    320.76,324.48
     don't really want to stop the movement unless you've gone to your doctor and
},
{
    324.48,328.48
     they want you in something that's actually stopping it because movement is going to help with the
},
{
    328.48,333.04
     sprain. You don't want to completely not move it unless you've got a really big sprain like a grade
},
{
    333.04,337.84
     three or something and your doctor has told you not to mobilize it at all. But see again this works
},
{
    337.84,343.12
     really well because it gives you that support that you need but then it also just kind of helps
},
{
    343.12,345.72
     with that compression to get that swelling out of there.
},
{
    345.72,348.62
     So if you're interested in purchasing the wrap or anything else from Braceability, make
},
{
    348.62,350.88
     sure and click on the link up there.
},
{
    350.88,354.12
     So I'm going to go ahead and take this off to do the rest of my stuff.
},
{
    354.12,359.08
     A lot of times people do ask, should I wear the wrap or should I wear the brace while
},
{
    359.08,360.96
     I'm doing the exercises?
},
{
    360.96,367.0
     I personally, if you're doing therapy type exercises, I would say no. If it's not
},
{
    367.0,370.84
     increasing the pain while you're doing it, you want your muscles to really try and do
},
{
    370.84,374.84
     the work. You're wearing that wrap. Maybe if you're doing something a little more high
},
{
    374.84,380.2
     level, you know, maybe trying to bike or run or something like that, that's when you have
},
{
    380.2,383.72
     the wrap on there or just in general to get that swelling out of there. But if you're
},
{
    383.72,387.08
     doing your therapeutic exercises, if you can, I would do it
},
{
    387.08,392.04
     without them. So the next one is just an ankle pump. So it's kind of just like it
},
{
    392.04,396.94
     sounds. So you're pushing down as far as you can and then coming up as far as you
},
{
    396.94,399.88
     can. So same thing, I like to have something underneath just so I have
},
{
    399.88,404.52
     that movement. Ankle pumps are great. You can do them with your foot out in front
},
{
    404.52,408.04
     of you. You can do them lying down. You can even do them sitting in a chair, which
},
{
    408.04,411.8
     is nice because if you're at work or something and you're sitting or you're
},
{
    411.8,416.0
     standing, a lot of times that swelling just follows gravity and it hangs out by
},
{
    416.0,421.6
     the ankle. But an ankle pump works really nicely to make your calf muscle almost
},
{
    421.6,429.66
     like a natural pump. That's what I call call it ankle pumps, to pump that irritation, that fluid, that swelling back out into your body so it
},
{
    429.66,433.96
     gets out of your system and it doesn't just pull up at your ankle. So generally
},
{
    433.96,438.16
     you can do you know 10 reps, two sets of 10, but you can really do these all
},
{
    438.16,443.1
     throughout the day. Again if it's not irritating it then you can do it several
},
{
    443.1,448.84
     times throughout the day. You don't just have to go, oh I'm just doing you know one or two times a day. So then the
},
{
    448.84,453.8
     next one is an ankle eversion and inversion movement. And a lot of times
},
{
    453.8,457.92
     if you have this ankle sprain it's on the outside or the inside. So this one
},
{
    457.92,462.16
     might be a little bit more uncomfortable. So again just work in your pain-free
},
{
    462.16,467.72
     motion. It's just like the circles where you want your leg to stay still.
},
{
    467.72,470.56
     You want all the movement to be at your ankle.
},
{
    470.56,474.52
     So I'm just going to turn it out and then come back in.
},
{
    474.52,478.76
     So sometimes people call these windshield wipers where you're just kind of sweeping back and
},
{
    478.76,483.6
     forth like a windshield wiper, but we call it inversion going this way and eversion going
},
{
    483.6,484.6
     that way.
},
{
    484.6,487.68
     Or you can say, you know, windshield wipersispers but you're not doing this the whole leg's not
},
{
    487.68,493.36
     moving you're really trying to get that movement mostly at the ankle again to
},
{
    493.36,497.28
     keep it from scarring up to start getting some movement in there getting
},
{
    497.28,503.16
     that swelling and irritation out of there so then the next one is just really
},
{
    503.16,506.64
     kind of I'm gonna I'm gonna switch to this side so you can do see what I'm doing
},
{
    506.64,508.36
     So this one would be my ankle spring now
},
{
    508.36,513.98
     It's just to kind of stretch out the bottom of the foot a lot of times when you have an ankle spring
},
{
    514.32,520.56
     Everything gets tightened up here because you're not moving your ankle how you're supposed to so sometimes like plant or fasciitis tries to
},
{
    521.04,522.18
     Creep in a little bit
},
{
    522.18,525.64
     So just taking your toes and stretching them up
},
{
    525.64,530.08
     like this so you're kind of doing this movement with your hands and then you can
},
{
    530.08,533.8
     just kind of pull at your heel too so you're kind of pulling up into that
},
{
    533.8,538.6
     dorsiflexion motion with your toes to help stretch out the bottom of your
},
{
    538.6,542.98
     foot because again if you're getting swelling irritation at your ankle the
},
{
    542.98,550.16
     real the whole foot is going to be involved. So you really want to kind of stretch this whole area out as well. And so again it's nice to kind
},
{
    550.16,555.68
     of do you can do a full 30 second hold stretching it out or if that's a little bit too much you
},
{
    555.68,560.56
     know just do a 10 to 15. So if you're doing 10 to 15 seconds do it about five times kind of getting
},
{
    560.56,567.52
     it stretched out moving the whole thing but if you're doing that full 30 second hold you can just do that three times several times
},
{
    567.52,572.12
     throughout the day. And then once you really kind of have everything stretched
},
{
    572.12,576.06
     out if you want to do some really gentle strengthening maybe with like a
},
{
    576.06,581.72
     resistive band you can. Be very careful about this depending on again how
},
{
    581.72,587.68
     recent your sprain is what grade your sprain is you know you really probably want to talk to your doctor or physical therapist first to
},
{
    587.68,591.12
     progress how you should because if you go and start doing too much you're just
},
{
    591.12,595.96
     going to make it worse. So I like the resistive bands putting a little bit of
},
{
    595.96,599.92
     a loop on it just to kind of help get the movement. Make sure you know your
},
{
    599.92,604.56
     colors, different colors or different resistances. For this particular one
},
{
    604.56,608.12
     this is kind of the second one up but you always want to start with the lightest
},
{
    608.12,611.56
     one, so just make sure you're checking whatever kind of brand of a band that you
},
{
    611.56,615.56
     have. So again, you want to put it around the ball of your foot because if it's up
},
{
    615.56,619.0
     on your toes, it might come back and smack you, and if it's down at your arch,
},
{
    619.0,623.36
     you're really not going to get quite as much. If you don't have shoes on, sometimes
},
{
    623.36,625.16
     I do like to kind of spread the band out just so it doesn't slide as much. If you don't have shoes on sometimes I do like to kind of spread
},
{
    625.16,629.0
     the band out just so it doesn't slide as much. And so all you're gonna do this is
},
{
    629.0,632.32
     kind of like the ankle pump except now you have the resistance. So now you're
},
{
    632.32,636.08
     just gonna push down and see how it rolled just a little bit. So sometimes if
},
{
    636.08,639.48
     you've just got your socks on you might have to you know put it a little bit
},
{
    639.48,642.4
     above the ball of your foot as well. So just kind of check it out and if you
},
{
    642.4,646.0
     need to do this with your shoes on you can do it with your shoes on as well. But just
},
{
    646.0,650.48
     pushing down but the key is when you come back up. Don't just let it bounce
},
{
    650.48,654.64
     back up. You want to control the band. Don't let the band control you but try and
},
{
    654.64,660.08
     go slow and controlled. So if your foot's doing like this when you come up, if it's
},
{
    660.08,663.92
     wiggling, you probably have too much resistance. So either don't put as much
},
{
    663.92,665.2
     tension on there,
},
{
    665.2,666.64
     or just try and do them again,
},
{
    666.64,668.8
     the ankle pumps without the resistive band,
},
{
    668.8,670.84
     or if you're higher up, make sure then you go down
},
{
    670.84,672.28
     to a less resistive band.
},
{
    672.28,675.72
     So again, you can kind of start off with,
},
{
    675.72,678.4
     you know, 10, 10's a good number to start with,
},
{
    678.4,680.44
     but if you're getting to five,
},
{
    680.44,683.48
     and then it starts doing this, don't try and push through it
},
{
    683.48,687.76
     because that means those muscles are fatigued and you don't want to over fatigued. So there you have it
},
{
    687.76,693.08
     those are my seven ways to treat an ankle sprain. Isn't that good Ms. B's? And if you'd
