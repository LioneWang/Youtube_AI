     Bob and Brad, the two most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    9.52,12.8
     Hi, I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist, Brad Heineck physical therapist
},
{
    12.8,16.04
     Because we are the most famous physical therapists on the internet, in our opinion of course Bob
},
{
    16.04,20.04
     Brad we've done a video on this before but we're gonna do kind of a comprehensive one
},
{
    20.36,24.92
     This is on Tenacellbel and these are the absolute best treatments stretches and
},
{
    25.78,32.32
     Exercises you can do in our opinion. Yep. So and you've had tenicellabal on both arms. So you you're you're a good subject
},
{
    32.32,37.4
     Yeah, it's a very painful when it's in and it's you know, it's right up
},
{
    37.4,40.28
     It's painful and it limits you a lot people
},
{
    40.28,45.72
     I think they're shocked how much it hurts and And the thing about this is you look perfectly healthy.
},
{
    45.72,47.44
     It looks perfectly fine.
},
{
    47.44,49.36
     And you can just do the smallest little motion,
},
{
    49.36,52.28
     like opening a door, and it just will bite,
},
{
    52.28,53.96
     and it lets you know it right now.
},
{
    53.96,55.28
     Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
},
{
    55.28,57.12
     All right, so the first thing is,
},
{
    57.12,58.48
     normally what it involves,
},
{
    58.48,60.76
     it is the muscle going into the tendon
},
{
    60.76,62.4
     and attaching to the bone here,
},
{
    62.4,64.8
     nine times out of 10, that's what it is.
},
{
    64.8,67.86
     And generally a lot of times it's gonna hurt
},
{
    67.86,70.62
     when you squeeze your hand or bring your wrist up
},
{
    70.62,72.74
     or deviate a little bit this way.
},
{
    72.74,74.78
     That's the indicator, because it'll hurt down there.
},
{
    74.78,76.94
     Those muscles go all the way down the forearm.
},
{
    76.94,77.78
     So, yeah.
},
{
    77.78,79.46
     And one thing I do when I have a patient,
},
{
    79.46,81.74
     I'll feel on that bone.
},
{
    81.74,84.18
     And usually where that bone is that connects,
},
{
    84.18,85.6
     very tender spot in there.
},
{
    85.6,90.24
     Alright so you're going to start off with ice massage. I mean and maybe this is something
},
{
    90.24,91.88
     you've done already Brad, do you want to show how that's done?
},
{
    91.88,96.76
     Yep, you can just take direct ice, fill a cup up, it can be styrofoam or paper. Bob likes to
},
{
    96.76,99.68
     start off with them, I like paper ones better but it doesn't matter, fill it about this high,
},
{
    99.68,105.52
     put it in the freezer so it doesn't tip over, freeze it solid and then peel away
},
{
    106.32,111.28
     the top. So you have some ice exposed, you can rub the ice to get the sharp edges off
},
{
    111.28,116.16
     and go right over that area. I usually rub for five minutes, the first one or two minutes it
},
{
    116.16,120.96
     kind of burns and is a little uncomfortable but then it goes numb, skin turns red and at five
},
{
    120.96,124.72
     minutes and I think you even do a little less than that don't you Bob? Yeah I mean if you're
},
{
    124.72,128.48
     really busy you can probably do it in two three minutes. It's gonna help. So sure. Yeah, it's gonna help
},
{
    128.84,133.46
     The second thing that you may want to go ahead and invest in a brace a tennis elbow brace
},
{
    133.46,138.56
     Yeah, I like the one by aircast here just me personally Brad. It's worked well with patients
},
{
    138.6,142.1
     It's nice these they have a bladder on a little air bubble thing there
},
{
    142.1,145.4
     And you usually put that over the sore area
},
{
    145.4,147.28
     and on the muscle belly just in front of it.
},
{
    147.28,148.96
     So if right there was a sore spot,
},
{
    148.96,150.6
     we're gonna go right in front of it,
},
{
    150.6,152.04
     and you'll know, because when you're on it
},
{
    152.04,152.88
     and you tighten this up.
},
{
    152.88,154.24
     Yeah, you're not on the sore area,
},
{
    154.24,156.68
     just a little bit off of it more towards the hands.
},
{
    156.68,157.52
     Exactly.
},
{
    157.52,158.92
     I thought I said that.
},
{
    158.92,159.76
     It was a little confusing.
},
{
    159.76,161.48
     I know I didn't say it very well, did I?
},
{
    161.48,163.12
     But what you're trying to do is take,
},
{
    163.12,167.08
     you know, the muscle, the stress of the muscle now is a little bit
},
{
    167.08,169.36
     more right here instead of where it attaches.
},
{
    169.36,171.44
     Right, kinda spreads it out.
},
{
    171.44,172.72
     Did you use a brace pad or not?
},
{
    172.72,176.24
     Yeah, I used one and one thing I found within other people,
},
{
    176.24,179.22
     some patients of mine, is to get it in the right spot,
},
{
    179.22,180.48
     sometimes when you're working,
},
{
    180.48,183.68
     if you're working that physical type job and you bend it,
},
{
    183.68,185.24
     it will get in the crux of your elbow
},
{
    185.24,190.1
     And it's uncomfortable so then it would kind of bother you and it all depends on your situation
},
{
    190.1,196.1
     But they are helpful. It doesn't take away the problem, but it seems to help.
},
{
    196.1,199.6
     At least you can work with it as long as your elbow is not real flexed a lot.
},
{
    199.6,203.0
     Okay, first treatment you may want to do just to Bob just wait.
},
{
    204.12,208.0
     Right over here. Oh. Oh yeah by the way before we go any further we want to make sure
},
{
    208.0,212.0
     a lot of people are new to our channel. Want to make sure if you have a minute just go ahead.

{
    212.0,216.0

     that can be helpful to you and help you stay fame-free, fit,
},
{
    224.0,226.26
     healthy, etc., et cetera.
},
{
    226.26,228.1
     And we appreciate it, so let's go on.
},
{
    228.1,229.42
     All right, moving on.
},
{
    229.42,232.7
     This is a very low level exercise,
},
{
    232.7,234.7
     but just to start putting a little bit of stress
},
{
    234.7,237.1
     on the area without making it worse.
},
{
    237.1,238.62
     So all you're gonna do is,
},
{
    238.62,240.94
     every, you know, throughout the day,
},
{
    240.94,242.3
     you can do this every hour, in fact,
},
{
    242.3,243.38
     is all you're gonna do is lift your,
},
{
    243.38,245.4
     make a fist and squeeze. And you're gonna do is lift your, make a fist and squeeze.
},
{
    245.4,246.56
     And you're gonna feel a little bit of pain,
},
{
    246.56,248.12
     but that's okay.
},
{
    248.12,249.04
     Squeeze.
},
{
    249.04,250.32
     You don't wanna get it to the sharp pain,
},
{
    250.32,251.16
     but a little bit.
},
{
    251.16,253.56
     You do this 10 times, like I said,
},
{
    253.56,255.28
     four to five times a day.
},
{
    255.28,257.2
     And you notice he's got his wrist up,
},
{
    257.2,258.36
     we call that extended,
},
{
    258.36,260.28
     that's the extended position of the wrist.
},
{
    260.28,263.16
     And that's where you want it, not like this.
},
{
    263.16,268.3
     All right, now this next one is one that we've found a lot of people have had a lot of help with.
},
{
    268.3,270.22
     Lonnie, can you throw me a pillow?
},
{
    270.22,271.58
     There's one over there.
},
{
    271.58,273.98
     He meant to say a lot of success.
},
{
    273.98,275.46
     What did I say? Help.
},
{
    275.46,277.9
     Oh, well it's kind of true too.
},
{
    277.9,281.98
     But it has been a nice, and it's not real hard to do, you can do it to yourself.
},
{
    281.98,287.96
     So what we're going to do is cross fiber friction massage, you're going to find the spot here in the right
},
{
    287.96,290.92
     off the bone and you're going to move a little bit more towards the hand and
},
{
    290.92,294.04
     that's usually the spot where you're going to do this and you're going to
},
{
    294.04,298.64
     take one finger or two fingers you're going to go across the fibers. The
},
{
    298.64,302.04
     fibers of the muscles go this way so we're going to take in the massage and
},
{
    302.04,307.68
     go this way. And what this does because a lot of times what has happened over time is that scar tissue
},
{
    307.68,311.72
     has formed in that tendon or even a little bit in the muscle brand.
},
{
    311.72,316.36
     And that scar tissue is very weak and it breaks open very easily.
},
{
    316.36,320.28
     So what happens is it starts to heal and you think, oh it's getting better and then you
},
{
    320.28,323.04
     use it and it breaks open and it starts all over again.
},
{
    323.04,325.22
     So this helps it heal strong.
},
{
    325.22,328.46
     So like this, instead of like a cobweb.
},
{
    328.46,330.12
     Right, we don't, that's kinda,
},
{
    330.12,331.34
     we've got some other things to do,
},
{
    331.34,333.7
     but it is definitely a nice technique that this helps.
},
{
    333.7,335.62
     So you're gonna go across like this
},
{
    335.62,337.8
     and you can do this for a good five minutes
},
{
    337.8,338.94
     if you can tolerate it,
},
{
    338.94,340.78
     and you can do this every day if you like.
},
{
    340.78,342.14
     Right, if you can tolerate it.
},
{
    342.14,343.54
     You'll know if it's the right technique
},
{
    343.54,345.0
     because when you start it'll be a little painful
},
{
    345.0,348.68
     But within 30 seconds to a minute the pain should start decreasing
},
{
    348.68,353.44
     It might be very painful to start off with Brad and but yeah, it should level off at least
},
{
    353.68,357.6
     If it's getting worse and worse and worse as you do this it may be too soon
},
{
    357.6,362.62
     Right, you may have to ice first. Give it a little rest for a day or two and put the cold packs back on. Yeah
},
{
    362.64,366.8
     All right, what we're gonna do right now Brad is, is, so this is a great one to do.
},
{
    366.8,368.16
     I really want you to focus on this one.
},
{
    368.16,370.24
     It's probably one of the ones that'll be most helpful.
},
{
    370.24,372.24
     But we're also gonna show you some other techniques
},
{
    372.24,376.12
     that are maybe more for those stubborn types of,
},
{
    376.12,379.12
     of tennis elbow that don't go away.
},
{
    379.12,380.92
     Because quite often what we'll see
},
{
    380.92,382.52
     in people who have tennis elbow
},
{
    382.52,384.32
     is that that particular elbow
},
{
    384.32,387.32
     doesn't straighten as much as the other elbow. Now sometimes you can
},
{
    387.32,391.08
     compare the two and you'll see it's just slightly bent and then these techniques
},
{
    391.08,394.16
     work out really well for this. So we're going to show the first one up. So if you
},
{
    394.16,397.96
     find a doorway I'm going to simulate this that this is a doorway here you
},
{
    397.96,401.68
     know I'm inside the doorway. What you're going to do is you're actually trying to
},
{
    401.68,407.32
     move this lower forearm that way while this is supported
},
{
    407.32,408.32
     by the doorway.
},
{
    408.32,409.32
     Sure.
},
{
    409.32,411.4
     So it's a little mobilization we're calling it.
},
{
    411.4,413.48
     So I don't know if you can see it in the camera.
},
{
    413.48,414.64
     Here's the corner.
},
{
    414.64,417.92
     You can, you know, it's just a molding of a door, a door jam perhaps.
},
{
    417.92,420.84
     So keep your thumb up, okay.
},
{
    420.84,428.88
     And while the thumb is up, I'm taking, you know, right here here in the between the thumb and the first finger here and I'm pushing, pushing.
},
{
    428.88,433.16
     And while I'm pushing, I'm pushing continuously. I'm going to go ahead and squeeze my hand like this.
},
{
    434.28,437.64
     And while you're doing this, it should feel better.
},
{
    437.64,442.68
     Right. No pain with this. This, what you can do first, Brad, is do it this way and that hurts.
},
{
    442.92,443.24
     Yep.
},
{
    443.24,445.44
     Okay. You might even squeeze a washcloth. Sure. Then you do it this way and that hurts. Okay, you might even squeeze a washcloth.
},
{
    445.44,451.3
     Sure. Then you do it this way and squeeze and it should feel better. If it does, you
},
{
    451.3,455.88
     know you're doing the right thing. This is a good technique if it does. You're doing
},
{
    455.88,460.52
     the right thing. You can even do it at different bends, Brad. You can do it straight and do
},
{
    460.52,466.8
     it a different way. I had a golfer that she was a semi pro golfer. Okay, and this actually is what took her
},
{
    466.8,471.56
     technique work for her. Yep. Good. We'll go back. All right going back to some of the other techniques now
},
{
    471.56,474.64
     These are different techniques for you to try and see which ones work for you
},
{
    474.64,478.76
     Right again if the elbow is not straightening all the way one technique very simple technique
},
{
    478.76,483.32
     They do is actually just to have you turn your arm this way and you just let it drop
},
{
    483.64,489.28
     Sure, and you do that ten times and you're doing kind of a little self-mobilization on the elbow.
},
{
    489.28,493.84
     And you know you're doing the right thing as each time you do it, it feels a little bit
},
{
    493.84,494.84
     better.
},
{
    494.84,495.84
     Yeah, exactly.
},
{
    495.84,499.48
     If by some reason it feels worse each time then you'll stop.
},
{
    499.48,503.96
     The one I liked, the one when I get a little bit of pain Brad, I actually just take my
},
{
    503.96,508.36
     arm and I turn it this way, the hand is facing me and then I go this way
},
{
    508.36,515.66
     I turn it even a little farther and bend it so he's rotating it this way the palm away in this situation ten times I
},
{
    516.24,518.28
     Did want to bring up something about this one
},
{
    518.28,523.02
     I know with patients I've had and my own experiences when you get out of bed this
},
{
    523.64,527.92
     Really painful obviously you're not going to do this one early in the morning you got to be up
},
{
    527.92,532.36
     you might try this one that might that might be work and you can also go the
},
{
    532.36,536.0
     other direction where you turn the palm away from you and turn it this way and
},
{
    536.0,541.52
     again I'm twisting it and bending it at the same time and again if one of these
},
{
    541.52,544.96
     directions feels better with repetition that's when you're going to stick with
},
{
    544.96,546.84
     because usually one will and one will probably...
},
{
    546.84,551.0
     This is the one that worked for me. I like this one. I would do it both directions actually.
},
{
    551.0,552.8
     Both ways are okay. Good.
},
{
    552.8,558.56
     It worked out for me. Another one to do Brad, this one might be easier than the one we just showed up against the wall.
},
{
    558.92,563.6
     You're going to put your arm down. Your fingers are pointed toward you like this.
},
{
    564.12,566.08
     The elbow is straight as you can. Tie
},
{
    566.08,571.92
     out of the way and now again I'm doing the same thing. I'm pushing that way. Yeah let's give
},
{
    571.92,582.8
     them a different view here. Force is that direction. So pressure on, pressure off. Okay. Pressure on,
},
{
    582.8,586.0
     pressure off. About ten times typically. Pressure off. Yep, ten Okay. Pressure on, pressure off. About 10 times typically?
},
{
    586.0,587.0
     Pressure on, pressure off.
},
{
    587.0,588.0
     Yep, 10 times.
},
{
    588.0,590.0
     Again, we're looking for positive results.
},
{
    590.0,590.5
     Right.
},
{
    590.5,591.5
     As you do better.
},
{
    591.5,593.5
     Yep, feels better as you do more.
},
{
    593.5,595.5
     Finally, when the pain is better,
},
{
    595.5,597.5
     you want to do some strengthening, Brad.
},
{
    597.5,598.0
     Sure.
},
{
    598.0,599.0
     Show the eccentric strength.
},
{
    599.0,602.0
     You bet.
},
{
    602.0,605.12
     I like to use stretch band or tubing like this.
},
{
    605.12,607.3
     You can use like a dumbbell.
},
{
    607.3,610.08
     I just think this is easier to vary the resistance.
},
{
    610.08,611.82
     You're going to go down like this.
},
{
    611.82,613.58
     Take the other hand, you're going to help it up.
},
{
    613.58,616.52
     This is when you're starting and then you're going to let it down slow.
},
{
    616.52,622.84
     It's called eccentric or negatives, which is a really good way to strengthen a muscle.
},
{
    622.84,625.58
     And as it gets better, you you know maybe you can go into
},
{
    625.58,630.26
     the typical concentric but initially the eccentric really does help healing
},
{
    630.26,634.22
     more. This is really gets directly to that I can feel these muscles
},
{
    634.22,638.98
     starting to burn already just after it looks easy but it's not exactly.
},
{
    638.98,642.86
