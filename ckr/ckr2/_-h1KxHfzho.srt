     Bob and Brad the two most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    10.32,15.2
     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist, Brad Heineck physical therapist, we are the most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    15.2,20.48
     In our opinion of course Bob, we did one on this earlier as far as regarding the upper extremities
},
{
    20.48,25.16
     But just today we're gonna go how to tell what is causing numbness in your feet or legs
},
{
    25.76,31.82
     Common causes right so yeah, and there we've got about half a dozen things that could possibly
},
{
    31.92,37.6
     We got at least seven. Well actually we got bonus. We got eight. Oh, I know you don't like that number eight
},
{
    37.76,43.56
     Well seven Liz likes even numbers so she likes the eight. Well, okay, so carry on
},
{
    43.56,45.28
     All right, so by the way if you're
},
{
    45.28,49.44
     new to our channel please take a second to subscribe to us we provide videos how stay healthy fit
},
{
    49.44,53.92
     pain-free and we upload every day also go over to the Facebook and like us because Brad and I as
},
{
    53.92,58.88
     children we're not liked so we're trying to turn things around it's Bob and Brad. Bob and Brad. You
},
{
    58.88,64.0
     can find us just look. Alright the first thing we're going to talk about this is just these are
},
{
    64.0,67.06
     some common ones that happen to people sometimes it's happened to me
},
{
    68.04,72.32
     Not necessarily this first one, but especially women if they cross their legs like this
},
{
    72.32,78.24
     Sure, they're putting pressure right on a nerve right here as it goes over the fibula just below the knee
},
{
    78.24,83.68
     Yep, just below the knee and you can actually that can cause numbness especially if you do it, you know
},
{
    83.7,84.26
     You can actually that can cause numbness especially if you do it, you know
},
{
    87.94,88.58
     repetitively day after day, so it's the perineal nerve and
},
{
    94.18,98.86
     So in order to you know if you start getting tingling down the side of your calf you're like, what's causing that? It may be as simple as that it may be just pressure on the nerve when you cross the leg
},
{
    98.86,104.78
     So just don't cross your legs anymore. I've seen some bony people that even laying you know like if they sleep on a hard surface
},
{
    105.04,108.08
     I've seen some bony people that even laying like if they sleep on a hard surface
},
{
    113.76,113.84
     The other one is if you take a big thick wallet like Brad has it's full of money. I don't even have it with me
},
{
    115.84,116.72
     Give it to my wife
},
{
    119.92,128.08
     She's going shopping. There's the old joke about a wallet You hear that my wife's wallet was stolen, but we figured it was cheaper for the thief to have it than to have it
},
{
    128.08,131.72
     So we all hope our wives aren't watching, but anyway, they never watch
},
{
    131.72,136.48
     So you put a thick wallet in your back pocket you can get pressure on your sciatic nerve
},
{
    136.48,140.64
     And this happened to me when I was driving one time and my leg started going entirely numb
},
{
    140.64,146.88
     And I couldn't hit the brake, it was terrible, it was scary. I had to switch feet.
},
{
    146.88,151.16
     That's why I put my wall in my front pocket. So that's what I do.
},
{
    151.16,155.08
     I usually put it on the seat next to me or something.
},
{
    155.08,161.2
     Alright moving forward. Okay next thing. So those are very easy things to correct.
},
{
    161.2,165.16
     Now the next one is called Tarsal Tunnel Syndrome and
},
{
    165.16,170.04
     this is you know we have a nerve that travels, Brad's gonna demonstrate here,
},
{
    170.04,175.0
     we have a nerve that the posterior tibial nerve that transfers or travels
},
{
    175.0,180.84
     right down behind the the medial malleolus or what do you guys, the inside ankle bone
},
{
    180.84,183.84
     yeah right there and there's a little tunnel that goes through just like
},
{
    183.84,192.24
     carpal tunnel you know up in the upper extremity you have tarstle tunnel in the foot and this can get worse by if he's got like flat foot and
},
{
    192.48,198.42
     Putting stress on it, if you sprained your ankle, sure either swelling stretched
},
{
    198.42,202.72
     Whatever it's gonna put pressure and you can test it by just tapping right
},
{
    203.24,209.3
     Behold the ankle bone and the heel bone there in the hollow spot and just start tapping there for about 30 seconds
},
{
    209.3,211.5
     And see if you start getting symptoms into the foot
},
{
    212.54,220.02
     Sometimes you'll even see it swollen there. Sure. I mean you can so anything happening Brad? No, I think I'm pretty
},
{
    220.74,222.74
     I'm clear except for my
},
{
    223.3,225.76
     My coloring is coming off from the tunnels
},
{
    225.76,229.7
     Yeah, the tunnels fall off. I'm getting better. All right the next one Brad, very common
},
{
    230.34,237.6
     Expressionalities with diabetes is peripheral neuropathy. Now with peripheral neuropathy peripheral means out to the sides
},
{
    237.96,243.96
     You know central neuropathy would be the central spinal cord. And nerve obviously
},
{
    243.96,244.72
     The core, you have the trunk and nerve obviously
},
{
    248.32,248.44
     Neuro means nerve and Pathy means abnormality
},
{
    253.8,254.52
     So usually your nerves are damaged and they can get better. I mean they can heal
},
{
    259.32,259.6
     Especially depending on the damage, but there's really a lot of different types of neuropathy. There's like a hundred types
},
{
    261.6,261.68
     It's one of those kind of
},
{
    265.28,265.44
     Words that's maybe abused and people don't really understand it
},
{
    266.88,270.48
     And if you just Well, it can affect the motor nerves, it can affect the sensory nerves
},
{
    270.48,275.88
     It can affect the ones that are sending signals up and the ones that are sending signals down so you can get burning
},
{
    276.32,279.34
     A cold sensation anything that involves the nerves
},
{
    280.24,282.76
     You know it can be a shiny looking
},
{
    283.52,287.5
     Usually it's global. It's not just on one side of the foot or the other.
},
{
    287.5,292.0
     I call it stocking distribution, like if you pulled a long stocking up wherever the stocking is.
},
{
    292.0,294.0
     It's probably both sides too, right?
},
{
    294.0,295.0
     Right, oftentimes.
},
{
    295.0,300.5
     So that's going to be a clue and that's obviously something that generally your doctor is going to diagnose.
},
{
    300.5,307.1
     Right, we don't have any stretches or any tricks to get that, except for maybe exercise with circulation
},
{
    307.1,311.92
     If it happens to be related. The more circulation, hopefully the more it would heal. We've done a video on that before
},
{
    311.92,318.92
     Next one is peripheral artery disease. Now instead of the nerves being affected, it's the arteries
},
{
    318.92,324.24
     And generally what you're finding in that is the arteries, they don't have as much blood flowing through them
},
{
    324.24,329.36
     There may be some atherosclerosis, you know's some buildup of fat they're getting plugged up yep they're
},
{
    329.36,333.2
     getting plugged up good way of saying it Brad and there's not as much blood flowing through it so
},
{
    333.2,339.12
     what often you'll see in this case is someone will walk so far and they go oh I'm getting pain in my
},
{
    339.12,346.78
     calves right right and it's kind of a lot of times equal the concern with this is if you have this if there's blockage down there
},
{
    346.78,351.18
     There could be blockage in the heart and there could be blockage up in the brain
},
{
    351.18,354.42
     So you're at risk of a heart attack or a stroke
},
{
    354.54,358.06
     So you definitely want to get that diagnosed to see if that's the case
},
{
    358.06,361.66
     I'm very familiar with that because my father had it here
},
{
    361.66,367.4
     He had it in his heart and his heart was plugged up, he was pretty much plugged up head to toe
},
{
    367.4,369.4
     His last few years
},
{
    369.56,377.08
     So after he had walked a few blocks he would say everything would be painful and he thought it was an arch problem
},
{
    377.08,382.36
     He was convinced his arches and his shoes weren't any good. I'm sure it was his blood flow issues
},
{
    382.36,388.96
     Exactly very common. I've seen it when I worked with people of amputations because of the they lost the lumbar
},
{
    388.96,392.3
     Right, so all right next one is a herniated disc
},
{
    392.3,397.12
     So you get a lot of back problems can send pain and numbness and tingling down into the legs
},
{
    397.28,400.12
     If it's a herniated disc one of the simple tests you can do it
},
{
    400.12,403.92
     So the disc is pressing on a nerve is just have the person lay down and
},
{
    403.94,405.88
     So the disc is pressing on a nerve, it's just have the person lay down and
},
{
    410.0,410.6
     We do it, so let's say he's getting the pain on this side a lot of times it's one-sided
},
{
    414.14,414.88
     Yeah, and you can bring the leg up like this
},
{
    417.4,421.62
     Straight me, yep, and you can put that one down There you go, I'm going like this and then I'll go up to the point where he starts to feel a little bit of pain
},
{
    421.62,429.4
     I'll back off and then I'll push the foot down like this This is called a straight leg raise and we're checking and if this increases
},
{
    429.72,434.6
     Not the stretching pain if it increases your numbness and pain and pain in the back
},
{
    434.6,438.6
     Right pretty good sign you have a herniated disc particularly go up to there
},
{
    438.6,440.52
     Let's see you start to feel some pain there
},
{
    440.52,445.52
     And then you add that dorsiflexion to the ankle movement and that really hurts here
},
{
    446.16,451.2
     not here that's a real positive test. You can even have the person bring their head up too. Yeah and
},
{
    451.2,457.12
     if you do that it really stretches in their spinal cord all the way along there. So just a little
},
{
    457.12,461.52
     helpful hint you need a little help there to do that one if you want to check it. Yeah,
},
{
    461.52,465.32
     try to do that one by yourself. Now Brad can speak to this next one
},
{
    469.3,469.54
     These next two really kind of spinal stenosis and spondylolisthesis
},
{
    471.7,472.24
     Right. In both of these cases
},
{
    475.92,476.6
     You're gonna probably you're gonna begin pain down the leg
},
{
    481.36,488.72
     And in both of these cases it's gonna feel better when you kind of bend forward So they call it shopping cart syndrome like it feels better when you lean on a shopping cart. When you're walking yeah walking
},
{
    488.72,492.6
     typically is uncomfortable but if you lean forward a little bit it feels better.
},
{
    492.6,499.28
     I know myself you know if I squat down like this that feels so good because
},
{
    499.28,503.76
     we're opening up taking the pressure off the nerve. And sitting feels better. It
},
{
    503.76,505.44
     gives you,. These are the
},
{
    505.44,509.24
     people that will say I can walk so far and then I just have to sit. And when
},
{
    509.24,513.96
     you sit down it's immediate relief. It feels better right away. You do that one
},
{
    513.96,517.96
     where you put your foot up on a stool too don't you? Yeah I've been fortunate I've
},
{
    517.96,522.72
     been able to treat mine so it's not near as bad as it was and that's gonna be a
},
{
    522.72,525.88
     case-by-case but I do this and that helps
},
{
    525.88,531.82
     and I think I've got SI issue that compounded with it. Is there anything else you got Brad?
},
{
    531.82,538.0
     Well I'm afraid to go to the doctor and get it out. I'm really impressed with Brad.
},
{
    538.0,541.28
     I've said this before if Brad wasn't a therapist I think you'd actually been
},
{
    541.28,545.42
     disabled. I mean I think you would have probably had surgery already
},
{
    545.42,550.88
     And I think you would have been yeah, who knows instead of just mentally disabled you'd have been right
},
{
    551.32,555.24
     From the neck up we don't want to go there, but from the neck down things are okay
},
{
    555.24,561.92
     So the bonus issue is sometimes they have what is called false sciatica where you actually have the piriformis muscle
},
{
    561.92,566.38
     Yeah, piriformis is a small muscle in your butt, goes across the sciatic nerve
},
{
    566.38,572.76
     Or sometimes the sciatic nerve pierces it, goes right through the muscle. You were born that way
},
{
    572.76,578.62
     Yeah, you're born that way. They call that an anomaly. So generally one way to test it is
},
{
    578.62,584.92
     If you're having pain down the right leg, I usually bring the leg up and pull it over to the opposite shoulder
},
{
    584.92,586.0
     This one goes down right. Yeah, I usually do it down and right leg, I usually bring the leg up and pull it over to the opposite shoulder, this one goes down right
},
{
    586.0,588.88
     Yeah, I usually do it down and right there is where that
},
{
    589.2,594.6
     Pure form is and if you test one side to the other and this one feels really tight
},
{
    594.6,600.16
     Yep, and then I do this one and this one goes much further and feels good. Yeah, it's a possibility
},
{
    600.16,602.16
     There's other signs that we could go over but sure
},
{
    602.68,606.96
     We're gonna try to keep this video simple so we're just want to go over just the basics, right?
},
{
    606.96,610.68
     You know if we went into detail in all these we could be here for about a week. Yeah
},
{
    611.28,613.28
     Exactly and people
},
{
    613.28,615.28
     They were already tuned to sound so
},
{
    615.8,621.14
     All right everybody remember we can fix this about anything except a broken heart. There you go, but we're working on it
},
{
    621.7,None
     Thanks for watching.
},
