     Did you know that over 450,000 people were burned last year requiring medical attention?
},
{
    9.44,12.24
     And 72% of those burns were right at home.
},
{
    12.24,15.8
     So I know when it comes to your family, you want to minimize the pain and suffering.
},
{
    15.8,18.94
     And of course, you want things to get better, not worse.
},
{
    18.94,22.32
     So stay tuned to learn what to do as well as what not to do.
},
{
    22.32,25.0
     And today's topic, how to treat a burn.
},
{
    25.0,31.8
     Hi, I'm Captain Wayne Bennett here with another first aid tip from my one and done series.
},
{
    31.8,36.4
     Since burns affect the largest organ on the body, the skin, immediate action must be taken
},
{
    36.4,37.88
     to minimize the damage.
},
{
    37.88,42.4
     And keep in mind the two biggest risks when treating burns are infections and hypothermia
},
{
    42.4,43.4
     shock.
},
{
    43.4,47.98
     So for small burns, we will use water. On a a child that would be a burn smaller than the size of their
},
{
    47.98,52.16
     hand. For an adult that would be a burn smaller than the size of their two hands.
},
{
    52.16,56.56
     Water is safe to use on these size burns because it won't cause hypothermia shock.
},
{
    56.56,60.76
     So cool with water for at least 10 minutes to remove the heat and stop the
},
{
    60.76,69.68
     burn progression. Never use ice because this will add frostbite to already burned skin. Never use greasy items like butter or vaseline because that will
},
{
    69.68,75.08
     only trap in the heat and cause even more damage. To treat larger burns with blistering
},
{
    75.08,79.6
     or worse, we're going to put on some vinyl gloves and grab some dry sterile dressings.
},
{
    79.6,83.78
     Yes, the dressing could stick to the burn, but the biggest concern here is an infection
},
{
    83.78,87.64
     and preventing hypothermia, shock from cooling the body too quickly with water.
},
{
    87.64,91.82
     So a great solution to solve all the problems posed by burns is a product we use in the
},
{
    91.82,94.88
     fire department called Burn Free Burn Gel.
},
{
    94.88,97.48
     One of the best things in the world is a burn free gel dressing.
},
{
    97.48,99.4
     This is what we use in the fire service.
},
{
    99.4,106.16
     This is a great tool, soaking wet, cover the wound, and then just simply wrapping gauze.
},
{
    106.16,107.88
     And where can you find something like this?
},
{
    107.88,109.24
     You can find these on our website.
},
{
    109.24,112.16
     You can obviously find it on the internet, but it's not one of those things you're going
},
{
    112.16,116.56
     to find at a grocery store or at a regular pharmacy because it's pretty much a specialized
},
{
    116.56,117.56
     product.
},
{
    117.56,122.72
     Now we have your information on our website, myfoxla.com, but you're just in case people
},
{
    122.72,125.0
     want to know, it's disastersurvivalskills.com.
},
{
    125.0,129.0
     And then you need to get to a doctor right away.
},
{
    129.0,139.0
     You still need to go to a doctor because you always want to have a look at it, but the great thing about this dressing is it doesn't stick, stops a burning, stops a pain, kills any infection.
},
{
    139.0,148.2
     It's the best way to go. But again, if you don't have that handy, of course, always cool water, but at a minimum of 10 minutes in the water. And of course, don't let your family or the internet
},
{
    148.2,153.6
     talk you into those home remedies like mustard, mayonnaise, egg whites, butter, and even toothpaste.
},
{
    153.6,157.72
     Again, these things will only trap in the heat, allowing the skin to keep burning, or
},
{
    157.72,162.88
     put you at risk of infection, or both. Also remember on large, serious burns requiring
},
{
    162.88,166.68
     medical attention, anything you've rubbed in has to be scrubbed out.
