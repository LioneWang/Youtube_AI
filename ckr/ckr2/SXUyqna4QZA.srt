     This video addresses what is sinus congestion, the benefits of sinus rinsing, and how to
},
{
    53.08,55.8
     do sinus rinsing at home.
},
{
    55.8,62.76
     The sinuses are air-filled spaces in the cheekbones, between the eyes, and in the forehead.
},
{
    62.76,66.36
     Normally, the sinuses are moist or wet inside
},
{
    66.36,68.88
     with a thin layer of mucus.
},
{
    68.88,73.72
     Normal, healthy sinuses have fine hairs or cilia inside
},
{
    73.72,75.52
     to clear the mucus.
},
{
    75.52,78.08
     It drains away on its own.
},
{
    78.08,81.0
     When your sinuses aren't working as they should,
},
{
    81.0,82.84
     the mucus builds up.
},
{
    82.84,84.92
     This is called congestion.
},
{
    84.92,88.6
     Congestion usually means that the lining of the sinuses
},
{
    88.6,89.88
     is swollen.
},
{
    89.88,94.36
     You may have thick, colored, mucus drainage, bad breath,
},
{
    94.36,99.96
     fever, facial pressure, or pain, a cough, stuffy nose,
},
{
    99.96,102.72
     or all of these symptoms.
},
{
    102.72,107.18
     Rinsing the inside of your nose with a mild saltwater solution
},
{
    107.18,109.64
     helps to reduce the swelling.
},
{
    109.64,112.94
     This in turn often reduces congestion
},
{
    112.94,115.5
     to help you breathe more easily.
},
{
    115.5,119.1
     Rinsing also moves mucus, dirt, and dust

    119.1,121.72
     out of your nose and sinuses.

    121.72,123.64
     Rinsing the inside of the nose

{
    135.86,145.0
     is a proactive step you can take to help relieve sinus symptoms and congestion. Here are the steps to do sinus rinsing.
},
{
    151.0,160.0
     Step one, gather your supplies. You will need a sinus rinsing device and materials to make a mild saltwater solution.
},
{
    160.0,167.0
     This is also known as saline solution. There are different devices to use for sinus rinsing.
},
{
    167.0,170.0
     The most common are a sinus rinse bottle.
},
{
    170.0,174.0
     As you squeeze the bottle, the saline squirts out the top.
},
{
    174.0,178.0
     Or a neti pot, which looks like a small teapot.
},
{
    178.0,183.0
     You can get a sinus rinse bottle or neti pot at your local drugstore
},
{
    183.0,187.0
     or a store that carries home healthcare supplies.
},
{
    187.0,194.0
     A bulb syringe should not be used for sinus rinsing unless your healthcare provider tells you to use one.
},
{
    194.0,199.0
     Saline solution is the most common fluid to use for sinus rinsing.
},
{
    199.0,204.0
     Saline is a mixture of salt, baking soda and very clean water.
},
{
    204.0,205.12
     Distilled water is the best option. Galene is a mixture of salt, baking soda, and very clean water.
},
{
    205.12,208.16
     Distilled water is the best option.
},
{
    208.16,214.08
     No matter where you live, tap water or well water are not completely clean or pure for
},
{
    214.08,216.8
     purposes of sinus rinsing.
},
{
    216.8,220.96
     You don't want germs in the water to go into your nose.
},
{
    220.96,225.0
     If you must use tap water, boil it for three minutes and then cool.
},
{
    225.0,230.0
     Use water that is warm or body temperature. It is more comfortable.
},
{
    230.0,236.0
     You can warm the water in a microwave. Don't use hot water.
},
{
    236.0,243.0
     For the saline ingredients, you can buy pre-measured packets of saline powder over the counter.
},
{
    243.0,246.4
     You can also make it yourself. If you make
},
{
    246.4,253.44
     saline at home, start with 1-1.5 teaspoon of salt and 1-1.25 teaspoon of baking soda
},
{
    253.44,262.08
     in 8 ounces of distilled water. Use non-iodized sea salt or kosher salt and not table salt.
},
{
    262.08,265.9
     The non-iodized salt will be more comfortable.
},
{
    265.9,269.34
     Adjust the amount of salt to your comfort.
},
{
    269.34,274.04
     Step two, wash your hands very well with soap and water.
},
{
    274.04,277.66
     Rinse and dry your hands on a clean towel.
},
{
    277.66,281.9
     Step three, prepare the saline solution.
},
{
    281.9,286.72
     Fill the sinus rinse bottle with the warm distilled water. Add the
},
{
    286.72,293.88
     saline powder to the bottle. Screw on the nozzle. Gently shake the bottle to mix
},
{
    293.88,300.76
     the solution. For a neti pot stir the saline powder into the water and mix
},
{
    300.76,306.88
     gently. If you are measuring your own salt and baking soda to make saline,
},
{
    306.88,315.08
     add both to the bottle or neti pot and mix gently. Step 4. Start rinsing.
},
{
    315.08,325.0
     Lean your upper body over a sink. You may prefer to keep your face upright as if you are looking into a mirror.
},
{
    325.0,330.0
     Or you may want to tip your head toward the faucet.
},
{
    330.0,334.0
     Put the tip of the bottle firmly into one of your nostrils.
},
{
    334.0,338.0
     You want to block the entire nostril.
},
{
    338.0,344.0
     Gently squeeze the bottle until the solution runs out of your other nostril or your mouth.
},
{
    344.0,349.0
     Before you release each squeeze, remove the bottle from your nose.
},
{
    349.0,355.0
     You don't want to pull solution that was in your nose back into the bottle.
},
{
    355.0,359.0
     Use about half the bottle for each nostril.
},
{
    359.0,367.0
     If you are having trouble, try putting your head in different positions to see what works for you.
},
{
    367.0,371.0
     For a neti pot, follow the same steps.
},
{
    371.0,373.0
     Tip your head to the side.
},
{
    373.0,378.0
     Put the tip of the neti pot firmly into one nostril.
},
{
    378.0,384.0
     Pour the saline into the nostril so it runs out of your other nostril or your mouth.
},
{
    384.0,387.92
     Do one side and then the other.
},
{
    387.92,389.76
     Step 5.
},
{
    389.76,394.64
     After rinsing, tilt your head to the side and blow your nose.
},
{
    394.64,397.6
     Some saline may drain down your throat.
},
{
    397.6,403.16
     The small amount you swallow is not a problem for most people.
},
{
    403.16,404.72
     Step 6.
},
{
    404.72,406.16
     Clean the bottle.
},
{
    406.16,411.96
     When you have finished rinsing, wash the bottle or neti pot with hot but not boiling water
},
{
    411.96,415.08
     and a small amount of dishwashing soap.
},
{
    415.08,416.68
     Rinse and drain well.
},
{
    416.68,419.04
     Allow to air dry.
},
{
    419.04,422.92
     Wash your hands and dry on a clean towel.
},
{
    422.92,425.8
     Replace the bottle every three months.
},
{
    425.8,427.88
     As you start with sinus rinsing,
},
{
    427.88,430.52
     you may have to try different saline powders
},
{
    430.52,433.36
     to see which one works best for you.
},
{
    433.36,434.78
     And don't give up.
},
{
    434.78,437.92
     Sinus rinsing may seem hard at first,
},
{
    437.92,441.04
     but it is an important part of your self-care,
},
{
    441.04,444.04
     and it makes a difference for many people.
