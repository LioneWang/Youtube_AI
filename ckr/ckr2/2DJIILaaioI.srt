     In this video, I'm going to show you how to get rid of meniscus pain quickly using an everyday bath towel.
},
{
    6.0,7.0
     Stay tuned.
},
{
    12.0,16.0
     Hey everyone, Dr. O here at SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan.
},
{
    16.0,31.14
     So this is going to be a traction exercise that's going to help meniscal tears, meniscus injuries, or just general knee pain. If you're unfamiliar with what the meniscus is, it's a padding or cushion in between
},
{
    31.14,32.9
     the bones that make up the knee.
},
{
    32.9,36.94
     You can get a lot of compression in there causing a lot of knee pain.
},
{
    36.94,42.7
     So what we're going to focus on is tractioning or pulling that knee joint open to help relieve
},
{
    42.7,46.68
     pressure and tension and hopefully get you a lot of pain relief.
},
{
    46.68,49.18
     Again, all you need is a simple bath towel,
},
{
    49.18,50.68
     so let's get started with it.
},
{
    50.68,52.62
     So I'm going to show this in two parts.
},
{
    52.62,54.68
     With the first part, take the towel,
},
{
    54.68,57.62
     roll it up like this and place it underneath the knee
},
{
    57.62,60.24
     that you're looking to traction.
},
{
    60.24,62.6
     What we want to do is grab the part of the leg
},
{
    62.6,66.02
     below the knee and then squeeze that down into the
},
{
    66.02,67.02
     towel.
},
{
    67.02,71.06
     So what I'm doing is clamping down on that towel as far as I feel comfortable.
},
{
    71.06,74.5
     And if you start to feel any pain with this, discontinue immediately.
},
{
    74.5,78.5
     What you want to do is just hold that for about 15 seconds.
},
{
    78.5,82.1
     You're going to release and then you're just going to keep doing it.
},
{
    82.1,85.36
     What this does is it opens up a wedge into the knee
},
{
    85.36,89.52
     to help relieve tension and pressure off that meniscus.
},
{
    89.52,90.76
     So give it a try.
},
{
    90.76,92.4
     So let's move on to the second part.
},
{
    92.4,95.04
     So for the second part, I'm going to be on both knees
},
{
    95.04,96.6
     and I'm going to roll the towel up
},
{
    96.6,98.92
     so it's in its full length.
},
{
    98.92,100.72
     I'm going to grab the two ends
},
{
    100.72,102.64
     and I'm going to wrap the towel
},
{
    102.64,105.0
     at the back of the knee of the one that I want to traction.
},
{
    105.0,113.0
     Pull that as tight as you can. Go forward with it until it feels like there's no slack between the towel and the back of the leg.
},
{
    113.0,118.0
     You want as much tension built up as possible. So this is pretty straightforward.
},
{
    118.0,130.92
     What you're going to do is anchor those two straps of the towels down, and then you're going to lower your butt towards your ankles very very slowly and when you do this you might feel a release
},
{
    130.92,134.82
     into the knee like a pop or a crack that is completely normal it's just the
},
{
    134.82,140.86
     traction opening up those joints so you want to keep slowly lowering down until
},
{
    140.86,146.16
     it feels like your butt touches the back of your heel. So again what I'm
},
{
    146.16,152.96
     doing is I'm taking my butt slowly towards my heel and when you do this you
},
{
    152.96,158.48
     should concentrate on making sure that you are in good alignment. How you can
},
{
    158.48,161.9
     tell that if you feel your butt bone right here that's kind of like the sit
},
{
    161.9,167.16
     bone when you come down that should be directly over the heel right here, that's kind of like the sit bone, when you come down, that should be directly over the heel right here.
},
{
    167.16,169.2
     So the heel should be over that butt bone.
},
{
    169.2,172.24
     That means that it's in a straight line while you're doing the traction.
},
{
    172.24,176.32
     And if it feels like you're just not able to get your butt bone down to your heel, that's
},
{
    176.32,178.04
     no big problem.
},
{
    178.04,182.16
     Just go as far as you feel comfortable and work into it.
},
{
    182.16,185.54
     But once you get to a spot where there's a lot of traction or
},
{
    185.54,191.42
     your butt bone touches your heel, hold that for about 15 to 30 seconds. Relax and
},
{
    191.42,196.92
     then do three to five repetitions. Again, if you feel any discomfort or pain
},
{
    196.92,201.86
     while doing this, discontinue immediately. But it's going to help open a wedge into
},
{
    201.86,209.12
     your knee, relieve pressure off that meniscus, and hopefully get you a lot of pain relief into the knee. Give it a try.
