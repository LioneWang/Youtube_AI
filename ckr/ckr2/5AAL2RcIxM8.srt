},
{
    15.6,16.44

    16.44,17.84
     In our opinion, of course, Bob.
},
{
    17.84,19.82
     Today we're gonna talk about how to stop neck
},
{
    19.82,22.32
     and back pain at your desk,
},
{
    22.32,24.96
     plus getting perfect posture at the same time.
},
{
    24.96,25.42
     Right. And not only at your desk, plus getting perfect posture at the same time.
},
{
    25.42,28.82
     And not only at your desk, but as it kind of carries on
},
{
    28.82,30.22
     for the rest of your life.
},
{
    30.22,31.38
     And the rest of your day.

},
{
    51.04,52.0

},
{
    52.0,54.12
     Yeah, and we're actually gonna use it today
},
{
    54.12,55.32
     in one of our exercises.
},
{
    55.32,56.16
     Yes.

},
{
    65.04,66.2
     There you go, say no more.
},
{
    66.2,67.8
     How can your day go wrong when you get that?
},
{
    67.8,69.16
     Exactly, Bob.
},
{
    69.16,70.0
     Okay.
},
{
    70.0,74.92
     All right, so Bob, so many of us work at a desk for a living
},
{
    74.92,77.68
     or a good part of the day or sit in the car,
},
{
    77.68,79.68
     all these seated pastures.
},
{
    79.68,81.32
     Even just sit and watch TV.
},
{
    81.32,82.44
     Right, right.
},
{
    82.44,86.0
     And I believe, you know, it affects your posture.
},
{
    86.0,86.84
     Your posture.
},
{
    86.84,87.84
     It absolutely does.
},
{
    87.84,89.8
     It affects your neck, your shoulder, your back,
},
{
    89.8,91.8
     creating pain.
},
{
    91.8,92.64
     Yeah.
},
{
    92.64,94.88
     Pain that seemingly comes from nowhere,
},
{
    94.88,98.32
     but it's there and it's real and how to reverse it.
},
{
    98.32,101.28
     So actually, a good friend of mine,
},
{
    101.28,103.8
     is in this situation, just retired,
},
{
    103.8,106.48
     working at a desk for the good part of her life
},
{
    106.48,108.84
     and she's concerned about her posture
},
{
    108.84,110.92
     as well as some of these aches and pains.
},
{
    110.92,112.48
     So this is for Eugene.
},
{
    112.48,113.32
     We're gonna-
},
{
    113.32,114.64
     I was gonna say, did you back out on saying her name?
},
{
    114.64,115.48
     I thought originally-
},
{
    115.48,117.16
     Yeah, no, I'm gonna say her name.
},
{
    117.16,118.24
     She gets upset with me.
},
{
    118.24,119.72
     That's the way it's gonna be.
},
{
    119.72,121.68
     I think we're all surprised that Brad has a friend.
},
{
    121.68,124.36
     Well, you know, it happens.
},
{
    124.36,125.26
     It happens.
},
{
    125.26,130.16
     So what we need to do is, first of all, look at posture
},
{
    130.16,131.84
     and we're gonna start from the-
},
{
    131.84,134.2
     So this is a daily routine that she can do.
},
{
    134.2,136.34
     Yep, and you know, I already saw her,
},
{
    136.34,137.84
     we worked her a third and I said,
},
{
    137.84,140.56
     I'm gonna make a video for you so you can see these exercises
},
{
    140.56,142.0
     instead of my scribbling on the paper.
},
{
    142.0,142.84
     Gotcha.
},
{
    142.84,144.48
     Because I didn't draw any pictures.
},
{
    144.48,146.5
     This always works better anyways.
},
{
    146.5,150.28
     So yeah, we're gonna do these two to three times per day.
},
{
    150.28,151.8
     Although we're gonna talk about some of them
},
{
    151.8,153.04
     that might be too aggressive
},
{
    153.04,154.96
     and you may only wanna start one time a day
},
{
    154.96,156.6
     and build up two or three times a day.
},
{
    156.6,157.92
     And I would say some of the other ones
},
{
    157.92,159.44
     you could do more than two or three times a day.
},
{
    159.44,160.28
     Exactly.
},
{
    160.28,162.68
     So it's gonna be, depending on your situation
},
{
    162.68,163.52
     and how they feel.
},
{
    163.52,164.84
     So we're starting to babble now, Bob.
},
{
    164.84,166.48
     No, we're okay. Let's get the first one. So we're starting to babble now, Bob. Now, okay, let's get the first one.
},
{
    166.48,168.52
     So we're gonna start from the neck and work down.
},
{
    168.52,169.36
     Sure.
},
{
    169.36,172.08
     Okay, so, you can, these are best,
},
{
    172.08,173.04
     you can do these standing,
},
{
    173.04,174.56
     but they're best done in a chair.
},
{
    174.56,177.44
     And you know, how many times do we have to go over
},
{
    177.44,178.28
     the chin tuck?
},
{
    178.28,179.12
     Right.
},
{
    179.12,179.94
     And we're gonna continue to do it
},
{
    179.94,181.16
     for another 20 years.
},
{
    181.16,183.64
     That's right, until you're sick of them, to the point.
},
{
    183.64,187.52
     Get yourself in a good posture and do the chin tuck like this.
},
{
    187.52,189.76
     It stretches those muscles back here and there.
},
{
    189.76,192.08
     So those of you who are new to our channel,
},
{
    192.08,195.08
     your posture is quite often one of the problems
},
{
    195.08,196.84
     is the forward head posture.
},
{
    196.84,199.76
     And that not only corrects it and stretches it,
},
{
    199.76,201.2
     but it's a reminder.
},
{
    201.2,203.4
     You'll be working at the desk and all of a sudden you go,
},
{
    203.4,204.92
     oh, I need to do some chin tucks.
},
{
    204.92,207.44
     And you'll find out, yeah, my head was forward.
},
{
    207.44,211.56
     So it's like, and remember, you're going straight back.
},
{
    211.56,213.28
     You're not going up, you're not going down.
},
{
    213.28,214.76
     You're just going straight back.
},
{
    214.76,217.4
     And I like to give a little over pressure sometimes.
},
{
    217.4,219.56
     Especially if I'm getting a little pain back here,
},
{
    219.56,222.48
     or neck headaches.
},
{
    222.48,225.0
     I like to go ahead and do a little over pressure.
},
{
    225.36,227.08
     Pretty much we beat it to death.
},
{
    227.08,227.92
     Beat that to death.
},
{
    227.92,230.16
     All right, do that five to 10 repetitions.
},
{
    230.16,232.28
     I'm gonna go over to the shoulders
},
{
    232.28,233.8
     and there's a few options for this.
},
{
    233.8,235.38
     So it's nice in a chair.
},
{
    235.38,237.2
     Now this is where Jean we were talking,
},
{
    237.2,238.96
     I didn't have a chair like this,
},
{
    238.96,240.96
     but a nice office chair, I think you have one.
},
{
    240.96,244.6
     And you can do the W stretch like this is one
},
{
    244.6,246.6
     and pressure on, pressure on. Remember, you have one. And you can do the W stretch like this is one. And pressure on, pressure on.
},
{
    246.6,248.84
     Remember, you have to breathe and relax
},
{
    248.84,251.6
     with all these five to 10 of these.
},
{
    251.6,252.84
     Okay.
},
{
    252.84,253.92
     Now the other thing you can do,
},
{
    253.92,255.24
     just we show the ball one.
},
{
    255.24,257.0
     This is a bonus.
},
{
    257.0,258.08
     This is a bonus one.
},
{
    258.08,260.76
     If you happen to have a squishy ball around this one,
},
{
    260.76,262.72
     it just feels a little bit better
},
{
    262.72,264.6
     when you get it right between your shoulder blades
},
{
    264.6,267.14
     and move it up and down as you want
},
{
    267.14,269.9
     and you get a little more exaggeration.
},
{
    269.9,272.18
     It's nice about it, you can hit the exact area
},
{
    272.18,273.02
     that you want to.
},
{
    273.02,276.42
     We gotta give kudos to our cameraman.
},
{
    276.42,277.58
     Mike came up with it.
},
{
    277.58,278.66
     He's exactly right.
},
{
    278.66,280.46
     We'll have to call it the, I don't know,
},
{
    280.46,283.26
     Mike ball or whatever, what do you want, Mike?
},
{
    283.26,284.34
     I don't know.
},
{
    284.34,285.92
     All right, next one.
},
{
    285.92,288.44
     Now, this is a real nice one, and this one,
},
{
    289.88,291.08
     really good for neck pain.
},
{
    291.08,294.76
     Yeah, and if you have that neck pain that radiates down
},
{
    294.76,298.04
     into the shoulders, get a towel roll.
},
{
    298.04,299.44
     You can do it with auto towel roll,
},
{
    299.44,302.0
     but a lot of people find starting out with a towel roll
},
{
    302.0,302.96
     really is more comfortable.
},
{
    302.96,306.88
     Look at these glasses off, my gosh. Better put them up on the cupboard
},
{
    306.88,308.84
     I'll sit on them otherwise.
},
{
    308.84,313.84
     Down low on the neck, shoulders back, breathe,
},
{
    313.84,317.72
     and just let your neck go back and stretch.
},
{
    317.72,318.56
     Can you hear me?
},
{
    318.56,321.08
     My guess is kind of messing with my microphone.
},
{
    321.08,321.92
     There you go.
},
{
    321.92,323.6
     You know, if you want to go up like this,
},
{
    323.6,325.32
     that can feel better too.
},
{
    325.32,327.0
     But you're not gonna go back and hold it
},
{
    327.0,328.36
     for five or 10 seconds.
},
{
    328.36,332.04
     All you need to do is go back and stretch and relax
},
{
    332.04,333.08
     and come forward.
},
{
    333.08,336.92
     If you do get dizzy with this, you're not gonna do it.
},
{
    336.92,338.28
     Jean did have a little issue with that,
},
{
    338.28,339.72
     but it wasn't, it was pretty minor.
},
{
    339.72,342.24
     Don't go as far back for one thing to try it
},
{
    342.24,343.88
     and see if you get less dizzy.
},
{
    343.88,345.8
     You may have a little vertigo that you may have to get
},
{
    345.8,347.48
     taken care of.
},
{
    347.48,349.92
     Next thing we're gonna do is stand up
},
{
    349.92,352.26
     and we are gonna use the Buya Stick for this.
},
{
    352.26,354.96
     You don't have to have a Buya Stick if you just have
},
{
    354.96,358.04
     a stick of some sorts about five feet long
},
{
    358.04,361.0
     and we're gonna go up like this,
},
{
    361.0,363.48
     take a deep breath in and exhale
},
{
    363.48,366.04
     and go down behind your back like this.
},
{
    366.04,368.44
     And there's different ways you can put your arms.
},
{
    368.44,370.28
     There's no definite way to do it,
},
{
    370.28,373.14
     but you're gonna feel a stretch across here
},
{
    373.14,373.98
     in that chest.
},
{
    373.98,375.02
     You're gonna stick your chest out
},
{
    375.02,377.64
     and then arch your back
},
{
    377.64,379.04
     and you can work that.
},
{
    379.04,382.28
     And you go up and you can do like five of these.
},
{
    382.28,384.56
     If it feels good to hold for a little bit longer,
},
{
    384.56,385.68
     feel free to do that. You could do a little rotation these. If it feels good to hold for a little bit longer, feel free to do that.
},
{
    385.68,388.12
     You could do a little rotation if you'd like to.
},
{
    388.12,390.52
     But all this is just working that shoulder.
},
{
    390.52,392.4
     I even like to do shintucks with these.
},
{
    392.4,393.4
     Oh, sure.
},
{
    393.4,394.44
     Do it at the same time.
},
{
    394.44,395.52
     Yeah, it's a double.
},
{
    395.52,396.36
     It's a bonus.
},
{
    396.36,397.84
     And you're working this upper back.
},
{
    397.84,399.56
     Yeah, so.
},
{
    400.52,402.52
     Getting two birds with one booyah.
},
{
    402.52,404.52
     Yeah, and don't forget this one.
},
{
    404.52,405.36
     Oh yeah. Where you put it here. Now this one too,ah. Yeah, and don't forget this one. Oh yeah.
},
{
    405.36,406.2
     Where you put it here.
},
{
    406.2,409.36
     Now this one too, you can go up and down.
},
{
    409.36,412.2
     And this is where it has this nice to have something
},
{
    412.2,414.28
     that's slippery, that's why the booyah stick is nice.
},
{
    414.28,415.56
     It slides on it.
},
{
    415.56,420.48
     Oh, and then also myzoldulul extension for the low back.
},
{
    420.48,422.6
     Like that, there you go.
},
{
    422.6,424.76
     Five to 10 repetitions or if it,
},
{
    424.76,426.4
     these are ones you could do all the time.
},
{
    426.4,429.96
     That one really kind of emphasizes the mid-back,
},
{
    429.96,430.92
     a thoracic area.
},
{
    430.92,432.44
     Right, precisely.
},
{
    432.44,433.28
     You know.
},
{
    433.28,434.4
     This next one is for the low back.
},
{
    434.4,435.88
     Right, so we started at the neck,
},
{
    435.88,437.92
     we did the thoracic, shoulders,
},
{
    437.92,439.64
     and now we're at the low back.
},
{
    439.64,441.0
     I don't wanna hold onto that Brad.
},
{
    441.0,442.18
     Oh, sure.
},
{
    442.18,444.68
     Oh, all right, the low back.
},
{
    444.68,446.92
     And this is something, it sounds like Jean,
},
{
    446.92,449.44
     you may need to go into slowly.
},
{
    449.44,451.36
     If you've ever done these before,
},
{
    451.36,453.52
     what I have found, what you're doing is press ups.
},
{
    453.52,455.32
     You put your hands, but only see your shoulders.
},
{
    455.32,458.28
     And what I find people that are maybe a little older
},
{
    458.28,459.68
     and they haven't done these,
},
{
    459.68,460.84
     is they actually push up like this
},
{
    460.84,462.56
     and their whole body goes up with it.
},
{
    462.56,463.4
     Yeah.
},
{
    463.4,464.24
     Because they're so tight.
},
{
    464.24,465.56
     It's no good. There's no movement.
},
{
    465.56,468.52
     So I just have them do like baby,
},
{
    468.52,470.56
     you call them baby press ups, right?
},
{
    470.56,473.64
     Baby press ups and have them work into it.
},
{
    473.64,476.88
     You might do this, you know, direction for a week or so,
},
{
    476.88,479.36
     you know, just due to the baby ones.
},
{
    479.36,481.8
     And then eventually you want to get up to the point
},
{
    481.8,483.68
     where you get up all the way to the top.
},
{
    483.68,487.54
     But the whole time, remember the pelvis stays on the mat.
},
{
    487.54,489.26
     That's the key point.
},
{
    489.26,491.46
     You may not get this high.
},
{
    491.46,492.7
     You may never get this high.
},
{
    492.7,494.78
     Bob's been doing this for a long time.
},
{
    494.78,496.78
     I've been doing them since I was young.
},
{
    496.78,499.54
     So I maintain.
},
{
    499.54,500.38
     Right.
},
{
    500.38,503.18
     So if you get up to this height even, that's really good.
},
{
    503.18,506.88
     And with these 10, no more than 10 is needed.
},
{
    506.88,508.92
     Five to 10 is good.
},
{
    508.92,510.92
     And if you got shoulder problems
},
{
    510.92,512.92
     and that does irritate your shoulder,
},
{
    512.92,514.96
     then that's an issue.
},
{
    514.96,516.88
     You can't do it.
},
{
    516.88,518.2
     You can do the standing ones possibly.
},
{
    518.2,519.84
     You have to maybe do the standing ones.
},
{
    519.84,520.68
     Exactly.
},
{
    520.68,522.04
     So there's always an option.
},
{
    522.04,524.76
     So for anybody who has these issues,
},
{
    524.76,526.28
     it's gonna help your posture,
},
{
    526.28,528.26
     it's gonna help the pain,
},
{
    528.26,530.22
     and it's gonna change your life
},
{
    530.22,531.06
     is what it's gonna do.
},
{
    531.06,532.26
     Do you think there's anybody else out there
},
{
    532.26,533.9
     willing to be your friend?
},
{
    533.9,536.02
     Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna find one today.
},
{
    536.02,537.4
     All right.
},
{
    537.4,None
     Good luck to you, Brad. you
