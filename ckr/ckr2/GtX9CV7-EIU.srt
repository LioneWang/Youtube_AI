     What is a concentrator?
},
{
    5.56,13.26
     It is a machine that literally squeezes oxygen out of air and provides it to you.
},
{
    13.26,17.3
     Normal concentration of oxygen in room air is 21%.
},
{
    17.3,22.94
     And this is what the concentrator takes out and then provides to you in a relatively pure
},
{
    22.94,30.84
     form of oxygen. Now when we use oxygen outside of a hospital setting at home or as we discussed in a RWA
},
{
    30.84,38.76
     designated area, oxygen can be delivered by nasal cannula or by a mask, face mask.
},
{
    38.76,44.2
     Now typically we would start with the nasal cannula which is a simple tubing and the tubing
},
{
    44.2,46.34
     has two ports which
},
{
    46.34,48.98
     are placed inside your nostril.
},
{
    48.98,55.24
     After placing them in your nostril then on either side the tube hooks around your ears
},
{
    55.24,60.28
     and then they and then you can tighten it so that it is secure.
},
{
    60.28,65.72
     The tube is then connected to the oxygen tube that comes from the oxygen concentrator.
},
{
    65.72,70.68
     So, it attaches to the oxygen concentrator, then you set it to the level required, it
},
{
    70.68,73.08
     can be 2 liters or 3 liters.
},
{
    73.08,76.76
     Alternatively, if it is an oxygen cylinder, it is the same mechanism and you connect it
},
{
    76.76,77.84
     to the oxygen cylinder.
},
{
    77.84,82.84
     While you are doing this, it is important to monitor the with the pulse oximeter what
},
{
    82.84,85.28
     the patients oxygen levels are.
},
{
    85.28,91.32
     So, the oxygen level less than 94 is the indication for oxygen and once you have given the person
},
{
    91.32,95.16
     oxygen we expect it to go above 94 percent.
},
{
    95.16,97.96
     The next question is how do we use an oxygen concentrator?
},
{
    97.96,100.84
     It is a very simple thing to use it works on electricity.
},
{
    100.84,106.64
     So, it has to be connected and it has to be pressed on. Now, humidification
},
{
    106.64,112.72
     which is a common thing we use is provided by filling the bottle with distilled water
},
{
    112.72,118.92
     and connecting it. The tube dips into it and we can see the oxygen bubbling when we set
},
{
    118.92,125.96
     the rate at 1, 2, 3 or 4 liter. Most concentrators give oxygen up to 5 liters per minute, but we do
},
{
    125.96,130.88
     have high flow ones which give up to 10 liters per minute. There is also a device called
},
{
    130.88,137.92
     an oxymizer which can increase this oxygen rate flow rate. It can it concentrates oxygen
},
{
    137.92,142.56
     even further and gives a more pure form of oxygen and this is just one of the devices
},
{
    142.56,145.52
     that can be used with the concentrator.
},
{
    145.52,151.72
     Once the humidifier has been attached then once again the oxygen tube is attached to
},
{
    151.72,157.68
     the humidifier port and that tubing is further connected to the nasal prongs that the patient
},
{
    157.68,158.68
     is using.
},
{
    158.68,166.56
     We set it at the right level, we check the patient's oxygen saturation with the pulse oximeter. So this is the way one can
},
{
    166.56,172.88
     use the setup at home but again the key thing to remember in the circumstance in the situation of
},
{
    172.88,180.24
     COVID-19 infection is that if your levels are low, oxygen level less than 94% or respiratory rate more
},
{
    180.24,185.64
     than 24% or you are a feeling subjective feeling of breathlessness you must seek medical
},
{
    185.64,187.64
     attention immediately.
},
{
    187.64,188.36
     Thank you very much.
