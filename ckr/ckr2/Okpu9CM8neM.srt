     common form of skin cancer.
},
{

     It begins in the basal cells,

     slightly transparent bump

{
    32.06,33.0
     on the skin that won't go

     other forms.
},
{
    35.06,36.0
     It's kind of pink and

     pearly, shiny, has little

     blood vessels that can go

     also a basal cell but it

     like eczema on someone's

     the United States.

     melanoma.
},
{
    134.0,135.0
     It's asymmetrical, so it's not
},
{
    135.0,136.0
     the same on either side. You
},
{
    136.0,137.0
     have border irregularity, or
},
{
    137.0,138.0
     what we call like the coast of
},
{
    138.0,139.0
     Maine. You have color
},
{
    139.0,140.0
     variation, there's some brown,
},
{
    140.0,141.0
     some really dark brown, lighter
},
{
    141.0,142.0
     color, and you have a
},
{
    142.0,143.0
     color variation.
},
{
    143.0,144.0
     And that's what we call the
},
{
    144.0,145.54
     color variation. And that's what we call the color variation. And, or what we call like the coast of Maine.
},
{
    145.54,147.0
     You have color variation.
},
{
    147.0,149.44

    149.44,152.48
     lighter colors, almost a blue-black color.
},
{
    152.48,155.74
     And then diameter, greater than a pencil eraser.
},
{
    155.74,159.82
     And then evolution, so definitely this is probably changed
},
{
    159.82,161.56
     and spread on this individual,
},
{
    161.56,163.6
     and you have another new bump coming up here.
},
{
    163.6,165.0
     There is hope for people diagnosed with melanoma if they're diagnosed early.
},
{
    165.0,165.6
     They're caught early.
},

    165.6,166.0
     We call that melanoma

     in situ.

     And those lesions and
