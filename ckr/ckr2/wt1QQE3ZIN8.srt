     Hi, I'm Dr. Kirsten Muanig and I'm coming to you from River Valley Chiropractic where
},
{
    8.52,11.2
     we teach you to move well so that you can live well.
},
{
    11.2,14.44
     And I wanted to talk a little bit about some neck pain today.
},
{
    14.44,18.8
     I had several patients come in last week and they all have been to have spasm in the same
},
{
    18.8,21.6
     muscle which was the levator scapula muscle.
},
{
    21.6,25.44
     And if you're not familiar with the levator scapula muscle, it actually runs,
},
{
    26.24,30.88
     it attaches up here on the top of your first and second bones in your neck, your first and second
},
{
    30.88,37.68
     vertebra, and then it runs down to the bone in the back of your shoulder, your scapula, and attaches
},
{
    37.68,45.62
     at the superior and inside medial border of the scapula. And the action of the levator scapula muscle
},
{
    45.62,51.34
     is to elevate the scapula and medially retract the scapula. That's the action
},
{
    51.34,55.98
     of the muscle. Now what can cause this muscle to spasm up and hurt? Well one of
},
{
    55.98,60.58
     my patients had been out had been doing back workouts so he had been doing
},
{
    60.58,65.64
     rows and flies. Both of those involve movement of the scapula,
},
{
    65.64,67.32
     especially if there's some imbalance
},
{
    67.32,69.2
     or weakness in some of the back muscles.
},
{
    69.2,70.64
     And as you're doing a row,
},
{
    70.64,73.12
     you find that your shoulders pull up a little bit
},
{
    73.12,75.56
     instead of rowing straight back.
},
{
    75.56,77.24
     But again, even rowing straight back,
},
{
    77.24,79.6
     you're bringing your scapula in
},
{
    79.6,81.66
     and you're getting that movement
},
{
    81.66,83.14
     of that levator scapula muscle.
},
{
    83.14,85.4
     So overworking the back doing a
},
{
    85.4,91.36
     really long back workout, he was also doing flies which moves the scapula.
},
{
    91.36,97.04
     Both of those things can cause spasm in that muscle especially if it's overused.
},
{
    97.04,102.52
     Another patient had been on a long car ride over the mountains and had slept in
},
{
    102.52,107.74
     a different bed and maybe it was the way she was sitting in the car or just the act of sitting for a longer period of
},
{
    107.74,110.9
     time. Who knows what it was but for whatever reason she had that same
},
{
    110.9,116.06
     muscle spasm up on her and then another patient just woke up with spasm and it
},
{
    116.06,120.1
     may been that her pillow was not quite right for her neck and so the way she
},
{
    120.1,124.18
     slept it caused spasm again in that muscle but it can be extremely painful.
},
{
    124.18,128.14
     It can cause a lot of pain in the neck and or the shoulder.
},
{
    128.14,130.2
     And so they come in and they start, they're complaining,
},
{
    130.2,131.04
     hey, my neck hurts.
},
{
    131.04,133.0
     You know, I feel like I can't move my neck very well.
},
{
    133.0,133.84
     It's really tight.
},
{
    133.84,134.66
     It's right here.
},
{
    134.66,135.6
     It keeps spasming up.
},
{
    135.6,137.08
     It hurts especially when I move.
},
{
    137.08,140.24
     So how can we do what is one easy stretch
},
{
    140.24,143.52
     that we can do to help alleviate that spasm
},
{
    143.52,148.88
     or muscle tightness in the levator scapula muscle. So one easy stretch you can do is keeping your
},
{
    148.88,152.72
     shoulders pulled away from your ears. So keeping your shoulders down, you're
},
{
    152.72,156.56
     going to bring your nose, if it's the right side that we're stretching, towards
},
{
    156.56,164.6
     your left knee. So I'm going to look and stretch down towards my left knee. I'm
},
{
    164.6,166.96
     going to hold that stretch for 30 seconds to two
},
{
    166.96,172.0
     minutes. You can add a little extra pressure by pulling forward on your head
},
{
    172.0,177.84
     gently and you're going to feel stretch from up here down to the top of your
},
{
    177.84,181.68
     shoulder. Another one you can do to further stretch it. If that doesn't feel
},
{
    181.68,190.04
     like that's getting it, you can actually bring your arm behind your back, again shoulder out of the ear. This is going to
},
{
    190.04,195.0
     pull the scapula down this way and then you're going to do the same thing. So
},
{
    195.0,204.4
     we're stretching the right side, nose towards your left knee and hold. And then
},
{
    204.4,207.08
     we would repeat the same thing on the left side. If the left side
},
{
    207.08,212.54
     was affected then you'd be bringing your nose towards your right knee. And that's
},
{
    212.54,215.42
     going to stretch that muscle. That's an easy stretch you can do. Again you're
},
{
    215.42,219.5
     going to want to hold that for 30 seconds to two minutes to stretch that muscle.
},
{
    219.5,224.14
     If you're having spasm in the levator scapula specifically, this will also get
},
{
    224.14,225.8
     some of the upper trap in there. But we're addressing the levator scapula specifically. This will also get some of the upper trap in there,
},
{
    225.8,228.0
     but we're addressing the levator scapula.
},
{
    228.0,230.44
     If you have any questions about what this muscle does
},
{
    230.44,231.72
     or questions about this stretch,
