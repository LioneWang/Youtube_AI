     Bob and Brad, the two most famous physical therapists
},
{
    6.72,8.04
     on the internet.
},
{
    11.2,13.04
     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.
},
{
    13.04,14.36
     Brad Heineck, physical therapist.
},
{
    14.36,16.56
     We are the most famous physical therapists on the internet.
},
{
    16.56,18.16
     In our opinion, of course, Bob.
},
{
    18.16,19.72
     Part of our assessment series,
},
{
    19.72,22.04
     what is causing your shoulder pain,
},
{
    22.04,24.44
     frozen shoulder, how to tell?
},
{
    24.44,25.28
     Okay then. We've gone through all the other things that possibly could be, could it pain, frozen shoulder, how to tell? Okay then.
},
{
    25.28,26.76
     We've gone through all the other things
},
{
    26.76,29.28
     that possibly could be a frozen shoulder.
},
{
    29.28,30.4
     Assessment series.
},
{
    30.4,32.2
     Right, well we were going for the shoulder.
},
{
    32.2,33.68
     For the shoulder, okay, sure.
},
{
    33.68,35.14
     So when you have a frozen shoulder,
},
{
    35.14,37.52
     the main symptoms are pain and stiffness,
},
{
    37.52,40.4
     with nearly all movements of the shoulder.
},
{
    40.4,43.72
     That's the telltale sign, that's the gold standard.
},
{
    43.72,45.2
     What do you mean all movements? Every movement, every direction, and that's what the teststale sign, the gold standard. What do you mean all movements?
},
{
    45.2,46.64
     Every movement, every direction.
},
{
    46.64,48.32
     And that's what the tests are gonna be.
},
{
    48.32,50.4
     And we can jump right into that.
},
{
    50.4,52.4
     We'll break it down to a system.
},
{
    52.4,55.24
     So the first test, now you can do this standing,
},
{
    55.24,57.24
     but stand in front of a mirror
},
{
    57.24,61.2
     and you're gonna check your non-involved shoulder first.
},
{
    61.2,62.08
     Good idea.
},
{
    62.08,66.68
     So that's, let's say my shoulder problem is on my right side.
},
{
    66.68,69.68
     So I check my left side, I see how far it goes up.
},
{
    71.32,72.16
     Right.
},
{
    72.16,72.98
     That's pretty normal.
},
{
    72.98,75.16
     So the frozen shoulder, most often,
},
{
    75.16,77.52
     it's not gonna even hit parallel,
},
{
    77.52,79.84
     which is right straight out like that.
},
{
    79.84,81.4
     It's gonna be like that or less
},
{
    81.4,82.68
     when you compare it to the other arm.
},
{
    82.68,85.78
     So this'll be like this, this'll be like that.
},
{
    85.78,88.32
     Typically painful or just feeling painful?
},
{
    88.32,91.96
     Especially in the first stage, the freezing stage.
},
{
    91.96,95.04
     It could also be an impingement though,
},
{
    95.04,95.88
     going this way yet.
},
{
    95.88,96.76
     Sure, wrap.
},
{
    96.76,99.36
     So that's why we're gonna check another one.
},
{
    99.36,101.72
     So this time we're gonna raise out to the side.
},
{
    101.72,104.4
     So thumb up, I'm gonna raise up to the side,
},
{
    104.4,106.8
     I'm gonna go up as far as I can go.
},
{
    106.8,108.36
     Are you gonna go all the way up?
},
{
    108.36,109.92
     Well, I can go that high.
},
{
    109.92,111.4
     Okay. I don't know.
},
{
    111.4,113.0
     And then I'm gonna check with the other side.
},
{
    113.0,114.8
     And the other side again,
},
{
    114.8,119.08
     is probably not gonna go any farther past parallel.
},
{
    119.08,119.92
     It's gonna-
},
{
    119.92,120.76
     Thumb up. Thumb up.
},
{
    120.76,122.04
     Right.
},
{
    122.04,124.68
     So, and again, could be painful.
},
{
    124.68,127.96
     The last one, you're gonna bend your arms to 90 degrees,
},
{
    127.96,129.24
     like that, yep.
},
{
    129.24,131.82
     And you're gonna go ahead and turn them out.
},
{
    131.82,136.08
     Now, the non-involved one should go out quite far,
},
{
    136.08,140.6
     but this one is not gonna go out very far at all.
},
{
    140.6,143.88
     And keep note, the elbows stay close to the ribs.
},
{
    143.88,145.72
     You don't let them go out like this.
},
{
    145.72,149.28
     That's important for that particular test.
},
{
    149.28,150.68
     Yeah, if all three,
},
{
    150.68,154.24
     you know, if all three movements are affected
},
{
    154.24,156.4
     and you weren't having trouble with your shoulder before,
},
{
    156.4,157.52
     just kind of came on,
},
{
    158.74,161.52
     then I think it's time to see the doctor and get a diagnosis,
},
{
    161.52,163.56
     but I'm guessing you have a frozen shoulder.
},
{
    163.56,164.8
     That's a pretty good sign.
},
{
    164.8,165.64
     Right.
},
{
    165.64,168.92
     If it's shoulder impingement, this one will hurt
},
{
    168.92,170.44
     and be limited.
},
{
    170.44,171.96
     This one may be too.
},
{
    171.96,173.64
     And this one.
},
{
    173.64,174.48
     Unlikely.
},
{
    174.48,175.32
     Yeah.
},
{
    175.32,176.16
     Not so much.
},
{
    176.16,179.8
     It can be painful, but the frozen shoulder
},
{
    179.8,183.56
     more presents itself, I would say more stiffness.
},
{
    183.56,184.88
     Right.
},
{
    184.88,187.54
     Pain though, I mean, especially at night.
},
{
    187.54,190.16
     In fact, let's talk about this, Brad.
},
{
    190.16,194.92
     So some of the signs, some of the commonalities among it,
},
{
    194.92,199.92
     women greater than men, often between the age of 40 and 60.
},
{
    200.84,203.2
     And I have to admit, the ones I've seen
},
{
    203.2,205.4
     are almost fit right along, right in this category.
},
{
    205.4,210.4
     But increase risk if you have diabetes.
},
{
    211.08,216.08
     So also this is very common if you've had recent trauma.
},
{
    217.52,218.36
     It's like-
},
{
    218.36,219.2
     Shoulder injury.
},
{
    219.2,220.52
     Yeah, shoulder injury or surgery.
},
{
    220.52,221.36
     Okay.
},
{
    221.36,223.24
     Especially if you had an arm fracture.
},
{
    223.24,224.56
     Oh, right.
},
{
    224.56,227.2
     It definitely sets this process off.
},
{
    227.2,229.24
     It's a weird thing, frozen shoulder.
},
{
    229.24,230.64
     It's really a strange thing
},
{
    230.64,233.66
     because as we'll talk about some of our videos,
},
{
    233.66,235.28
     it tends to get better on its own
},
{
    235.28,238.36
     but it can take months, even years.
},
{
    238.36,240.36
     So I hate to discourage you but.
},
{
    241.16,242.8
     I don't even like to say the years
},
{
    242.8,243.92
     because that depresses me.
},
{
    243.92,244.76
     Sure.
},
{
    244.76,245.76
     And we'll show you some things
},
{
    245.76,247.52
     to hopefully make it not years.
},
{
    247.52,248.68
     You know, oh.
},
{
    248.68,250.52
     No, I was gonna mention a couple other things Brad.
},
{
    250.52,251.36
     Do you wanna say it first?
},
{
    251.36,252.2
     Go ahead.
},
{
    252.2,253.92
     Well, I wanted to get back to,
},
{
    253.92,256.28
     because it just crossed my mind is I agree.
},
{
    256.28,258.8
     If it is an impingement, this'll hurt.
},
{
    258.8,260.64
     But oftentimes if you help with the other hand,
},
{
    260.64,264.28
     once he gets so far up, then it's better up here.
},
{
    264.28,265.12
     And it's a very good. And it hurts here.
},
{
    265.12,266.32
     That's a very good point, Brad.
},
{
    266.32,268.8
     If you have a frozen shoulder, you can hear it.
},
{
    268.8,270.08
     It's like you're hitting a wall.
},
{
    270.08,270.92
     Right, right.
},
{
    270.92,273.84
     It's not, you can't bring it up there very easy.
},
{
    273.84,274.68
     Right.
},
{
    274.68,276.72
     And so that would help dilinate
},
{
    276.72,279.0
     whether it is impinging if you have a question.
},
{
    279.0,282.76
     This is actually called painful arc syndrome
},
{
    282.76,284.12
     because it's so common.
},
{
    284.12,285.72
     Right in here, it's more painful,
},
{
    285.72,288.08
     but if you help or sometimes you can reach through it
},
{
    288.08,290.16
     and then it comes up and it's not so bad,
},
{
    290.16,291.48
     then it's definitely not for the shoulder.
},
{
    291.48,293.04
     If you're hitting a wall,
},
{
    293.04,296.2
     that means that capsule is tightened up on you
},
{
    296.2,298.12
     and both ways end this way.
},
{
    298.12,300.08
     It just doesn't wanna move.
},
{
    300.08,302.96
     So also increased risk if you have heart disease,
},
{
    302.96,304.84
     thyroid disease, Parkinson's,
},
{
    304.84,307.04
     they're all tied to frozen shoulder.
},
{
    307.04,310.02
     Definitely hard to sleep at night due to the pain.
},
{
    310.02,312.08
     In fact, the last patient I saw this,
},
{
    312.08,314.0
     actually a person that works for us,
},
{
    315.12,317.12
     he was having trouble sleeping.
},
{
    317.12,317.88
     I mean.
},
{
    317.88,319.56
     Laying on it or just in general?
},
{
    319.56,320.4
     Just in general.
},
{
    320.4,321.24
     Okay.
},
{
    321.24,322.52
     It's just, you know, it's going through
},
{
    322.52,326.9
     that freezing process, inflammation. And I think when it's going through that,
},
{
    326.9,329.44
     he got a cortisone shot and it did help.
},
{
    329.44,333.08
     So when he says freezing, that's just a term
},
{
    333.08,333.92
     they medically came up with.
},
{
    333.92,336.2
     Yeah, we'll be doing some videos,
},
{
    336.2,338.68
     video describing the three phases.
},
{
    338.68,339.52
     Okay.
},
{
    339.52,341.48
     Freezing, frozen, and thawing.
},
{
    341.48,342.32
     Thawing, yeah.
},
{
    342.32,344.2
     Just like winter time.
},
{
    344.2,345.04
     Just like winter. There you go. Like frost to the snow, man. So, all right, just like winter time. Just like winter.
},
{
    345.04,345.88
     There you go.
},
{
    345.88,347.04
     Like frost to the snowman.
},
{
    347.04,None
     So, all right, thanks everybody for watching. you
},
