     sure you click on the link up there. So we're going to just go with a 30-second stretch.
},
{
    29.2,33.84
     We're going to do a total of three and a little 10-second rest in between. So I've got my timer
},
{
    33.84,39.2
     ready to go and I'll kind of just explain it as we get started. So let's go ahead and start with
},
{
    39.2,44.64
     the first stretch. So the rhomboids are in the back. They kind of hold those shoulder blades
},
{
    44.64,45.52
     together. So you're going to clasp your the back. They kind of hold those shoulder blades together.
},
{
    45.52,49.74
     So you're going to clasp your hands together and you're going to punch forward. Now as
},
{
    49.74,53.96
     you punch forward, you're going to tuck your chin in. So really just trying to round out
},
{
    53.96,58.52
     your shoulders. So if you watch a lot of my videos, you know, usually I don't want people
},
{
    58.52,62.98
     to round out their shoulders, but to get that rhomboid stretch, you really just want to punch
},
{
    62.98,66.28
     forward as much as you can and tuck that chin in.
},
{
    66.28,70.84
     So you're getting that nice stretch in your upper back area.
},
{
    70.84,74.64
     So the rhomboids are the ones that squeeze those shoulder blades in.
},
{
    74.64,79.36
     They're right in between and they connect into the spine and on those shoulder blades
},
{
    79.36,80.36
     and squeeze them in.
},
{
    80.36,86.68
     So a lot of times, those get really tight and irritated when you're sitting at a desk for a long time
},
{
    86.96,92.02
     Maybe if you're driving or you know, even if you have to do a lot of lifting things that work
},
{
    92.04,96.94
     So this is a great stretch to do you can do it standing up. You don't have to do it sitting down
},
{
    97.36,100.64
     You can even do it on the floor with your legs straight up in front of you
},
{
    100.64,103.04
     but really just punching forward and
},
{
    103.28,105.28
     Tucking that chin in and you should feel
},
{
    105.28,110.48
     all that stretch in your upper back area and it feels really good and it just kind of lets everything
},
{
    110.48,117.2
     be nice and relaxed. So again just kind of right through there is where you should feel it and just
},
{
    117.2,122.64
     kind of in between just get it nice and relaxed and shake it out a little bit and then go back
},
{
    122.64,127.2
     into the last stretch right here. again punching forward far as you comfortably can
},
{
    127.68,131.0
     Tucking in try and keep the lower part of your back straight though
},
{
    131.0,132.56
     So you're not punching forward like that
},
{
    132.56,140.4
     You're really just curling that top part forward and punching as far as you can getting that nice good stretch in there
},
{
    141.2,153.52
     And that stretching should never be painful. It should just feel a little bit of tension kind of stretch in there. And that stretching should never be painful, it should just feel a little bit of tension kind of stretch in there. So there you have it, a nice
},
{
    153.52,157.36
     quick one just to kind of loosen things up. Again this is part of my office
},
{
    157.36,161.24
