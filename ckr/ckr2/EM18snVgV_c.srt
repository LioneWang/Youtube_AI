     Hi, I'm Dr. Adam Fields. Let's stretch and strengthen your TMJ. We're going to start with chin tucks.
},
{
    6.0,13.0
     What you do is take a breath in and when you breathe out, I want you to push your head back over your shoulders like this.
},
{
    13.0,19.0
     And let it relax for a second. Take another big breath and push it back.
},
{
    19.0,26.24
     Push, push, push, push. You're lifting and you're really opening up your suboccipitals when you do this and that helps relax the TMJ.
},
{
    26.24,29.52
     Once again, big breath in and breathe out.
},
{
    30.52,33.12
     I'm going to show you from the side. Big breath in and
},
{
    34.64,36.64
     push, push, push, push, push, push.
},
{
    37.6,42.04
     Good. Feel it. Feel it back there. Feel this lift. Feel the muscles get strong.
},
{
    42.2,45.94
     Most of us are like this. It tightens here and tightens the TMJ.
},
{
    45.94,49.22
     Big breath in and push it back.
},
{
    52.22,53.44
     Push, push.
},
{
    53.44,54.82
     Good.
},
{
    54.82,56.02
     Big breath in.
},
{
    57.12,59.44
     As you push, tuck the chin.
},
{
    59.44,60.94
     Let's see a double chin on you.
},
{
    61.96,63.18
     Good.
},
{
    63.18,66.48
     Okay, now we're gonna do a little thumb resistance exercise. Get that
},
{
    66.48,73.2
     thumb right under your jaw. I want you to open your mouth and close your mouth with resistance.
},
{
    73.2,76.0
     We're going to open it about four seconds, close about four seconds.
},
{
    80.24,86.4
     So just go ahead and open that mouth wide. make sure the resistance is coming on the way open and
},
{
    86.52,89.18
     When you're closing you don't want to close quick on this one
},
{
    95.28,99.78
     The next one is also for the occipital right here take this part of your knuckle
},
{
    100.2,110.12
     This part of your knuckle put it right behind his bone behind your ear like, with the fingers pointing up your head and the same thing on the other side,
},
{
    110.12,114.24
     lift the suboccipital and pull down on the opposite side.
},
{
    114.24,116.68
     Go to the other side, lift.
},
{
    116.68,117.68
     Good.
},
{
    117.68,119.52
     This one is amazing.
},
{
    119.52,123.72
     People come into my office, they have a headache, oh, give me those occipital lifts.
},
{
    123.72,124.72
     Like, how's that?
},
{
    124.72,126.2
     Oh, whoa, it's much better.
},
{
    126.2,132.6
     Research shows that when the occipitals get tight, the masseter, the jaw muscle gets tight,
},
{
    132.6,147.36
     and we don't want those clenches tight. We want the clenches more relaxed and every other muscle working a little bit better, a little bit stronger.
},
{
    152.24,158.04
     Good. Okay, let's go ahead and do some tongue range of motion. So you're going
},
{
    158.04,162.12
     to bring your tongue to the back of your throat, hold it for about three four
},
{
    162.12,167.52
     seconds, then we're going to go to one side and the other side as you push out your cheek. Let's go ahead and do it to
},
{
    167.52,173.4
     the back. Glide that tip of your tongue towards your tonsils. You're going to hold
},
{
    173.4,179.88
     that for a while. Your tongue is going to go then to your left cheek. Hold that for
},
{
    179.88,187.5
     a while and to the right cheek. You're going to find this tickles your tongue a little bit and it tickles
},
{
    187.5,194.28
     the top of your mouth. You're opening your mouth wide and pushing your tongue against your cheek.
},
{
    194.28,205.9
     Keep that mouth wide open. The tongue is a worker. Let's exercise it. It helps in mixing your foods.
},
{
    205.9,217.22
     It binds and contorts itself in all different ways in the form of letters and speech.
},
{
    217.22,224.86
     Even when you sleep, your tongue is constantly pushing saliva down your throat.
},
{
    224.86,227.0
     Very good. Now we're going to open the jaw. We're going to move
},
{
    227.0,230.16
     it with your mouth really wide open. We're just going to move that jaw a little bit
},
{
    230.16,236.24
     to the left and to the right. So open wide. Feel a stretch on the muscles on the side
},
{
    236.24,241.36
     that you're pushing your jaw towards. You're kind of just moving it back and forth, moving
},
{
    241.36,248.88
     it back. One side might feel a little tighter than the other and really accentuate. Something feels tight go into a little bit. It's a slight movement. You're going to feel
},
{
    248.88,251.76
     your jaw exercise though. This is going to be a good one.
},
{
    255.36,257.44
     Oh that's good. Let's massage a little bit.
},
{
    259.52,264.16
     You can get your knuckles in there. Okay now we're going to go up right up where the cheeks are
},
{
    264.16,266.8
     and find some right where those cheek buns are,
},
{
    266.8,269.6
     find some tender spots and you're gonna open your mouth.
},
{
    270.92,272.24
     This one's pretty intense.
},
{
    276.4,277.48
     Feel the pain.
},
{
    288.6,295.8
     Ooh, it's a good one. If you're not feeling it, lock yourself underneath that cheekbone.
},
{
    295.8,307.84
     This one's my favorite.
},
{
    307.84,308.84
     It opens the jaw.
},
{
    308.84,311.84
     I want you to listen to your voice after you do this also.
},
{
    311.84,315.88
     We're going to work the mouth openers on this.
},
{
    315.88,320.2
     Your tongue is going to be pushed against the lower teeth and curled forward and the
},
{
    320.2,322.24
     mouth is going to be open.
},
{
    322.24,327.44
     Give yourself really good posture on this perfect proud posture.
},
{
    327.44,331.76
     Give yourself a proud posture that really push your head back over your shoulders and
},
{
    331.76,334.0
     give your mouth as wide as you can.
},
{
    334.0,336.68
     Push that tongue down on top of the teeth.
},
{
    336.68,341.92
     You're really working the antagonistic muscles to the clenches and opening the back of your
},
{
    341.92,342.92
     throat.
},
{
    342.92,344.68
     You'll love what this does for your voice.
},
{
    344.68,348.2
     You'll get some of your more depth in your voice. You'll feel a vibration in
},
{
    348.2,353.2
     your skull. It's really going to help your TMJ also.
},
{
    353.44,358.84
     Alright good. Next we're going to massage the back of your skull. Let's start with
},
{
    358.84,363.4
     your left hand and you're going to reach it around to the back of your head and
},
{
    363.4,366.68
     get your fingers right underneath your skull.
},
{
    366.68,368.56
     Get right under there.
},
{
    368.56,369.56
     Feel it.
},
{
    369.56,370.56
     You're going to have a little tension under there.
},
{
    370.56,371.56
     Get that middle finger in there.
},
{
    371.56,374.88
     Do some cross fiber massaging.
},
{
    374.88,376.88
     Find any tender spots.
},
{
    376.88,379.12
     Even go a little bit below the suboccipital.
},
{
    379.12,382.56
     Bring your head down a bit if that works better for you.
},
{
    382.56,383.56
     Get way over to the side.
},
{
    383.56,386.0
     Cover the whole span of it.
},
{
    386.0,388.88
     Just work it neat in there.
},
{
    388.88,390.58
     Give yourself some attention here.
},
{
    393.36,394.96
     It's gonna be paying off for you.
},
{
    401.76,404.32
     Okay, we're gonna switch to the other hand.
},
{
    411.64,413.2
     Again, dig on in people. People wondering about healthcare.
},
{
    413.2,419.44
     Well, it's not about healthcare as much as it about self-care.
},
{
    419.44,430.98
     You are with you 24 seven and a little care to yourself is going to go a long way. Bring that head
},
{
    430.98,438.32
     down a little bit if you have to get in there a little bit more. Next we're going
},
{
    438.32,447.76
     to do the open mouth exercise again. My favorite. So go ahead and just give yourself really good posture. The
},
{
    447.76,451.96
     chest is up. Stick that tongue. You're going to be taking the tongue and pushing
},
{
    451.96,484.74
     that jaw down. Open. That was good.
},
{
    484.74,488.4
     Let's massage that TMJ a little bit.
},
{
    488.4,490.12
     That muscle is amazing.
},
{
    490.12,492.52
     That muscle can exert about 200 pounds.
},
{
    492.52,495.76
     The human bite is very dangerous.
},
{
    495.76,499.72
     Strongest bite is size in the human body.
},
{
    499.72,501.72
     Good.
},
{
    501.72,504.92
     Work it a little bit.
},
{
    504.92,505.0
     Okay, we're going to do another open mouth exercise. Good, work it a little bit.
},
{
    505.0,508.24
     Okay, we're gonna do another open mouth exercise.
},
{
    508.24,509.24
     And listen to your voice.
},
{
    509.24,510.64
     Listen to that, hey, how you doing?
},
{
    510.64,512.92
     Let's say it, say hey, how you doing?
},
{
    512.92,516.28
     You'll get a little more resonance in your voice with these exercises.
},
{
    516.28,551.36
     Go ahead and open that mouth again. and Oh, that was great.
},
{
    551.36,554.6
     So a lot of the jaw, really it's about relaxing.
},
{
    554.6,556.56
     A lot of people clench at night.
},
{
    556.56,557.56
     We need to get relaxing.
},
{
    557.56,562.2
     So what we're going to do is we're going to do, we're going to have the tongue touching
},
{
    562.2,563.2
     the rift of the mouth.
},
{
    563.2,568.04
     And we're going to do some inhales and exhales.
},
{
    568.04,572.04
     When you exhale, I want you to think the word peace.
},
{
    572.04,577.8
     Just saying that word peace will turn off certain parts of your brain to decrease the
},
{
    577.8,581.2
     fight or flight response, to decrease stress.
},
{
    581.2,584.56
     Hung up, you can close your eyes.
},
{
    584.56,588.24
     Just relax your eyes, relax your jaw.
},
{
    588.24,591.0
     This is a relaxing pose.
},
{
    591.0,None
     Just breathe in and as you breathe out, say the word peace in your head. you you you you
},
