     In this video, I'm going to show you how to decompress your lower back at home in as little as 30 seconds.

    5.8,6.8
     Stay tuned.

    11.8,14.9
     Hey everyone, Dr. O here at SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan.
},
{
    14.9,22.0
     So we're going to focus on spinal decompression traction exercises for the lower back or the lumbar spine.
},
{
    22.0,29.04
     They're very safe to do. You can do them right at home. They don't require any special equipment. We're going to use gravity to
},
{
    29.04,35.0
     traction or pull into the lower back to relieve pressure on spinal discs. If
},
{
    35.0,39.92
     you're unfamiliar with what traction is, think of it this way. If you put pressure
},
{
    39.92,43.84
     into a spinal disc, it's going to bulge out and cause pinched nerves. You can get
},
{
    43.84,47.32
     a sciatic-like pain going down the leg from that.
},
{
    47.32,51.4
     With this, what we're going to do instead is try to reverse that pressure by pulling
},
{
    51.4,52.4
     on it.
},
{
    52.4,55.72
     If you've got it squished, if we can pull on that, it's going to come back in, hopefully
},
{
    55.72,59.0
     off those nerves and make you feel a lot better.
},
{
    59.0,62.4
     Let's get started with them and make sure to give all of these exercises a try and go
},
{
    62.4,64.52
     with the ones that work best for you.
},
{
    64.52,65.04
     With this first traction exercise, you can do this laying flat on your stomach at the make sure to give all of these exercises a try and go with the ones that work best for you.
},
{
    65.04,69.0
     With this first traction exercise, you can do this laying flat on your stomach at the
},
{
    69.0,70.24
     edge of a bed.
},
{
    70.24,72.12
     Let's progress into this one slowly.
},
{
    72.12,77.12
     We're going to go from a light traction into the lower back to a deep, deep stretch.
},
{
    77.12,81.32
     So what I'm going to do first is just go to the edge of the bed and allow my shoulders
},
{
    81.32,83.16
     and my head to hang off.
},
{
    83.16,85.0
     So just like this. And what I'm also going to do is bring my arms, straighten them and put them off and my head to hang off. So just like this.
},
{
    85.0,87.56
     And what I'm also going to do is bring my arms
},
{
    87.56,89.8
     straighten them and put them off to my side.
},
{
    89.8,92.32
     But I want to keep just bringing the head down
},
{
    92.32,95.8
     as much as I can, almost like a chin tucking position.
},
{
    95.8,97.52
     Once I feel a very good stretch,
},
{
    97.52,100.26
     I hold that for up to 30 seconds.
},
{
    100.26,103.18
     If you feel like this right here is not enough,
},
{
    103.18,105.82
     just simply use your feet to kick yourself
},
{
    105.82,110.58
     forward and bring more of the upper body off of the bed.
},
{
    110.58,112.36
     Gravity will take care of the rest.
},
{
    112.36,116.7
     The more that you bring that upper body off, the more intense the stretch is going to become
},
{
    116.7,118.2
     in the lower back.
},
{
    118.2,120.66
     Only go to your comfort level.
},
{
    120.66,130.0
     So as you continually bring the upper body off of your bed, you can also then use your arms right here to stabilize this movement.
},
{
    130.0,138.0
     And just keep going forward with it until you feel like only your pelvis and hips are supported by the bed.
},
{
    138.0,147.88
     The upper body is completely taken off the bed and gravity is taking care of the rest. I then like to place my upper body weight on my elbows and my forearms like this and
},
{
    147.88,151.38
     just let everything sag downwards.
},
{
    151.38,155.36
     Gravity again is going to take care of the rest and you should feel a very good traction
},
{
    155.36,156.92
     into the lower back.
},
{
    156.92,161.96
     Hold this for 30 seconds if you're able to, relax and then repeat it 3-5 times.
},
{
    161.96,166.08
     It should help relieve a lot of pressure into the lower back, so give it a try.
},
{
    166.08,168.76
     For this next one, you can also use a bed.
},
{
    168.76,172.78
     You can also use a sturdy table as long as it feels like it's high enough to be able
},
{
    172.78,173.94
     to do this stretch.
},
{
    173.94,176.2
     I'm going to place a pillow at the edge.
},
{
    176.2,181.4
     What I'm going to do is put my hips and stomach on that pillow.
},
{
    181.4,189.12
     I'm going to position myself at the edge to where my legs are going to be able to go straight down towards the floor. The hips, the knees
},
{
    189.12,193.98
     should almost be like a nice straight line down towards the floor. From there,
},
{
    193.98,198.06
     what I'm going to do is put my upper body weight onto my elbows right here, onto
},
{
    198.06,204.4
     my arms, and let the lower body weight just sag towards the floor. Let gravity
},
{
    204.4,205.72
     take it.
},
{
    205.72,211.52
     You're going to start to feel as a very good stretch right here into the lower back.
},
{
    211.52,217.0
     What I can do is actually lift my toes up like this if you would like to get a very
},
{
    217.0,220.48
     good stretch into the lower back.
},
{
    220.48,223.12
     Just position your toes to where you feel comfortable.
},
{
    223.12,227.7
     Obviously, you want to support yourself and you can hold this one for upwards to 30 seconds
},
{
    227.7,231.82
     or longer if you do feel comfortable doing it.
},
{
    231.82,238.74
     This next exercise is a modified version of the yoga pose, the downward facing dog, which
},
{
    238.74,241.78
     is a very good decompressive stretch in its own right.
},
{
    241.78,244.42
     If you've never tried that pose before, check it out.
},
{
    244.42,248.16
     It might help. But what we're going to need is a chair. You want one that's
},
{
    248.16,252.6
     sturdy, no wheels on it. I'm going to take that pillow and I'm going to place it
},
{
    252.6,255.92
     right here on the back. And what I'm going to do again is I'm going to place
},
{
    255.92,260.08
     my hips, the pelvis over that area, and then from there what I'm going to do is
},
{
    260.08,265.92
     get very good sturdy footing first. And then I'm just gonna take my upper body weight
},
{
    265.92,270.16
     and then start to pivot and lean down towards the floor.
},
{
    270.16,273.0
     What this is going to do is really put a good amount
},
{
    273.0,275.72
     of traction, really good amount of decompressive force
},
{
    275.72,277.28
     into the lower back.
},
{
    277.28,280.16
     You just keep reaching towards the floor
},
{
    280.16,282.68
     until you feel a very good stretch in the back.
},
{
    282.68,287.66
     Go to your comfort level only. Once you you get there let gravity do all the work
},
{
    287.66,292.54
     I'm telling you right now. I feel a great stretch and traction into my lower back
},
{
    292.54,295.32
     I hold this one for 15 to 30 seconds
},
{
    295.34,301.74
     You can then relax if need be and then just repeat until you feel like it's giving you a lot of relief
},
{
    301.74,305.3
     Into the lower back so if you like the video and got a lot of relief,
