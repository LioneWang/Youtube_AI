{
    0.0,6.0
     By the end of this video, you're gonna know exactly how I go about adjusting the person's foot.
},
{
    6.0,9.5
     My name is Dr. Store. I've been a chiropractor for over 24 years.
},
{
    9.5,12.5
     I'm gonna give you realistic advice based on my experience.
},
{
    12.5,17.5
     Now, when you see some people adjusting the foot, you'll see that the person just lying there,
},
{
    17.5,22.5
     they'll grab their foot like this and then just pull, and the patient has their shoe on.
},
{
    22.5,28.12
     Now, that's not very specific, so that person is just doing a long axis distraction of,
},
{
    28.12,30.8
     I don't know what joint, I assume the talus,
},
{
    30.8,32.68
     because that's the only one that they can actually
},
{
    32.68,34.94
     get a hold of, but in this video,
},
{
    34.94,37.3
     you're gonna see how I go about doing it.
},
{
    37.3,42.28
     Now we're gonna be analyzing the subtalar joint,
},
{
    42.28,44.16
     which is this joint right here
},
{
    44.16,46.8
     between the calcaneus and the
},
{
    46.8,51.52
     talus. I'm going to be analyzing the talus, the navicular bone, which is right
},
{
    51.52,57.52
     there, all three cuneiforms and the cuboid. So I hope you enjoy this video. If
},
{
    57.52,60.96
     you're a chiropractor and you're adjusting the foot just by grabbing it
},
{
    60.96,66.16
     and then tractioning it, hopefully this will give you some other information on how
},
{
    66.16,72.32
     to analyze it because it's these subtleties that actually can make a difference. I'm going to show
},
{
    72.32,79.44
     you this. So she had a video conference with her doctor and the doctor said, well if you have foot
},
{
    79.44,85.0
     pain it's probably arch, you probably have lack of art support, right?
},
{
    85.56,89.0
     The problem with video supports or video appointments,
},
{
    89.0,91.0
     you don't actually see the patient.
},
{
    91.0,92.32
     So it's just blanket information,
},
{
    92.32,93.44
     kind of like if you have knee pain,
},
{
    93.44,95.44
     oh, you probably have runner's knee,
},
{
    95.44,96.28
     you have shoulder pain,
},
{
    96.28,97.68
     oh, it's probably a rotator cuff,
},
{
    97.68,99.0
     without ever examining.
},
{
    99.0,101.6
     But you look at her feet, okay?
},
{
    101.6,106.04
     And this is called, from what I remember, a canvas foot.
},
{
    106.04,111.72
     And it's actually, it's usually people who have kind of shorter feet for their height.
},
{
    111.72,115.12
     And then also, like, she's got excellent arches there.
},
{
    115.12,123.12
     Now, the thing is, if she tries to put, tries to make a flat foot, it's almost impossible.
},
{
    123.12,124.12
     It's like rigid.
},
{
    124.12,126.56
     So, hold on to something and put all
},
{
    126.56,134.96
     your body weight on one foot. And if you look over here, she cannot flatten her,
},
{
    137.6,142.8
     she cannot flatten her arch. It's like impossible. Now try to roll your ankle down.
},
{
    145.36,146.0
     it's like impossible. Now try to roll your ankle down. Even if she's rolling it,
},
{
    153.2,156.88
     there's still an arch there. So that's an unusual type of situation and from a chiropractic perspective it's usually a harder area to adjust so I'm going to show you how I adjust this.
},
{
    157.44,162.4
     So let's have you lie down on your back for me.
},
{
    162.6,163.6
     lie down on your back for me. Okay.
},
{
    163.6,168.44
     So you're facing feet over there.
},
{
    168.44,175.2
     And it's both feet that hurt?
},
{
    175.2,176.2
     Yes.
},
{
    176.2,177.2
     Yeah.
},
{
    177.2,178.2
     Equally?
},
{
    178.2,179.2
     It varies.
},
{
    179.2,181.2
     It varies from time to time.
},
{
    181.2,182.2
     Okay.
},
{
    182.2,187.32
     And is there a time of day, like at night time, that it hurts worse at the end of the day?
},
{
    187.32,189.92
     Or is it in the morning when you first get up?
},
{
    189.92,197.28
     Night time. It's more like when I go out for an exercise walk and they start to be hurting.
},
{
    197.28,200.96
     Now what about in the morning when you wake up in the morning? No pain.
},
{
    200.96,205.96
     So the classic, well if your heel hurts it's got to be plantar fasciitis.
},
{
    205.96,210.12
     That makes no sense because plantar fasciitis usually hurts worse in the morning.
},
{
    210.12,214.28
     So what I'm going to do, I'm going to take this bottom bone here and I'm going to shift
},
{
    214.28,217.72
     it back and forth to see what the mobility is like.
},
{
    217.72,220.2
     Okay, actually it's pretty good.
},
{
    220.2,221.2
     Not too bad.
},
{
    221.2,223.08
     And now I'm going to check this one.
},
{
    223.08,225.48
     Now this joint here is locked.
},
{
    225.48,226.48
     It just doesn't want to.
},
{
    226.48,229.64
     You could see her plantar flexion is 90.
},
{
    229.64,232.6
     It should be, I can't even get it there.
},
{
    232.6,235.64
     So yeah, you felt that?
},
{
    235.64,240.88
     So what I'm going to do, the difference here is with this foot, you can't adjust it down
},
{
    240.88,244.04
     up and internally because that's not how her foot works.
},
{
    244.04,245.28
     What I'm going to have to do
},
{
    245.28,251.28
     is I'm going to have to get on the back side here and I'm going to pull it up and down straight
},
{
    251.28,256.16
     down this way to try to get the subtaler joint and then I'm going to adjust the talus and let's see
},
{
    256.16,266.44
     how your, oh that doesn't move very well either. The cuboid.
},
{
    268.6,269.64
     Okay, so the navicular on that one is locked. I'm gonna adjust that.
},
{
    269.64,273.2
     And this one, actually when I check it here,
},
{
    273.2,275.0
     you got a little clickin' goin' on.
},
{
    275.0,276.4
     Can you feel that or no?
},
{
    276.4,277.64
     Uh-huh. You can.
},
{
    277.64,279.56
     Okay, let's see how this one.
},
{
    281.12,284.0
     So has anybody ever adjusted your feet before?
},
{
    284.0,284.84
     I don't know.
},
{
    284.84,288.24
     A prior physical therapist did on my left ankle.
},
{
    288.24,291.24
     This one? Okay. When was that?
},
{
    291.24,295.6
     2012.
},
{
    295.6,299.24
     2012. Okay. So it's probably time for a tune up.
},
{
    299.24,301.92
     Alright, so what I'm gonna do,
},
{
    301.92,308.58
     I'm gonna take my middle finger, Grab underneath the Achilles deep inside there. Okay
},
{
    309.78,315.34
     And so you may not hear anything, but you'll probably feel it. Yeah
},
{
    320.06,326.0
     There we go, you felt that now Now I'm going to do a different one.
},
{
    328.0,331.0
     This time instead of a normal, I usually use my middle finger here.
},
{
    331.0,333.0
     I'm going to use my other middle finger in a different direction.
},
{
    333.0,337.0
     I'm going to be adjusting it that way rather than medial to lateral.
},
{
    338.0,340.0
     Okay, so here we go.
},
{
    340.0,342.0
     I'm going to pull it down this way.
},
{
    342.0,344.0
     One more.
},
{
    345.28,346.12
     Good.
},
{
    346.12,347.36
     Okay.
},
{
    347.36,352.36
     And then, I'm gonna adjust the cuboid downward here.
},
{
    354.8,356.0
     So I need some strength,
},
{
    356.0,357.96
     so I'm gonna get my thumb right on there,
},
{
    357.96,359.64
     hold it with my hand,
},
{
    359.64,363.86
     and then use my body to pull it like that.
},
{
    370.0,372.0
     I'm gonna do this one. Good.
},
{
    372.0,376.0
     Felt that?
},
{
    376.0,378.0
     Yep.
},
{
    378.0,380.0
     Good.
},
{
    380.0,386.0
     And then I'm going to do the, um, actually the cuboid was okay on here.
},
{
    386.0,389.0
     The naviculars on both of these.
},
{
    391.0,393.0
     I'm going to do here.
},
{
    398.0,399.0
     Okay.
},
{
    399.0,401.0
