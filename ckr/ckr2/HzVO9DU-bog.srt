     Hi, I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist, Brad Heineck physical therapist, together we are
},
{
    7.0,9.0
     the most famous physical therapists on the internet.
},
{
    9.0,10.0
     Well in our opinion of course.
},
{
    10.0,13.12
     Brad today we're going to show just a simple technique to help get rid of some of those
},
{
    13.12,16.24
     knots that you might feel in the upper shoulder, upper trapezius.
},
{
    16.24,17.24
     Yep.
},
{
    17.24,21.0
     And this is a technique that you can do yourself and all you need is a tennis ball.
},
{
    21.0,22.0
     Right.
},
{
    22.0,23.0
     And first off, and maybe an island.
},
{
    23.0,24.0
     Sure.
},
{
    24.0,26.96
     That's right, an island and a tennis ball, right, and maybe an nylon, sure that's right, an nylon and a tennis ball. Now what's
},
{
    26.96,33.52
     cool about this is it's very easy to do but the thing is what we're doing here is really kind of
},
{
    33.52,38.72
     unknown Brad, a lot of people have knots in their shoulders and I want you to flip around here Brad,
},
{
    38.72,45.6
     we actually made a symbol here, these are little, but these symbolize are the knots in the shoulders or in the neck or maybe
},
{
    45.6,51.36
     even the lower shoulder, lower trapezius that you may feel. And what these, I think these are
},
{
    51.36,57.04
     about the size of a knot. I'm going to show this. You see that Lonnie? That's too close. Too close.
},
{
    57.6,66.34
     How about that? Yeah. So we don't really know what these are, everybody can speculate what they are thinking, they
},
{
    66.34,71.08
     call them trigger points, but what we do know is if you put pressure on the trigger point
},
{
    71.08,76.0
     and you hold it there for 20 seconds, maybe up to 2 minutes, eventually it dissipates.
},
{
    76.0,80.84
     In other words, it's like taking your finger and put it on an ice cube, eventually it melts
},
{
    80.84,82.28
     and goes away.
},
{
    82.28,88.04
     So put that constant, direct pressure on it, it will actually make it go away. So that's what we're doing with the tennis ball. The
},
{
    88.04,92.84
     tennis ball is going to go right on it and push it and eventually it'll be gone.
},
{
    92.84,97.12
     Sure. We don't know why but it works. So now we'll go over to the wall and we'll
},
{
    97.12,101.04
     show you the demonstration. Right because you know I can click I do this one a
},
{
    101.04,108.2
     lot. Why don't you turn around Bob? Just quickly there's one that I always find right in this area here and I'll work with my fingers
},
{
    108.2,112.76
     and then I'll give the patient if you want to do this at home take a tennis ball and we'll go to this technique.
},
{
    113.64,116.68
     Okay, so for the independent massage or
},
{
    117.44,122.56
     trigger point massage on that point you're going to come back and you will find it. It's not going to be over bone
},
{
    122.56,127.84
     it's going to be over the muscle belly where it's soft and you're going to find a spot that is a
},
{
    127.84,131.76
     little harder and it's quite tender. When you push out it's going to make your eyes
},
{
    131.76,135.54
     open. It's going, oh there it is. There will be no mistake about it. And I found
},
{
    135.54,141.84
     mine right there. So you take the tennis ball, put it here and then you just trap
},
{
    141.84,146.88
     it between the wall and your body and then you simply
},
{
    146.88,151.88
     put pressure on it and I'm not okay right there I'm on it and it's nice if
},
{
    151.88,156.44
     you have a clock hanging on the wall or you time it you want to go 30 seconds up
},
{
    156.44,161.52
     to two minutes and typically what I find with patients is after about 20 to 30
},
{
    161.52,169.52
     seconds the pain level starts to drop and then it just starts to fade, fade, fade, fade. It's one of those pains that feels so good it
},
{
    169.52,173.02
     hurts so good you can kind of get that feeling if you have that and it's
},
{
    173.02,176.9
     decreasing as you hold the pressure on there you're right on the money okay
},
{
    176.9,181.5
     you're going to get rid of that trigger point and that not. So if you don't have
},
{
    181.5,185.82
     if you have shoulder problems you can't get back there or it's down farther in your back
},
{
    185.96,190.98
     It's really hard to get there so let that bowl drop and stick it in a nylon
},
{
    191.52,194.22
     Got a good use for those nylon after they're
},
{
    195.48,197.48
     Used and abused
},
{
    197.92,199.92
     I strain paint with these too sometimes Bob
},
{
    200.56,202.32
     Swing it like that
},
{
    202.32,205.36
     Then you can have some fun
},
{
    210.8,214.92
     Okay, so I'm gonna get back there and if you have a lower one right between the scapula and the spine is right fine We're in a lot of times on people and oh, I'm on it right now. I can
},
{
    219.56,220.88
     Wow
},
{
    220.88,224.12
     Okay, right there had to move up a little bit. I'm on it right now
},
{
    224.84,225.36
     You want us to leave you alone Brad? Wow, okay right there, I had to move up a little bit. I'm on it right now.
},
{
    225.36,226.52
     You want us to leave you alone Brad?
},
{
    226.52,228.0
     That's okay Bob, it's getting better.
},
{
    228.0,231.56
     It's getting better even after about 10 or 15 seconds here.
},
{
    231.56,233.28
     I'm gonna just go up and down.
},
{
    233.28,235.92
     And these tennis balls really, really work well.
},
{
    235.92,236.76
     Nice pressure.
},
{
    236.76,238.92
     Because you know, people that do this all the time,
},
{
    238.92,240.32
     I don't do it a lot in the clinic,
},
{
    240.32,243.0
     but I do it enough where my thumbs get tired.
},
{
    243.0,245.24
     I'll start using my knuckles or my elbow
},
{
    245.28,249.94
     It's a lot of work for those massage therapists or therapists that use this a lot. It's getting better now
},
{
    249.94,253.64
     The only thing is you have to steal the ball from your dog. Yeah, yeah
},
{
    253.64,258.6
     And then if your dog is chewing on your ankle while you're doing this you got to get a little over out of there
},
{
    258.64,261.32
     But there you go. That's the number if you haven't already
