    46.32,47.32
     He said mattress.
},
{
    47.32,49.52
     We're giving a nice sleep-ovation mattress.
},
{
    49.52,50.88
     This is not a full mattress.
},
{
    50.88,52.36
     This is just a little sample of it,
},
{
    52.36,54.96
     but it's got 700 individual mattresses.
},
{
    54.96,57.4
     It's got air channels, so it's nice and cool.
},
{
    57.4,59.16
     Provides a comfort you just won't find
},
{
    59.16,60.32
     on a regular mattress.
},
{
    60.32,61.32
     I love mine, Bob.
},
{
    61.32,62.68
     Yeah, I do too.
},
{
    62.68,65.14
     Now you don't use that word lightly.
},
{
    65.14,69.1

},
{
    72.1,73.02
     There you go.
},
{
    73.02,76.34
     So what we're talking about here, Brad, is Dom's.
},
{
    76.34,78.66
     Delayed onset muscle soreness.
},
{
    78.66,80.06
     This is the kind of soreness.
},
{
    80.06,82.94
     Brad, when I was in college, believe it or not,
},
{
    82.94,86.28
     I used to lift weights almost like an hour
},
{
    86.28,88.48
     to an hour and a half every day.
},
{
    88.48,89.92
     Well, five days a week.
},
{
    89.92,90.76
     Five days a week.
},
{
    90.76,91.6
     Yeah, weekdays.
},
{
    91.6,94.12
     And I was sore all the time.
},
{
    94.12,95.48
     You thought that was good.
},
{
    95.48,96.88
     I thought that was good.
},
{
    96.88,99.48
     And I was in pretty good shape,
},
{
    99.48,100.84
     but I was pretty strong,
},
{
    100.84,102.6
     but I think I could have been a lot stronger
},
{
    102.6,104.64
     and a lot better shape if I would have.
},
{
    104.64,105.48
     So.
},
{
    105.48,106.32
     Trained a little more wise.
},
{
    106.32,111.32
     By wise, I used to eat a whole box of hamburger helper
},
{
    112.4,117.4
     along with a whole pound of hamburger in one setting.
},
{
    117.4,119.44
     I mean, that's how much you could eat back then.
},
{
    119.44,120.28
     So, you know.
},
{
    120.28,121.32
     Oh, you just ate, because you're hungry,
},
{
    121.32,122.68
     because you thought that was gonna help.
},
{
    122.68,123.92
     Well, I was that hungry.
},
{
    123.92,126.96
     I mean, I could, you know, I was six foot six, weight 225.
},
{
    126.96,129.32
     You know, it was all muscle, so anyway,
},
{
    129.32,131.48
     I'm off on a tangent here.
},
{
    131.48,133.08
     So anyway, when you get doms,
},
{
    133.08,135.88
     what's happening is during the eccentric movement.
},
{
    135.88,138.0
     So let's say I'm doing bicep red.
},
{
    138.0,138.84
     I'm bringing it up.
},
{
    138.84,140.48
     That's concentric.
},
{
    140.48,145.06
     On the way down, that's eccentric, under tension.
},
{
    145.06,147.54
     That's where you can cause microscopic tears.
},
{
    147.54,149.02
     Right.
},
{
    149.02,151.18
     I remember doing plyometric once.
},
{
    151.18,152.02
     Sure.
},
{
    152.02,153.58
     Oh my God, did I get sore?
},
{
    153.58,154.62
     What were you like doing?
},
{
    154.62,155.62
     Push-up ones or jumping?
},
{
    155.62,156.62
     No hops.
},
{
    156.62,157.46
     Hopping, okay.
},
{
    157.46,160.1
     And you really get a lot of eccentric motion on there
},
{
    160.1,164.34
     and they really, the problem with the doms,
},
{
    164.34,167.28
     and you know, it's part of muscle growth,
},
{
    167.28,168.88
     but if you do it too much,
},
{
    168.88,171.72
     it can negatively impact your training.
},
{
    171.72,175.4
     They found one study where it reduced your force capacity
},
{
    175.4,176.44
     by 50%.
},
{
    176.44,179.08
     So like if you were really sore the next day,
},
{
    179.08,180.56
     you could only lift about half
},
{
    180.56,182.84
     of what you could normally lift.
},
{
    182.84,186.12
     So I remember we used to say this
},
{
    186.12,187.88
     and it's so true today, Brad.
},
{
    187.88,189.08
     You gotta listen to your body.
},
{
    189.08,192.5
     And it's just not good to work through
},
{
    192.5,194.28
     if you're just, your body's just saying,
},
{
    194.28,196.08
     no, no, no, I need time to rest.
},
{
    196.08,199.52
     Right, there's one thing to work through that fatigue,
},
{
    199.52,201.76
     but if you're fatigued all the time
},
{
    201.76,204.4
     and your body's saying, I need a rest.
},
{
    204.4,205.76
     You're not doing yourself anything.
},
{
    205.76,206.6
     Right.
},
{
    206.6,207.44
     Then it's time.
},
{
    207.44,210.0
     You could still do a really light active recovery workout.
},
{
    210.0,210.84
     We got that.
},
{
    210.84,212.32
     Oh, I'm sorry, jumping ahead.
},
{
    212.32,213.16
     Jumping ahead.
},
{
    213.16,214.76
     So we'll talk about the five right here now.
},
{
    214.76,216.6
     Number one is actually sleep.
},
{
    217.66,218.98
     This is very interesting, Brad.
},
{
    218.98,222.32
     I found LeBron James, you know, superstar athlete.
},
{
    222.32,223.16
     Basketball player.
},
{
    223.16,224.26
     Basketball player, yes.
},
{
    224.26,227.32
     After a game night, how much does he sleep?
},
{
    227.32,228.16
     Pick a guess.
},
{
    228.16,229.28
     He's probably a partian.
},
{
    229.28,230.12
     No, he's not.
},
{
    230.12,231.32
     And that's the thing.
},
{
    231.32,232.44
     12 hours.
},
{
    232.44,233.28
     Oh.
},
{
    233.28,237.16
     And he is a personal nutritionist and trainer and all that.
},
{
    237.16,241.56
     Active, very important for recovery is to get that sleep.
},
{
    241.56,243.96
     So a lot of times they said he does 12 hours
},
{
    243.96,245.48
     and maybe even a nap along with it.
},
{
    245.48,248.16
     So I used to harp on this with my son.
},
{
    248.16,251.36
     It's like, this is an important part of the training
},
{
    251.36,253.08
     as it is the training itself.
},
{
    253.08,254.64
     You gotta have that recovery time.
},
{
    254.64,257.24
     So I did use to sleep a lot in college.
},
{
    257.24,260.24
     I remember it was like an absolute sin
},
{
    260.24,262.04
     to have a class at like nine o'clock.
},
{
    262.04,263.68
     Like, are you serious?
},
{
    263.68,265.68
     Who gets up at that time?
},
{
    265.68,269.52
     So number two, you definitely want to ease into workouts.
},
{
    269.52,272.48
     And, you know, especially if you're just beginning,
},
{
    272.48,275.24
     but even, you know, if not,
},
{
    275.24,277.92
     when you start trying to ramp up a little bit,
},
{
    277.92,279.92
     you know, you don't want it to go crazy, right?
},
{
    279.92,281.88
     Because you're just gonna get so sore,
},
{
    281.88,283.64
     you're just gonna set yourself back.
},
{
    283.64,286.16
     So lower weights, lower reps to start off with.
},
{
    286.16,287.48
     You know?
},
{
    287.48,289.36
     Especially if you're older, if you're,
},
{
    289.36,291.92
     you know, 50 years and older.
},
{
    291.92,294.98
     Boy, are you really better considered taking your time
},
{
    294.98,297.68
     getting into things so you don't injure yourself.
},
{
    297.68,300.16
     You injure yourself and then you're really set back.
},
{
    300.16,303.32
     Yeah, when you were younger, it was a matter of soreness
},
{
    303.32,304.6
     and now it's a matter of injury.
},
{
    304.6,306.2
     So take it from us.
},
{
    306.2,309.04
     Number three, this really helps a lot,
},
{
    309.04,311.36
     especially if you can do it immediately after the workout,
},
{
    311.36,314.6
     or even say up to one to six hours later,
},
{
    314.6,317.48
     you do foam roller, massage,
},
{
    317.48,320.56
     you can use a softball or a tennis ball.
},
{
    320.56,322.8
     We're gonna show you one today, Brad, here.
},
{
    322.8,324.52
     This is a new unit by Renfo.
},
{
    324.52,326.94
     It's called the R3 Mini Massage Gun.
},
{
    326.94,329.22
     This is the cutest thing.
},
{
    329.22,331.18
     There's, these are very popular now.
},
{
    331.18,332.02
     And you see them all over.
},
{
    332.02,332.86
     Yeah, massage guns.
},
{
    332.86,334.7
     This one's a little less expensive.
},
{
    334.7,336.14
     Very well made, wouldn't you say, Brad?
},
{
    336.14,336.98
     You're the guy.
},
{
    336.98,338.38
     You're the guy that you can tell.
},
{
    338.38,341.22
     So it's even got an air thing that, what's that called?
},
{
    341.22,342.9
     Well, it cools it down.
},
{
    342.9,344.9
     It cools it down with air queen, you're right.
},
{
    344.9,347.24
     So it's got five attachments,
},
{
    347.24,349.8
     and this is the best attachment I've seen so far now.
},
{
    349.8,352.12
     Because this is a nice attachment.
},
{
    352.12,355.08
     It's rubber and it's air filled kind of.
},
{
    355.08,355.92
     Yup, right?
},
{
    355.92,356.76
     It's a little spongy.
},
{
    356.76,357.96
     A little spongy, so it really.
},
{
    357.96,359.92
     It's broad, it doesn't have that pointy,
},
{
    359.92,361.52
     you know, it's nice to get in sometimes,
},
{
    361.52,362.36
     but I would say-
},
{
    362.36,364.14
     I would say, if you want the point too, I can do that.
},
{
    364.14,367.52
     This is the one I would use 80% of the time.
},
{
    367.52,368.36
     I agree.
},
{
    368.36,371.0
     It's one like, they a lot of them have the round ball,
},
{
    371.0,371.84
     which is good.
},
{
    371.84,372.68
     Yeah.
},
{
    372.68,374.08
     But I think this is a step in the, oh,
},
{
    374.08,375.32
     this is like the pre-mall.
},
{
    375.32,377.4
     This one that goes on either side of the spine
},
{
    377.4,378.24
     can work out.
},
{
    378.24,379.28
     I've never used that one.
},
{
    379.28,380.6
     I'm not sure.
},
{
    380.6,383.28
     You know, I can imagine a couple of places I might want it,
},
{
    383.28,384.12
     but-
},
{
    384.12,384.96
     You get you right in the eyes.
},
{
    384.96,385.88
     Oh, why Bob?
},
{
    385.88,386.8
     Why?
},
{
    386.8,388.16
     Okay, go ahead and turn around Brad.
},
{
    388.16,389.0
     Oh yeah, that's a good idea.
},
{
    389.0,389.84
     Stick it on it.
},
{
    389.84,391.6
     And what you're gonna wanna do is,
},
{
    391.6,393.84
     you're gonna wanna massage, this sounds simple,
},
{
    393.84,395.28
     but you wanna massage the muscles
},
{
    395.28,396.76
     that you worked out that day.
},
{
    396.76,398.92
     You don't have to massage your whole body.
},
{
    398.92,401.32
     So let's say you did leg workout.
},
{
    401.32,402.84
     You wanna hit the quads.
},
{
    402.84,405.24
     You wanna hit the hamstrings. you wanna hit the hamstrings,
},
{
    405.24,406.8
     you wanna hit the buttocks.
},
{
    406.8,409.48
     So, you know, and what's nice about these guns,
},
{
    409.48,411.12
     they don't tire out.
},
{
    411.12,413.6
     Your hands are gonna tire out.
},
{
    413.6,417.0
     If you have to use a ball or a foam roller,
},
{
    417.0,419.2
     it gets a little awkward trying to get into all those
},
{
    419.2,420.04
     positions.
},
{
    420.04,421.66
     This thing.
},
{
    421.66,424.88
     Yeah, I really use it for my hip a lot,
},
{
    424.88,426.52
     because it's just so easy to do.
},
{
    426.52,428.88
     I got up and I rode 21 miles on my bike
},
{
    428.88,431.64
     and had four climbs, regressive climbs.
},
{
    431.64,432.48
     You gotta do this.
},
{
    432.48,434.12
     This is feeling really good.
},
{
    434.12,435.88
     My quads are, you know, if you bike a lot,
},
{
    435.88,437.2
     you know when you're climbing,
},
{
    437.2,439.44
     especially when you're staying in a saddle, man.
},
{
    439.44,441.48
     Oh, those quads really get a nice roll.
},
{
    441.48,443.44
     So when will you bike again?
},
{
    443.44,444.82
     Tuesday, two days from now.
},
{
    444.82,446.86
     So yeah, you should be doing this.
},
{
    446.86,448.08
     Yeah, you're right.
},
{
    448.08,449.36
     You know, the roller's good too.
},
{
    449.36,450.2
     I like the roller.
},
{
    450.2,451.04
     The roller's good.
},
{
    451.04,452.16
     This is more fun than the roller.
},
{
    452.16,453.48
     I can tell you that much.
},
{
    453.48,456.2
     So number four was the one that Brad was alluding to
},
{
    456.2,457.42
     is active recovery.
},
{
    457.42,461.98
     So what you wanna do is like the next day,
},
{
    461.98,466.16
     you could do low intensity or even after the workout, you could do a cool down.
},
{
    466.16,468.16
     Do you do a cool down?
},
{
    468.16,471.04
     Usually I try at the end, I'll just not go so hard.
},
{
    471.04,472.12
     You don't do a cool down.
},
{
    472.12,472.96
     Sometimes I do, Bob.
},
{
    472.96,473.8
     You don't.
},
{
    473.8,475.12
     You're just not the cool down person.
},
{
    475.12,475.96
     I always not.
},
{
    475.96,476.92
     Dude, we're like, when I run,
},
{
    476.92,479.24
     I walk 100 yards before I stop.
},
{
    479.24,482.52
     This is our camera when her husband said he saw you
},
{
    482.52,484.4
     and your wife, I think you were canoeing
},
{
    484.4,485.72
     or I don't know if you were on a bike.
},
{
    485.72,489.48
     And he said you were like going a hundred miles an hour.
},
{
    489.48,490.56
     I was chasing my wife,
},
{
    490.56,493.2
     and I was trying to get her to the front of the canoe.
},
{
    493.2,494.04
     I thought I fell.
},
{
    494.04,495.6
     You have one speed.
},
{
    495.6,498.92
     So active recovery, so you're gonna do low intensity use
},
{
    498.92,500.08
     of the same muscle group.
},
{
    500.08,504.28
     So if you're biking, you don't wanna like do some
},
{
    504.28,508.76
     really slow biking, low intensity biking at the end.
},
{
    508.76,511.9
     One thing about active recovery, I took a class on this
},
{
    511.9,514.12
     and you wanna work with your heart rate,
},
{
    514.12,516.68
     but it's like amazing, particularly if you're like me
},
{
    516.68,519.08
     and you have these two speed on and off,
},
{
    519.08,522.08
     it's hard to do it because you have to go so light
},
{
    522.08,524.24
     that it feels like you're not even working on it.
},
{
    524.24,525.8
     Why am I doing this?
},
{
    525.8,529.3
     But just enough to get blood flow, fresh blood
},
{
    529.3,532.4
     to these injured areas without working in re-injuring them.
},
{
    532.4,534.92
     Yeah, and it'll just, you won't get a sore.
},
{
    534.92,537.52
     Like I said, if you did a leg workout,
},
{
    537.52,539.72
     even going on a stationary bike,
},
{
    539.72,542.52
     very, almost no resistance at all,
},
{
    542.52,543.8
     and just getting some movement,
},
{
    543.8,545.8
     it's gonna make a big difference.
},
{
    545.8,549.64
     On number five, it does help diet wise
},
{
    549.64,552.24
     to take in some additional proteins.
},
{
    552.24,556.52
     And it's pretty universal that you take the omega-3s,
},
{
    556.52,560.28
     like fish oil, and water, hydration.
},
{
    560.28,561.52
     You gotta drink a lot of water.
},
{
    561.52,564.96
     You can hardly not drink enough water.
},
{
    564.96,567.16
     I was teaching a class once in a cycle, and I was telling the class, drink as of water before you recovery. You can hardly not drink enough water. I was teaching a class once in a cycling night,
},
{
    567.16,569.08
     telling the class, drink as much water as you want,
},
{
    569.08,570.48
     you can't drink enough water.
},
{
    570.48,571.68
     One of these guys in the back,
},
{
    571.68,574.28
     but that's not true, you can over drink water,
},
{
    574.28,577.08
     which is true if you force yourself to drink so much water,
},
{
    577.08,578.52
     you get reverse osmosis.
},
{
    578.52,580.64
     But if you're listening to your body, you probably get it.
},
{
    580.64,582.72
     Yeah, I mean, reasonably if you drink.
},
{
    582.72,584.8
     It's more than most people do, that's for sure.
},
{
    584.8,586.6
     Right, so these are the three
},
{
    586.6,588.48
     that we're not that thrilled with.
},
{
    588.48,592.56
     They're not terrible to do, but just static stretching.
},
{
    592.56,594.36
     Research just doesn't support it.
},
{
    594.36,598.08
     That the static stretching after a workout,
},
{
    598.08,601.64
     it doesn't help muscle recovery.
},
{
    601.64,603.16
     Oh, for the recovery part?
},
{
    603.16,604.0
     Yeah.
},
{
    604.0,606.02
     Yeah, that is, and I kind of think
},
{
    606.02,608.0
     that's gonna go back and forth over the years.
},
{
    608.0,608.84
     Yeah, am I?
},
{
    608.84,610.98
     As far as flexibility, maybe for different...
},
{
    610.98,613.22
     Flexibility's good, but I'm saying muscle recovery.
},
{
    613.22,615.26
     Okay, right, so there's always...
},
{
    615.26,617.08
     Number two, ice baths.
},
{
    617.08,620.28
     Now, they can help with the inflammation they said,
},
{
    620.28,622.92
     but it can hinder your muscle growth and strength
},
{
    622.92,624.32
     according to the studies.
},
{
    624.32,626.92
     So of course they're not fun to take either.
},
{
    626.92,627.76
     I mean.
},
{
    627.76,630.12
     But there's, what was it, what was a football player?
},
{
    630.12,632.96
     I guess Reggie White, after a football game,
},
{
    632.96,633.96
     he would,
},
{
    633.96,635.4
     So Reggie White is a baseball player?
},
{
    635.4,636.4
     You get it.
},
{
    636.4,639.12
     Yeah, the Packer guy.
},
{
    639.12,639.96
     Oh, he's a Packer guy?
},
{
    639.96,640.88
     I don't know.
},
{
    640.88,641.72
     No, he would.
},
{
    641.72,642.72
     And that's what I think.
},
{
    642.72,644.32
     Yeah, a lot of them do that.
},
{
    644.32,646.26
     Ice water, and it's like. Right. And I've seen them, where would. And that's what I think. I remember a lot of them do that. Ice water and it's like.
},
{
    646.26,647.1
     Right.
},
{
    647.1,649.44
     And I've seen them where they get on right up to their neck.
},
{
    649.44,650.28
     Yeah.
},
{
    650.28,651.92
     And so, you know, they're professionals.
},
{
    651.92,653.72
     They do what they need to do, I guess.
},
{
    653.72,656.08
     Number three, there's a lot of talk about caffeine
},
{
    656.08,659.56
     and they actually found that it does help with muscle recovery.
},
{
    659.56,660.4
     Really?
},
{
    660.4,663.12
     You do like three or four cups before you work out though.
},
{
    663.12,663.96
     What?
},
{
    663.96,664.96
     Three or four cups of coffee.
},
{
    664.96,665.84
     So it's a lot.
},
{
    665.84,667.32
     And that's what the negative part is.
},
{
    667.32,668.16
     That's what I would never.
},
{
    668.16,669.0
     Well you have to go pee all the time then.
},
{
    669.0,669.92
     Well you gotta pee all the time.
},
{
    669.92,672.08
     And also it wouldn't be good if you did a workout
},
{
    672.08,673.8
     in the afternoon or night.
},
{
    673.8,676.2
     I mean, I'm not that, to be honest with you Brad,
},
{
    676.2,678.2
     I'm just not that big a fan of caffeine.
},
{
    678.2,680.28
     I've taken caffeine out of my life.
},
{
    680.28,681.12
     Yeah.
},
{
    681.12,681.96
     I just, I wouldn't.
},
{
    681.96,684.92
     Well you never drank much, or type, type?
},
{
    684.92,687.36
     I drank, yeah I drank, I never't. Well, you never drank much, or type, type? I drank, yeah, I drank, I never drank coffee.
},
{
    687.36,688.2
     Right.
},
{
    688.2,690.32
     But I, you know, I did have it in other forms,
},
{
    690.32,691.24
     you know, through pop and stuff.
},
{
    691.24,692.48
     You don't have to tell us Bob.
},
{
    692.48,693.64
     Okay.
},
{
    693.64,695.0
     I mainlined it.
},
{
    695.0,698.44
     So, all right, remember Brad and I can fix just about anything.
},
{
    698.44,699.52
     Except for.
},
{
    699.52,700.36
     A broken heart.
},
{
    700.36,702.0
     But we're working on that too.
},
{
    702.0,703.36
     Yeah, I feel like we're not working on it.
},
{
    703.36,704.6
     Well, this is related to that,
},
{
    704.6,706.12
     because this is a muscle recovery. So the broken heart is like a muscle. we're not working on it. Well, this is related to that, because this is muscle recovery,
},
{
    706.12,708.04
     so the broken heart is like a muscle.
},
{
    708.04,708.88
     We're gonna get it.
},
{
    708.88,709.72
     You always think it's related.
},
{
    709.72,711.32
     Yeah, maybe we can do an active recovery.
},
{
    711.32,None
     All right, thanks for watching. you
},
