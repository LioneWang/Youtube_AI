{
    0.0,7.2
     So we're going to talk today about the Stop the Bleed program and specifically bleeding
},
{
    7.2,9.28
     control techniques.
},
{
    9.28,14.72
     One of the things that we've learned as first responders, paramedics, firefighters, police
},
{
    14.72,19.36
     officers is that the people who are going to have the greatest impact and make the biggest
},
{
    19.36,24.24
     difference in a severe bleeding situation are really just the people who are around.
},
{
    24.24,26.88
     You can bleed to death from severe bleeding
},
{
    26.88,29.52
     in as little as three to five minutes.
},
{
    29.52,34.42
     Being able to use these tools to be able to stop the bleed
},
{
    34.42,35.92
     is really, really important.
},
{
    35.92,37.96
     So that's why we're here today.
},
{
    37.96,41.12
     So the, first of all, recognizing severe bleeding
},
{
    41.12,43.0
     and understanding what severe bleeding looks like
},
{
    43.0,43.88
     is really important.
},
{
    43.88,48.0
     So if you have a large wound where you have bleeding that is spurting out of the wound,
},
{
    48.0,52.0
     that's fairly obvious as severe bleeding and life-threatening bleeding as well.
},
{
    52.0,58.0
     So if you have something that's spurting, that's something that you need to intervene with immediately.
},
{
    58.0,65.84
     If you have blood that just won't stop coming out of the wound, that's also severe and needs to be treated as well. Anytime that
},
{
    65.84,69.72
     you have clothing that's soaked in blood, that would be considered severe bleeding or
},
{
    69.72,73.6
     pooling on the ground. Pooling of blood on the ground would be severe bleeding as well.
},
{
    73.6,77.36
     So recognizing those things is the first step and then intervening is the second. If we're
},
{
    77.36,82.8
     talking about an extremity, the best way to deal with that is one of these tourniquets.
},
{
    82.8,86.34
     And you know, these are military grade, military style tourniquets
},
{
    86.34,89.98
     that are adapted for civilian use.
},
{
    89.98,94.98
     They are the science and technology behind these.
},
{
    95.8,97.2
     It's not like the tourniquets that you learn,
},
{
    97.2,98.56
     maybe in the Boy Scouts.
},
{
    98.56,101.2
     There's a little bit more data behind these
},
{
    101.2,102.64
     to show that they actually do work
},
{
    102.64,104.72
     and they actually do control bleeding.
},
{
    104.72,109.54
     So we wanna stay away from any sort of improvised tourniquets and only use these specified tourniquets
},
{
    109.94,113.58
     if you're going to use these to stop bleeding.
},
{
    114.4,117.1
     The first thing that we're going to do is we're going to just open this up
},
{
    117.1,119.5
     and if you're applying a tourniquet to yourself,
},
{
    119.68,125.44
     the application process is fairly simple and all you're really going to do is put this on high
},
{
    125.44,128.8
     and you're going to put it on tight and you're going to just pull this strap here.
},
{
    129.76,133.68
     You're going to pull this thing around and then once I've got that nice and tight,
},
{
    135.2,139.76
     I'm just going to turn this windlass here a couple of times. I've got that a little low
},
{
    140.88,143.36
     so I'll flip it up just a little bit there.
},
{
    146.4,150.56
     So I'll flip it up just a little bit there. And you want to get this at least two to three inches above wherever the wound side is, but
},
{
    150.56,154.88
     we like to practice just high and tight because the higher you get this, the more bleeding
},
{
    154.88,156.24
     that you're going to stop.
},
{
    156.24,161.58
     And we don't want to confuse people too much with where to go, just above the site and
},
{
    161.58,164.0
     high and tight is what we want to tell people.
},
{
    164.0,167.28
     And then you're going to turn this windlass until bleeding stops.
},
{
    167.28,171.16
     And then once we have bleeding controlled, then we're going to go ahead and thread this
},
{
    171.16,174.76
     through and it's really, really a simple process, especially if you're putting it on somebody
},
{
    174.76,178.2
     else and you have two hands to work with.
},
{
    178.2,182.24
     There are a little bit painful and we've had people say that the tourniquet ends up hurting
},
{
    182.24,185.04
     a little bit worse than the wound sometimes,
},
{
    185.04,186.04
     but it's life-over-limit.
},
{
    186.04,190.6
     It will help save your life in these situations where we have severe bleeding.
},
{
    190.6,196.4
     If you don't have one of these very specific tourniquets, and you know, we're hoping that
},
{
    196.4,201.4
     there does come a time where these are readily accessible in public places and malls and
},
{
    201.4,205.44
     in shopping centers and things like that, you know, we're getting to that point
},
{
    205.44,207.16
     where you may see these in more places
},
{
    207.16,210.24
     and you may be able to respond and help somebody out
},
{
    210.24,211.68
     and use one of these tourniquets,
},
{
    211.68,215.04
     or maybe you'll carry one of these yourself at some point.
},
{
    215.04,217.32
     But we're not quite there yet and we recognize that.
},
{
    217.32,221.08
     So if you don't have one of these specified tourniquets,
},
{
    221.08,223.6
     the combat application tourniquet specifically
},
{
    223.6,224.52
     is what we recommend.
},
{
    224.52,226.04
     If you don't have one of these,
},
{
    226.04,228.56
     then what we do recommend is wound packing.
},
{
    228.56,231.76
     And so when you have a large vessel wound,
},
{
    231.76,234.32
     if you have a large extremity wound,
},
{
    234.32,237.16
     or a large wound to the neck or the groin,
},
{
    237.16,239.12
     that is severely bleeding,
},
{
    239.12,240.64
     what we want you to do is we want you
},
{
    240.64,242.48
     to apply pressure to that wound.
},
{
    242.48,245.88
     And you can do this so if you have some sort of addressing
},
{
    245.88,247.96
     in a trauma kit or something like that, great.
},
{
    247.96,249.24
     We would assume if you had a trauma kit,
},
{
    249.24,251.28
     you would also have dressing.
},
{
    251.28,255.54
     In the situation where you don't have a trauma tourniquet,
},
{
    255.54,258.72
     we would say don't apply a makeshift tourniquet,
},
{
    258.72,263.48
     belts and things like this, lanyards and other devices,
},
{
    263.48,268.28
     they're sometimes not strong enough to apply the necessary pressure.
},
{
    268.28,272.56
     And the trauma surgeons are finding that they can actually cause more damage or more harm
},
{
    272.56,276.84
     in some of the situations by adding more pressure to the wound.
},
{
    276.84,281.2
     And so we would say stay away from makeshift tourniquets and go straight to wound packing
},
{
    281.2,282.84
     and direct pressure.
},
{
    282.84,286.2
     And so when we're talking about wound packing,
},
{
    286.2,287.6
     you know, I have gauze here,
},
{
    287.6,289.0
     but really you can use anything.
},
{
    289.0,291.04
     You can use socks, you can use your shirt,
},
{
    291.04,292.9
     you can use any sort of absorbent material
},
{
    292.9,294.34
     that you can find in a situation
},
{
    294.34,295.98
     where you have somebody bleeding.
},
{
    295.98,297.94
     And I would say don't worry necessarily
},
{
    297.94,300.82
     about if it's really, really dirty.
},
{
    300.82,304.18
     You know, the person is going to get antibiotics
},
{
    304.18,307.16
     and the trauma surgeons would much rather you get them
},
{
    307.16,310.32
     there alive with their blood volume intact,
},
{
    310.32,312.6
     rather than worry about getting some dirt into a wound.
},
{
    312.6,315.32
     So don't worry about that too much.
},
{
    315.32,316.92
     I'm gonna just spread this just a little bit
},
{
    316.92,319.32
     to show basically what we're going for
},
{
    319.32,320.52
     when you're doing the wound packing.
},
{
    320.52,323.52
     You would do a quick wipe just to see
},
{
    323.52,330.16
     if you can see where the bleeding is coming from. And then're just going to put the wound, the material down in there and I'm
},
{
    330.16,334.24
     demonstrating this with one hand and of course with no gloves but in a situation where you
},
{
    334.24,338.0
     were helping somebody you would want to have gloves on if you can, if not then that's,
},
{
    338.0,340.72
     you know, you're going to have to judge that for yourself whether you want to get involved
},
{
    340.72,341.72
     in that situation.
},
{
    341.72,344.88
     I can tell you from my personal experience if I have somebody who's bleeding and I'm
},
{
    344.88,346.12
     off duty, I'm more likely who's bleeding and I'm off duty,
},
{
    346.12,348.56
     I'm more likely to help them than I'm not.
},
{
    348.56,351.04
     And so you're just basically gonna keep pushing
},
{
    351.04,353.64
     this material down in there, whatever the material is,
},
{
    353.64,355.16
     until you feel like you've got that down
},
{
    355.16,357.12
     to the bottom of the wound, you've filled up the wound,
},
{
    357.12,358.88
     and then you're gonna hold pressure.
},
{
    358.88,360.48
     And you're gonna hold that pressure
},
{
    360.48,362.88
     until the paramedics arrive and they're able
},
{
    362.88,368.96
     to either apply a tourniquet or take that pressure over for you. Don't peek at it to see if it stopped bleeding. That
},
{
    368.96,372.48
     will stop the clotting process and just hold that thing down and you can really
},
{
    372.48,377.12
     have a huge impact here just by applying pressure to a wound to stop bleeding
},
{
    377.12,380.6
     and hopefully save a life. You know we've gone over some of the basics of
},
{
    380.6,383.24
     bleeding control. We've talked about some tourniquets and tourniquet
},
{
    383.24,389.72
     application. We've talked about some wound packing and direct pressure. And really, you know, this
},
{
    389.72,395.24
     is the first steps into learning more about the Stop the Bleed program and taking a Bleeding
},
{
    395.24,401.88
     Control course. And I would really recommend that everybody take a Stop the Bleed course.
},
{
    401.88,405.28
     And so, you know, it's about an hour long course. It takes you through
},
{
    405.76,413.28
     recognizing that severe bleeding and it gives you the confidence to be able to intervene when you see somebody who's in a situation
},
{
    413.96,418.12
     where there's serious severe bleeding and they're at risk for disability or death.
},
{
    418.28,422.18
     So I would really recommend somebody go and take this course.
},
{
    422.96,425.24
     For the folks that are interested in buying
},
{
    425.24,430.8
     these tourniquets you can go to North American Rescue and that's narescue.com.
},
{
    430.8,436.26
     That's where the paramedics in the city here buy their tourniquets from,
},
{
    436.26,440.12
     the police officers and everybody else, that's where we supply from. So that would
},
{
    440.12,446.72
     be our recommendation is to use a certified company that sells these.
},
{
    446.72,451.96
     And then as far as bleeding control kits, they have kits that have actual clotting gauze
},
{
    451.96,454.04
     in there and everything else.
},
{
    454.04,455.44
     So that would be our recommendations.
},
{
    455.44,459.6
     Take a bleeding control class and maybe supply yourself with some of the stuff and certainly
},
{
    459.6,463.48
     be able to intervene when you see somebody who's in trouble.
},
