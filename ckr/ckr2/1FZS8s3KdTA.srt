     Most of my patients diagnosed with silicosis can link back chronic lung disease back to an exposure that they had at work.

     they had at work. Silica is a form of quartz that is found naturally

     Exposure to fine silica is a serious threat

     Exposure to silica can lead to silicosis, a type of pulmonary fibrosis characterized

     As the disease progresses, symptoms can get more serious.

     Silicosis can be progressive, disabling, and sometimes fatal.

    94.48,96.08
     To protect your lung health,
},

     you and your colleagues must use engineered controls,
