    6.8,11.96
     you are here. So many people have been getting a hold of me and asking about this, the Pro

     Lordotic Neck Exerciser. There's a link below to get one for yourself. If not, go with a
},
{
    17.72,21.96
     towel or a belt. Either way, we're going to be doing this a little bit later. But in
},
{
    21.96,26.2
     the meantime, I'm so glad you're here. You know, you've gone to different healthcare providers,
},
{
    26.2,27.84
     you've tried on your neck,
},
{
    27.84,31.2
     but now you're taking your responsibility,
},
{
    31.2,33.96
     the responsibility of your neck into your own hands.
},
{
    33.96,37.04
     Self-care is healthcare and you're doing it.
},
{
    37.04,38.2
     I'm proud of you.
},
{
    38.2,39.76
     Let's do some next circles.
},
{
    39.76,41.0
     Go ahead and just bring it.
},
{
    41.0,43.28
     Hopefully this day, keep circling.
},
{
    43.28,45.0
     Let's go ahead.
},
{
    45.0,49.24
     Hopefully this day your circles are getting bigger
},
{
    49.24,54.24
     and less painful and you're feeling the edges
},
{
    54.24,57.92
     of that range of motion and they're not bothering you.
},
{
    60.84,63.06
     But if they still are, hey, this is a journey.
},
{
    63.06,64.28
     This takes some time.
},
{
    64.28,65.16
     It's okay. Some people say, hey, this is a journey. This takes some time. It's okay.
},
{
    65.16,70.14
     Some people say, hey, I've been doing this video for three months and wow, I have
},
{
    70.14,74.58
     great results. Other people like, wow, I did it twice and life is better. So it's
},
{
    74.58,79.96
     okay. Whatever your body needs. Let's go ahead in the other direction.
},
{
    81.8,92.26
     Oh, loving it. Draw that big circle with your nose, with your chin, with that smiling face of yours.
},
{
    92.26,94.94
     If you were an emoji, what would you look like right now?
},
{
    94.94,96.18
     Let's make it a happy one.
},
{
    96.18,99.82
     Let's make a big white teeth and just, ooh, life is good.
},
{
    99.82,101.14
     Okay, let's go.
},
{
    101.14,107.2
     We're going to take your left hand, put it on your head and pull your ear to your shoulder.
},
{
    107.2,109.28
     I'm doing the mirror image of what you're doing.
},
{
    109.28,112.52
     And now I want you to take that right arm,
},
{
    112.52,116.24
     extend the wrist back, pushing it out to the side.
},
{
    116.24,117.16
     And while you're doing this,
},
{
    117.16,119.02
     you're gonna feel a little tension in that bicep.
},
{
    119.02,120.92
     Go ahead and draw circles backwards.
},
{
    122.08,128.54
     Just as floating up, shoulders are pulling down, the neck is long, and doing
},
{
    128.54,134.14
     those circles. You'll feel that in your hand maybe, your biceps. Let's go in the other
},
{
    134.14,148.8
     direction. It'll just feeling it. Good. Okay, go ahead and just put that arm down, let it relax, pull the ear a little bit more
},
{
    148.8,149.8
     over.
},
{
    149.8,154.96
     Now we're going to do those active resistive stretching or proprioceptive neuromuscular
},
{
    154.96,157.12
     facilitation if you like big words.
},
{
    157.12,162.52
     Go ahead and just take your right ear and just push it towards your right shoulder.
},
{
    162.52,170.2
     But don't let it go in that direction. Okay, and let it release and pull that ear further down towards your shoulder.
},
{
    170.2,172.36
     Good, and push it up again with your head.
},
{
    172.36,173.56
     Push your head, push your head.
},
{
    173.56,175.6
     If this is hurting, just let it relax.
},
{
    175.6,177.2
     Don't go quite as hard.
},
{
    177.2,180.2
     Let it relax completely now and pull, pull, pull, pull.
},
{
    180.2,182.0
     Okay, let's go ahead and do the other side.
},
{
    182.0,186.12
     So now take your right hand and just move that neck around a little
},
{
    186.12,188.36
     Maybe it's tough to get to the other side. That's okay
},
{
    188.36,192.16
     And just pull that ear to the shoulder gently initially
},
{
    192.8,194.64
     Extend that wrist back
},
{
    194.64,199.92
     Push that palm out to the side pull the shoulder down. Let's do some circles backwards
},
{
    200.6,202.96
     Good the chest is up the shoulders are
},
{
    203.88,208.56
     Making room for the ears. Let's go ahead
},
{
    208.56,213.68
     in the other direction. Feeling that nice stretch. Maybe in the biceps, maybe in the
},
{
    213.68,223.56
     fingers, or maybe not. Okay, we're going to go ahead and again pull the ear to the
},
{
    223.56,226.24
     shoulder and now give some resistance
},
{
    226.24,227.24
     here.
},
{
    227.24,232.56
     Take your left ear and push it, push it, push it towards your left shoulder and then let
},
{
    232.56,233.56
     it relax.
},
{
    233.56,234.56
     Good.
},
{
    234.56,237.56
     Oh, I feel so good.
},
{
    237.56,238.56
     Oh.
},
{
    238.56,239.56
     Good.
},
{
    239.56,244.04
     Push, push, push, push, push.
},
{
    244.04,245.0
     And let it relax. Push, push, push, push, push. And let it relax.
},
{
    247.48,249.32
     Push, push, push.
},
{
    249.32,250.16
     And let it relax.
},
{
    250.16,252.92
     Ooh, look how far that range of motion can go.
},
{
    252.92,255.48
     Okay, carefully bring your head back.
},
{
    255.48,257.6
     I'm gonna provide a little resistance for your head.
},
{
    257.6,259.72
     Put your fingers behind your neck.
},
{
    259.72,261.68
     If you can interlace them, that's great.
},
{
    261.68,266.12
     Push that head back, and then bring it forward. You're giving
},
{
    266.12,272.2
     it resistance the whole time. You're flexing and extending your head while your hands are
},
{
    272.2,284.16
     pushing your head. It's sort of a motion with resistance. Motion with resistance. Love it.
},
{
    284.16,286.64
     Try and see if you can look all the way up. Notice that
},
{
    286.64,292.64
     chest is opening up a little bit. All that texting you do, all that computer you do,
},
{
    292.64,298.24
     it shortens those pec minor muscles and so we're going to open them up a little bit and stretch
},
{
    298.24,302.64
     them a little bit. Okay, let's go ahead and pull it all the way forward and get a nice stretch.
},
{
    302.64,305.48
     Good.
},
{
    305.48,307.88
     Feel the stretch in that upper thoracic spine.
},
{
    307.88,310.44
     Even those suboccipitals tuck that chin a little bit.
},
{
    310.44,312.56
     If you like, bring those elbows together.
},
{
    312.56,314.48
     You'll get a little more stretch.
},
{
    314.48,318.36
     Just open up those wings that you have.
},
{
    318.36,319.96
     Speaking of those wings, let's stretch them out.
},
{
    319.96,324.2
     We're going to bring your knuckles together, curl the shoulders forward and stretch those
},
{
    324.2,327.64
     wings out. And then we're going to do some vertical rows here.
},
{
    327.64,331.82
     Pull it back, those elbows come back, chest is up and pinch the shoulder blades.
},
{
    331.82,337.32
     Taking those scapula and bring it forward into their full range of motion, at least
},
{
    337.32,341.68
     in protraction and retraction.
},
{
    341.68,345.0
     Curl it forward, bring it back, chest is up, big smile.
},
{
    345.0,350.0
     Alright, and then forward, and then back, good.
},
{
    350.0,352.0
     Oh, I'm loving it. Let's go a little faster.
},
{
    352.0,356.0
     Curling forward, bring it back.
},
{
    356.0,359.0
     Curl it forward, bring it back.
},
{
    359.0,362.0
     Yes, pump some fluid into that area.
},
{
    362.0,364.0
     Get those rhomboids stretched out.
},
{
    364.0,370.92
     Get those ribs moving. When the ribs moving, people have less anxiety. There's more room for that
},
{
    370.92,375.88
     lungs, for those lungs to just fill up. Good, keep going. Good, we're gonna do a
},
{
    375.88,379.88
     little massage. I love this massage. I'm excited about sharing it with you. So go
},
{
    379.88,386.28
     ahead, take your right hand, put it right around your suboccipitals. Take your left fingertips
},
{
    386.28,391.72
     so that they meet the right fingertips and then push them in hard. I mean hard. Go for
},
{
    391.72,398.08
     it and then pull them apart so your right hands go up your scalp, up into your skull.
},
{
    398.08,406.16
     Your left hand goes down your neck. Good. And let's meet them together and open that whole joint right there. Good.
},
{
    406.16,411.72
     This is like squeezing a tube of toothpaste, just really opening up the suboccipital, going
},
{
    411.72,414.28
     down into your neck.
},
{
    414.28,416.8
     Good.
},
{
    416.8,423.04
     Meet them together and pull them apart.
},
{
    423.04,424.4
     Meet them together, pull them apart.
},
{
    424.4,425.98
     Let's go to the other side. Take the left hand,
},
{
    425.98,430.84
     put it up right where the psoxibles are, the right hand to meet the left at the fingertips,
},
{
    430.84,450.68
     and pull apart. Feel even a pulling of the hair. It's okay, just pull it apart. Mmm, that's just glorious. Your neck should be singing right now. Just loving it. Oh, that
},
{
    450.68,467.96
     feels good. Just enjoy it. You're grooming yourself like a cat, just taking care of itself. Opening them on up. Open up that suboccipital.
},
{
    467.96,474.08
     Beautiful. Let's use that a little bit and let's just do the chin tuck just like
},
{
    474.08,479.56
     this. Oh, feel how easy that goes. Let's do some lateral flexions with the chin tuck.
},
{
    479.56,485.92
     Palms are facing straight ahead, neck is long, as you sort of bring that head back
},
{
    485.92,491.32
     and forth, make it long at the same time. Like somebody is just pulling it up as
},
{
    491.32,497.12
     you're laterally flexing it. Good. Now we're gonna open up the suboccipitals a
},
{
    497.12,501.32
     little bit different way. So we're gonna do like a king tut. This is gonna be a
},
{
    501.32,509.34
     little challenging for you. It's a range of motion that usually we don't go into. So bring the hands together right under
},
{
    509.34,513.5
     the chin. Okay and just bring that head over like this. You're going to feel that
},
{
    513.5,518.38
     suboccipital open up on the side that you're going to and bring it to the other
},
{
    518.38,522.38
     side. Good. Keep the head level, the eyes level. This might be a little
},
{
    522.38,525.4
     neurologically challenging for you but just give it your best shot
},
{
    525.4,527.08
     let your mental energy go towards it
},
{
    527.08,530.16
     opening it up opening it up oh that
},
{
    530.16,537.36
     feels good oh yeah it's kind of a
},
{
    537.36,540.0
     Michael Jackson move kind of there we
},
{
    540.0,547.2
     go opening it up side to side good job job. Let's grab that pro-lordotic neck
},
{
    547.2,553.98
     exercise. We love it. It's so good. Okay, it's gonna go right behind your neck or
},
{
    553.98,559.38
     your towel or your belt, whatever you got. Push the handles out, pull the shoulders
},
{
    559.38,567.0
     down, and let's go ahead and start with the hands low and bring it back and bring it forward
},
{
    567.0,568.5
     bring it back
},
{
    568.5,570.5
     forward good
},
{
    570.5,572.5
     let's
},
{
    572.5,575.5
     tuck that chin don't just lurch it forward
},
{
    575.5,577.5
     tuck that chin forward
},
{
    577.5,580.5
     and move the hands up just a little bit
},
{
    581.5,583.5
     and back and forward
},
{
    583.5,587.36
     you're getting that neck curve. We actually have a neck
},
{
    587.36,593.52
     curve in the womb. We have a lordotic neck curve in the womb and then we lose
},
{
    593.52,599.2
     it and it puts tension on that cord. Let's go ahead and bring the hands up and
},
{
    599.2,603.28
     when we lose the curve the weight goes more onto the discs and then they can
},
{
    603.28,607.66
     degenerate. We don't want those discs degenerate right now.
},
{
    607.66,610.86
     We're pushing into the discs and getting them hydrated.
},
{
    610.86,615.6
     They don't have a good blood supply after the age of 12, so they need to be hydrated
},
{
    615.6,616.6
     with movement.
},
{
    616.6,619.44
     Now, let's go ahead and do a couple of sidewards movements.
},
{
    619.44,625.12
     Just go ahead and bring the hands right out in front of you and just go side to side just like this.
},
{
    629.4,639.68
     Good. That feels so good. Great. You're doing wonderful. How does it feel to be
},
{
    639.68,643.86
     moving in the right direction? Every day you are moving in the right
},
{
    643.86,647.44
     direction feeling better, getting more range of motion, even if you don't feel better. If
},
{
    647.44,651.88
     you're getting more range of motion, you're going in the right direction. Thanks
},
{
    651.88,656.12
     for being here. See you in day seven.
},
