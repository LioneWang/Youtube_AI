     Hi everybody, I'm Steve with USCCA Training.
},
{
    3.76,8.4
     I'm here with my good friend Anthony Lambert, USCCA Training Counselor and owner of ACT
},
{
    8.4,9.4
     Gun Training.
},
{
    9.4,13.76
     Anthony is joining us here today so that he can help teach us how we may be able to save
},
{
    13.76,14.76
     lives.
},
{
    14.76,17.96
     Anthony, as a Chief Navy Corpsman, you've saved many lives.
},
{
    17.96,21.48
     So I feel so confident and so fortunate that you're here to help us out.
},
{
    21.48,23.32
     Why don't you teach us one of those methods?
},
{
    23.32,24.32
     Alright.
},
{
    24.32,26.24
     So today what I did, Steve,
},
{
    26.24,28.08
     is I brought a trinicate here with me.
},
{
    28.08,31.24
     It's a soft tea trinicate.
},
{
    31.24,33.08
     And there's a lot of different brands out there
},
{
    33.08,33.92
     on the market.
},
{
    33.92,37.56
     And your particular model may be a little bit different,
},
{
    37.56,40.68
     but essentially any trinicate is designed
},
{
    40.68,42.8
     to restrict the flow of blood.
},
{
    42.8,44.28
     Okay, and why would that be important?
},
{
    44.28,46.44
     Well, the number one reason that people die
},
{
    46.44,49.36
     in a combat situation or, you know,
},
{
    49.36,52.36
     let's say in a gunfight is due to blood loss,
},
{
    52.36,53.34
     major blood loss.
},
{
    53.34,55.72
     So this tool right here, when you receive it,
},
{
    55.72,57.68
     one thing I would highly recommend everyone doing
},
{
    57.68,58.92
     is check out your equipment,
},
{
    58.92,61.04
     make sure everything's all there.
},
{
    61.04,65.06
     And typically these trinocates come all the way closed.
},
{
    67.86,69.18
     Now imagine if you're the one injured and you have to put this on yourself. It's gonna be pretty hard to open that up.
},
{
    69.18,72.76
     Right. So what I recommend for everybody out there is when you get your
},
{
    72.76,76.94
     trinicates, open that strap all the way open and then refold it.
},
{
    77.52,80.72
     So it makes sense for you so you can be able to put it on yourself,
},
{
    80.8,84.8
     tighten it down and wind it up. Okay. So can I, uh,
},
{
    87.4,88.88
     demonstrate to our viewers out there on you on how to use this?
},
{
    88.88,89.72
     Absolutely, absolutely.
},
{
    89.72,92.96
     All right, on the soft tee trinicate,
},
{
    92.96,94.32
     all you gotta do is we're gonna simulate
},
{
    94.32,97.04
     that you have a severed left arm.
},
{
    97.04,97.88
     Okay.
},
{
    97.88,100.52
     Now one key thing with the trinicate is you wanna go
},
{
    100.52,102.2
     at least four inches above the wound.
},
{
    102.2,105.88
     So we'll just say that you severed your arm here
},
{
    105.88,109.08
     or you have major bleeding right from your forearm here.
},
{
    109.08,113.2
     So we want to go above the joint, never ever on the joint.
},
{
    113.2,115.36
     And then what we want to do is we want to tighten down
},
{
    115.36,118.88
     the strap as tight as possible.
},
{
    118.88,120.8
     Now, since we're doing this for training purposes,
},
{
    120.8,122.6
     I'm not going to tighten it down so hard that actually
},
{
    122.6,124.32
     restrict the flow of blood.
},
{
    124.32,126.16
     But let me know when you start feeling it.
},
{
    126.16,127.72
     Okay, and this is the windless type.
},
{
    127.72,129.36
     So you're gonna just take this,
},
{
    129.36,131.6
     you're gonna turn it, continue turning.
},
{
    132.72,133.56
     All right.
},
{
    133.56,134.64
     It's two turns and it feels like
},
{
    134.64,135.88
     I'm getting my blood pressure taken so far.
},
{
    135.88,137.6
     Okay, so we'll stop right there,
},
{
    137.6,139.32
     but in real life situation,
},
{
    139.32,140.92
     you wanna cut it all the way off.
},
{
    140.92,141.76
     Okay.
},
{
    141.76,144.64
     And then you're gonna take this ring right here
},
{
    144.64,148.4
     and just hook it to the end so it holds by itself. That's it. Okay. Now a couple of key things
},
{
    148.4,153.68
     you want to look at after you apply the Trenk kit is one, check for a distal pulse. Okay.
},
{
    153.68,157.92
     Make sure there is no pulse. There's an absence of a pulse. Okay. And also you can do what's
},
{
    157.92,161.96
     called a cap refill. All you got to do is look at the nail bed, squeeze the nail bed. And
},
{
    161.96,166.96
     if it doesn't refill with blood, you know you've got complete restriction of that blood flow.
},
{
    166.96,169.56
     Okay, so checking for the pulse
},
{
    169.56,171.68
     and checking for a capillary refill,
},
{
    171.68,173.32
     tells us that you've got it on tight enough,
},
{
    173.32,174.92
     or if you have to turn it a little bit tighter.
},
{
    174.92,176.84
     Correct, now once you've applied a trinicate,
},
{
    176.84,178.44
     never remove it, okay?
},
{
    178.44,180.1
     And if the patient is unconscious,
},
{
    180.1,182.0
     you definitely want to mark their forehead
},
{
    182.0,184.74
     with either a Sharpie pen or maybe even with their own blood.
},
{
    184.74,185.92
     Mark a T on their forehead.
},
{
    185.92,189.72
     That way, once they get into the emergency room, the emergency room staff know that there's
},
{
    189.72,191.12
     a trinicate on you somewhere.
},
{
    191.12,195.28
     And the other key thing that the viewers must remember is you can only apply a trinicate
},
{
    195.28,196.76
     on an extremity.
},
{
    196.76,200.8
     Never anywhere near the central mass of the body.
},
{
    200.8,201.8
     Right.
},
{
    201.8,202.8
     Okay.
},
{
    202.8,205.68
     You talked about that there was a severed arm, but what if it's an arterial bleed?
},
{
    205.68,206.68
     Same thing.
},
{
    206.68,207.68
     You still want a turnic.
},
{
    207.68,211.6
     Arterial bleed and the way you can tell, the difference between arterial bleed or a
},
{
    211.6,215.36
     venous bleed is it's going to be bright red blood and it's going to be spurting with
},
{
    215.36,216.36
     the heartbeat.
},
{
    216.36,217.36
     Okay.
},
{
    217.36,218.36
     Okay.
},
{
    218.36,222.08
     And also, even if it's a deep vein bleed, you're going to get massive bleeding, so you
},
{
    222.08,223.8
     definitely want to throw a turnic on there.
},
{
    223.8,224.8
     First thing.
},
{
    224.8,225.88
     First thing. Gotcha. Save time. Save time, save lives, right? That's right. You're gonna get massive bleeding so you definitely want to throw a trinicant on there first thing first thing got you save time
},
{
    226.4,228.44
     Save time save lives right that's right
},
{
    228.44,234.26
     I mean I have iFax in my home individual first-aid kits in my home in different areas in the home in all of my vehicles
},
{
    234.26,236.26
     I got one in my desk drawer at work
},
{
    236.28,238.4
     Any other recommendations as far as that is concerned?
},
{
    238.4,242.4
     I would recommend actually having one on your persons because you're not gonna always gonna be at home
},
{
    242.4,244.4
     You're not gonna always be in your vehicle
},
{
    244.4,249.0
     You could be at the shopping mall and it could be that you need it or one of your loved ones needs it.
},
{
    249.0,251.0
     And you can get them small enough that they can actually fit in your pocket.
},
{
    251.0,252.0
     Absolutely, yeah.
},
{
    252.0,257.0
