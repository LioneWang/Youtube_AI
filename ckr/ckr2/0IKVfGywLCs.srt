     Hello, Leon here from BackIntelligence.com where we help people fix their posture and manage their back pain from home.
},
{
    7.0,13.0
     And today I wanted to talk to you about how you can get out of a stiff, tight neck.
},
{
    13.0,20.0
     So if you have a lot of pain or tightness in your neck area right now or you can't even move your head side to side,
},
{
    20.0,26.44
     this video is going to break down some of the ways you can start releasing and stretching those tight knots.
},
{
    26.44,28.32
     So let's get started right away.
},
{
    28.32,32.8
     The first thing we're going to do is we're going to do some range of motion for your
},
{
    32.8,33.8
     neck.
},
{
    33.8,35.52
     So we're just going to do neck circles.
},
{
    35.52,37.56
     That's just to get started and to warm up.
},
{
    37.56,39.28
     Later on we have some other things we want to do.
},
{
    39.28,46.88
     But first, just do two circles on each side of going to each side with your neck okay and
},
{
    46.88,50.48
     you want to make sure that you go through each segment okay so instead of
},
{
    50.48,56.52
     just kind of doing it like that just go side then bring it forward look down look
},
{
    56.52,61.48
     down at the floor go to the other segment really try to feel your neck
},
{
    61.48,67.4
     going to the fullest range of motion that you possibly can.
},
{
    67.4,69.44
     You want to do two circles on each side.
},
{
    69.44,72.04
     Once you've done that side, go to the other one.
},
{
    72.04,78.2
     Again, trying to go through each segment, not skipping any segment.
},
{
    78.2,82.72
     You're trying to do it at the fullest range of motion that you can at this point.
},
{
    82.72,85.6
     If you can't do a lot of range of motion, that's fine too.
},
{
    85.6,89.76
     Just try your best to make these full circles.
},
{
    89.76,91.08
     Let's move on to the next thing.
},
{
    91.08,93.24
     After you've done two circles to each side,
},
{
    93.24,95.48
     we're going to go into what's called the self-miofascial
},
{
    95.48,99.28
     release or self-massage for simplicity.
},
{
    99.28,101.92
     So what you're going to do is just take two fingers,
},
{
    101.92,104.44
     place it at the base of your neck, kind of where neck and
},
{
    104.44,109.28
     shoulder meets, and try to find some tender, tight areas, okay?
},
{
    109.28,113.28
     And what helps is to move your neck to the other side away from that spot.
},
{
    113.28,119.16
     So palpate with your fingers, and then once you find a tight spot, just hold it, apply
},
{
    119.16,124.28
     pressure with it, and you want to hold it for about 30 to 60 seconds for that muscle
},
{
    124.28,125.52
     knot to release, okay? Once you seconds for that muscle knot to release.
},
{
    125.52,130.6
     Okay, once you've done that, go to another spot. Okay, again, palpate through, go up
},
{
    130.6,136.8
     or down, and again, hold it there once you find that tight area, and that's how
},
{
    136.8,141.36
     you get rid of trigger points or they're also called muscle knots that develop
},
{
    141.36,147.68
     around your neck and shoulder area. Most of the time we get trigger points in the upper trapezius or levator scapula muscle,
},
{
    147.68,149.64
     which is right around that area, okay?
},
{
    149.64,153.16
     So once you did that one side, you want to do it on the other side.
},
{
    153.16,157.08
     So again, two fingers, try to find some tight area.
},
{
    157.08,160.52
     Once you do, press down on it, apply some pressure.
},
{
    160.52,164.56
     To get it to release a little bit more, you want to look away from that area a little
},
{
    164.56,165.36
     bit. So you're kind of want to look away from that area a little bit.
},
{
    165.36,169.84
     So you're kind of stretching your neck away from that area as you're applying that pressure
},
{
    169.84,171.16
     with your fingers.
},
{
    171.16,175.24
     And again, you want to hold it for about 30 to 60 seconds for that muscle to release and
},
{
    175.24,176.48
     then go to the next spot.
},
{
    176.48,178.28
     Again, find another area.
},
{
    178.28,182.2
     Again, bring your neck away from there.
},
{
    182.2,185.0
     That's going to increase,'s gonna increase the stretch
},
{
    185.2,188.36
     so that you can really apply the pressure
},
{
    188.36,191.04
     into that neck really, really well.
},
{
    191.04,194.68
     Once you've done that, we're ready for the 90 second
},
{
    194.68,196.56
     a neck stretch routine.
},
{
    196.56,198.68
     And I recommend that you follow this routine
},
{
    198.68,200.28
     exactly the way I'm gonna give it to you.
},
{
    200.28,204.16
     It's made for a specific reason to be done in this way.
},
{
    204.16,206.0
     Okay, so let's get started right away.
},
{
    206.0,209.0
     The first thing I'm gonna do is you're gonna place one arm on the opposite side of the neck.
},
{
    209.0,214.0
     The other hand, just place it behind your back and make sure you press the shoulder down.
},
{
    214.0,220.0
     Okay, you don't want this shoulder to go up because that's gonna activate that upper trapezius muscle that we don't want.
},
{
    220.0,222.0
     That's the muscle that's probably causing you pain in the first place.
},
{
    222.0,228.1
     So make sure this shoulder is down, stretch your spine up, okay, and then again place
},
{
    228.1,232.52
     the arm behind you and now bring your ear to your shoulder, okay.
},
{
    232.52,236.44
     So that's all you're doing, it's just you're going straight down and you want to hold this
},
{
    236.44,237.68
     for 90 seconds.
},
{
    237.68,240.52
     You want to feel the stretch right over here.
},
{
    240.52,243.6
     This is the upper trap stretch.
},
{
    243.6,245.36
     And then once you're done that, we're going to
},
{
    245.36,249.24
     just change the angle of this and you're going to bring your head slightly forward.
},
{
    249.24,255.96
     So it's the same kind of area. Okay, I'm still very much ear to my shoulder, but I
},
{
    255.96,268.96
     bring my head forward slightly. I'm not changing the angle of the stretch. Again, bring this opposite shoulder down and again hold it for another 30 seconds.
},
{
    268.96,277.04
     And now we're going to change the angle of the head. So look down at your armpit. Sorry,
},
{
    277.04,285.16
     my equipment. And again, you're going to hold this one for 30 seconds.
},
{
    285.16,289.16
     And you want to feel it now a little bit more in the back of the neck going down to your
},
{
    289.16,290.64
     shoulder blade on this one.
},
{
    290.64,293.24
     Okay, so once you've done that side, let's switch to the other side.
},
{
    293.24,297.36
     Again, place that arm behind you, this one on the opposite side of the head, bring it
},
{
    297.36,299.68
     down, straight down to the side first.
},
{
    299.68,308.14
     30 seconds, hold on this one, then tilt your head slightly forward, again 30 seconds on this
},
{
    308.14,313.5
     spot and now we're going to change the angle and look down at our armpit or at
},
{
    313.5,317.82
     our pocket and again press down with your hand slightly apply some pressure
},
{
    317.82,326.68
     for another 30 seconds and you're going to feel it right over here.
},
{
    326.68,332.08
     So I know I'm going a little bit faster but you want to hold at each of these spots for
},
{
    332.08,336.04
     30 seconds and that's going to be 90 seconds total per side.
},
{
    336.04,338.16
     So again one more time to review.
},
{
    338.16,345.94
     This is 30 seconds here, 30 seconds bringing the head slightly forward, 30 seconds bringing the head
},
{
    345.94,351.94
     down to look at your pocket and that's how you want to do it. And I recommend
},
{
    351.94,355.78
     whenever you get a stiff or tight neck that you go through the sequence that I
},
{
    355.78,360.52
     laid out in this video. First start with some neck circles to each side, two times
},
{
    360.52,364.7
     to each side, then do some self-manifestial release with the fingers.
},
{
    364.7,368.1
     Okay if you don't, if this is too difficult with the fingers, there's other
},
{
    368.1,371.34
     tools out there. You can get a massage ball and apply pressure with it, or you
},
{
    371.34,376.92
     can use a theracane to apply pressure with that as well. But if not, you can do
},
{
    376.92,380.66
     the fingers. And then after that, go through this stretching routine, this 90
},
{
    380.66,384.82
     second stretching routine, that's gonna release more of that tightness and those
},
{
    384.82,386.3
     trigger points. So that's it for today of that tightness and those trigger points.
},
{
    386.3,387.44
     So that's it for today.
},
{
    387.44,388.98
     I hope you enjoyed this video.
