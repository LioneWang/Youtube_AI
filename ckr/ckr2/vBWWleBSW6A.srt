{
    0.0,31.52
     I'm going to do a quick head to toe assessment and see what's going on with Chad.
},
{
    31.52,34.52
     Again, I want to address the bleeding first.
},
{
    34.52,37.96
     What I do take note of immediately is coming out of his nose.
},
{
    37.96,40.38
     This is called Srebel spinal fluid.
},
{
    40.38,43.32
     That is fluid coming out of the nose or the ears.
},
{
    43.32,48.32
     It could be bloody and it could be mixed with fluid, kind of a white milky fluid.
},
{
    48.32,53.88
     What happens here is when there's a head injury or a gunshot to the head, the brain expands.
},
{
    53.88,57.08
     There's fluid around the brain called cerebral spinal fluid.
},
{
    57.08,59.84
     There's no place for this fluid to go when the brain expands.
},
{
    59.84,64.2
     What happens is it'll come out of the nose, can travel up through tubes called a station
},
{
    64.2,66.6
     tube and come out of the ears.
},
{
    66.6,69.48
     This is the type of bleeding that you don't want to control.
},
{
    69.48,73.52
     Chad's brain is swelling and blood is getting pushed out of his nose.
},
{
    73.52,75.72
     Claire's fluid is getting pushed out of his ears.
},
{
    75.72,77.4
     We want to let this bleed.
},
{
    77.4,80.24
     Your body will reproduce that cerebral spinal fluid.
},
{
    80.24,87.68
     So this is a key and tells us that Stephanie's providing spinal immobilization is very, very important. And what I'm looking at here
},
{
    87.68,90.88
     is looks like a chest injury. I need to expose a little bit further
},
{
    90.88,94.48
     and I'm gonna cut that area. Again, if you have a knife and you have to cut it to
},
{
    94.48,95.24
     expose it,
},
{
    95.24,99.04
     you'll do that. So I'm gonna cut and expose this area here.
},
{
    99.04,102.44
     It looks like he's got a
},
{
    102.44,105.46
     bullet wound to the chest here and there's some blood coming
},
{
    105.46,106.46
     out of it.
},
{
    106.46,110.64
     Now what I notice here is there's a little bit of a red mark down on the bottom.
},
{
    110.64,115.02
     What happens when a projectile hits a person at an angle is if it hits them straight on
},
{
    115.02,117.2
     it's going to make pretty much a perfect hole.
},
{
    117.2,121.78
     But depending on what that projectile does, whether it wobbles or oscillates or it hits
},
{
    121.78,125.3
     chat at an angle, it's going to cause a little bit of an indention.
},
{
    125.3,128.0
     So we know that this is an entrance wound.
},
{
    128.0,130.5
     There's another thing I know about this wound as well.
},
{
    130.5,133.4
     If you notice this black area, this speckled,
},
{
    133.4,134.9
     this is called tattooing.
},
{
    134.9,137.5
     What happens is, is when somebody is shot
},
{
    137.5,140.9
     from a close proximity, the muzzle blast comes out
},
{
    140.9,144.2
     and tattoos around and causes these black marks.
},
{
    144.2,146.2
     Sometimes brown, sometimes black.
},
{
    146.2,149.1
     So we know that this is an entrance wound.
},
{
    149.1,151.16
     We've got a bigger problem here though.
},
{
    151.16,153.5
     Chad is having difficulty breathing,
},
{
    153.5,156.24
     and I can see that there's blood coming out of this.
},
{
    156.24,159.66
     What's happening here is right behind Chad's chest here,
},
{
    159.66,162.0
     his lungs are sitting there,
},
{
    162.0,163.84
     and when the bullet wound goes in,
},
{
    163.84,167.3
     what can happen is that when Chad is breathing,
},
{
    167.3,171.34
     air is leaking out of his lungs and into this space right here.
},
{
    171.34,173.94
     So what happens is the air leaks into this space.
},
{
    173.94,177.26
     It's called a pleural cavity, and it puts pressure on the lungs.
},
{
    177.26,179.62
     And as more air leaks into this space,
},
{
    179.62,183.3
     the lungs start to squeeze closer and closer together.
},
{
    183.3,185.0
     So we need to close this up right away.
},
{
    185.0,189.0
     In essence, what we need to do is make a one-way valve.
},
{
    189.0,193.0
     We need Chad when he inhales to put all that air into his lungs
},
{
    193.0,195.0
     and exit out of this bullet wound.
},
{
    195.0,198.0
     Because what's happening is, as he'll breathe in,
},
{
    198.0,201.0
     the lungs will expand, air will come out.
},
{
    201.0,209.48
     When he exhales, the air goes back in and keeps putting pressure on the lungs. So we're going to do something called an occlusive bandage. There's two ways of
},
{
    209.48,214.32
     doing this. The homemade occlusive bandage is to take a piece of foil. In the military
},
{
    214.32,219.2
     they said to use your ID card, a piece of wax paper or anything that you can use. An
},
{
    219.2,224.08
     occlusive bandage is in essence a one-way valve. So what I'm going to do here is I'm
},
{
    224.08,225.0
     going to lay this down over his chest and I'm going to tapeway valve. So what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna lay this down
},
{
    225.0,228.3
     over his chest, and I'm gonna tape this down.
},
{
    228.3,231.5
     So what's happening here is as Chad inhales,
},
{
    231.5,233.9
     the air is getting pressed in from his lungs,
},
{
    233.9,235.6
     it's getting pushed out of that hole,
},
{
    235.6,238.6
     and it's coming out through this flapper valve of sorts.
},
{
    238.6,242.2
     And then it hopes that when he exhales,
},
{
    242.2,244.7
     that the air doesn't go back in there.
},
{
    244.7,247.5
     Now there is a certain condition what will happen is
},
{
    247.5,250.1
     if he starts to get better we know it works.
},
{
    250.1,253.1
     Sometimes there's something called attention pneumothorax
},
{
    253.1,257.8
     and what that means is that the lung tissue also has a hole in it
},
{
    257.8,262.5
     and what's happening there is the air is not only leaking out of this hole and back in
},
{
    262.5,267.86
     but it's leaking through the lungs into this pleural cavity and it's collapsing his lung.
},
{
    267.86,271.12
     So what will happen there is his condition will get worse.
},
{
    271.12,274.9
     The only way to treat this is, because you don't know if it's a tension pneumothorax
},
{
    274.9,280.04
     or a simple thorax as we call this, is to put an occlusive bandage over this and watch
},
{
    280.04,281.68
     Chad and see how he's breathing.
},
{
    281.68,284.12
     I can perform my head-to-toe assessment.
},
{
    284.12,290.78
     In three to four minutes, I want to again take note on how he's breathing. I can perform my head-to-toe assessment. In three to four minutes I want to again take note on how he's breathing. If his condition gets worse then
},
{
    290.78,295.1
     what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and take this occlusive bandage off and just
},
{
    295.1,299.86
     let as much air come out as possible. If he starts to breathe better then your occlusive
},
{
    299.86,305.0
     bandage is working. Anytime we suspect neck injury we roll this person as little as possible.
},
{
    305.0,309.0
     Again, if it's an emergency situation, we're going to roll them.
},
{
    309.0,313.0
     But if we do have the ability, the time, we can actually put a spine board here and chat
},
{
    313.0,318.0
     and put them on that spine board and we're going to tape them to that board and transport him.
},
{
    318.0,323.0
     But if you're out in a rural area and all you have is a vehicle and no way to call 911,
},
{
    323.0,330.32
     you're going to have to drag good old Chad here into your vehicle and move to the hospital.
},
{
    330.32,334.4
     So there's no simple way to do this. If you have to throw them over your back
},
{
    334.4,337.48
     and stick them in the back seat of the car that's what you're going to do. The
},
{
    337.48,341.56
     best bet is if you can get EMS, if you can get an ambulance or a helicopter here
},
{
    341.56,346.28
     and they'll have all that equipment to take care of them. If you don't, you do what you gotta do.
},
{
    346.28,347.92
     In an emergency situation,
},
{
    347.92,349.56
     you gotta make do with what you got.
},
{
    349.56,351.56
     It's called a critical thinking skill.
},
