     Hello everyone. My name is Dr. Scott Thompson. I am a doctor of occupational therapy and the director of clinical services here at Sabo.
},
{
    8.0,14.0
     Today I'm going to be showing you the best stroke recovery hand exercises, Stage 1.
},
{
    14.0,24.0
     Stage 1 exercises are for people who have just begun to be able to do movements with their hand, wrist and forearm.
},
{
    24.0,26.86
     But you still need to be using your unaffected limb
},
{
    26.86,29.58
     to complete movements or help it along.
},
{
    29.58,31.48
     You could be anywhere in your recovery,
},
{
    31.48,34.98
     it could be where you see just a little muscle twitch
},
{
    34.98,36.94
     all the way up to you can do,
},
{
    36.94,39.28
     let's say 75, 80% of the movement,
},
{
    39.28,42.58
     but you're still using your unaffected limb
},
{
    42.58,44.18
     to assist in some way.
},
{
    46.4,51.48
     The first exercise I want to show you is moving your wrist side to side.
},
{
    51.48,58.18
     You want to start with your hand facing down on a table and you want to move it side to
},
{
    58.18,59.18
     side.
},
{
    59.18,63.28
     But of course you're going to be using your unaffected hand to help it move.
},
{
    63.28,65.72
     The big thing that I wanna teach you is that
},
{
    65.72,70.72
     you need to work on finding how much assistance
},
{
    70.74,74.62
     you can give while still doing movement
},
{
    74.62,76.64
     with your affected limb.
},
{
    76.64,79.12
     A lot of people like to do the movement 100%.
},
{
    79.12,81.52
     They like to just pick their hand up and do this.
},
{
    83.64,87.68
     Well, you complete the movement, that's great. But the issue is that you haven't
},
{
    87.68,92.08
     worked or challenged the unaffected limb. That's the one that needs the most work.
},
{
    92.72,101.84
     So what I want to encourage you to do is practice all of these exercises by giving enough, just enough
},
{
    108.68,110.92
     enough, just enough assistance with your unaffected limb, but still doing the movement all the way through the entire range of motion.
},
{
    110.92,112.32
     See how well you can do.
},
{
    112.32,115.8
     Because the more that you do, the better your results can be.
},
{
    115.8,116.8
     All right.
},
{
    116.8,119.28
     So, wrist side to side.
},
{
    119.28,126.9
     We're going to go out, contract, keep moving, keep moving, keep moving, and to the other
},
{
    126.9,131.66
     side.
},
{
    131.66,135.36
     Now you might be able to hear that my palm is sticking to the table.
},
{
    135.36,139.08
     So one of the things I like to do is use a washcloth.
},
{
    139.08,144.08
     And whether your hand is in a fist or it's open, you can try to use the washcloth.
},
{
    144.08,145.96
     It's not going to work for everyone.
},
{
    145.96,149.64
     Sometimes you lose focus of what you're doing and focus more about trying to keep your hand
},
{
    149.64,151.0
     on the washcloth.
},
{
    151.0,154.16
     If it's distracting you or if it's not working, just get rid of it.
},
{
    154.16,160.04
     But it is a technique to help you move a little bit easier across the surface.
},
{
    160.04,165.32
     So you can put it on the washcloth and then then move to your side, and then move to the other
},
{
    165.32,166.32
     side.
},
{
    166.32,170.48
     And again, I might be moving faster or slower than you can.
},
{
    170.48,176.4
     But make sure that you're challenging yourself and making that affected limb work the entire
},
{
    176.4,179.0
     time.
},
{
    179.0,182.84
     Okay.
},
{
    182.84,188.76
     Next we want to work on wrist going up and down.
},
{
    188.76,189.76
     So we have a couple options.
},
{
    189.76,194.22
     One, I'm going to do it again on this washcloth because it's easier to do.
},
{
    194.22,198.88
     You want to have your hands in what we call a neutral position or sort of with a thumbs
},
{
    198.88,210.84
     up position. You're going to help move your wrist up and then move it down.
},
{
    210.84,220.56
     And up and back down.
},
{
    220.56,228.8
     And up and back down.
},
{
    228.8,234.32
     You can also do this if you have the ability by clasping your fingers together.
},
{
    234.32,242.32
     That helps you push and pull your wrist.
},
{
    242.32,247.6
     If you want to make it a little more difficult, you can elevate your wrist, probably not on
},
{
    247.6,249.64
     a washcloth but maybe a rolled towel.
},
{
    249.64,274.0
     You can elevate your wrist and then go down, I'm sorry, help it up and help it up.
},
{
    276.0,278.0
     Flip it over and up.
},
{
    281.0,282.0
     Two and three.
},
{
    287.64,290.48
     To give even more range of motion, you can actually drop your wrist off the edge of a table so that you have full range of motion.
},
{
    290.48,292.8
     And that'll give you the best exercise
},
{
    292.8,295.68
     or the most difficulty when you're doing these exercises.
},
{
    297.2,299.66
     Next, I wanna work on turning our hand over.
},
{
    300.88,303.96
     Most of you will probably start with your hand
},
{
    303.96,306.24
     flat on the table or in sort of a
},
{
    306.24,310.32
     neutral position with your thumb towards the ceiling. That's totally fine. We just
},
{
    310.32,313.6
     want to make sure that when we're doing this exercise and assisting with our
},
{
    313.6,317.4
     unaffected limb and only are you giving just the right amount of assistance
},
{
    317.4,322.52
     where your affected limb is still doing some of the work but you also want to be
},
{
    322.52,328.8
     making sure that you're not injuring or torquing or twisting your wrist because that can cause permanent
},
{
    328.8,336.8
     damage. So over,
},
{
    352.24,357.48
     And then we want to go over. Give him maybe a little bit of pressure up on the forearm to help rotate the forearm
},
{
    357.48,358.88
     and get your hand down.
},
{
    358.88,362.88
     Again, if you can't put your hand flat on the table, do not worry about that.
},
{
    362.88,365.04
     You'll eventually get those muscles
},
{
    365.04,369.2
     stretched out so you can do that. You don't want to force any of these exercises because
},
{
    369.2,376.24
     it's going to increase your spasticity. If your spasticity increases, stop, relax, reposition
},
{
    376.24,383.44
     yourself, and do start again. This exercise is opening and closing your hand. I'm going
},
{
    383.44,389.0
     to demonstrate it on a washcloth, but again, you do not have to use the washcloth.
},
{
    389.0,391.0
     You can do it without on a table.
},
{
    391.0,396.0
     And what I'm doing is I'm actually applying a little bit of pressure on my fingertips with my other fingers,
},
{
    396.0,400.0
     trying to help curl, and then guiding them in.
},
{
    403.0,405.8
     And again, you don't have to have a super tight fist.
},
{
    405.8,410.56
     You don't want to do this super fast because that's going to increase your spasticity.
},
{
    410.56,419.64
     And then you're going to want to put your thumb out and get your fingers to extend.
},
{
    419.64,427.92
     Sometimes you can also use washcloth to help extend your fingers. One last thing that you could do to really
},
{
    427.92,433.84
     challenge yourself is actually do endurance training for your muscles. And by doing that,
},
{
    433.84,440.28
     you will do one repetition of every one of the exercises in every direction. And that
},
{
    440.28,445.24
     will count as one set. So to show you, it would look something like this.
},
{
    445.24,446.9
     I'm gonna do it on the washcloth
},
{
    446.9,448.92
     just cause it causes less friction.
},
{
    448.92,452.08
     But remember, you don't have to do it on a washcloth.
},
{
    453.72,456.02
     So you would do side to side,
},
{
    459.72,463.84
     followed by wrist up,
},
{
    503.8,505.18
     and down, followed by closing your hand. And that's one set.
},
{
    505.18,510.44
     And I would suggest challenging yourself to do two sets, maybe three sets, maybe four
},
{
    510.44,511.88
     sets.
},
{
    511.88,513.24
     Thank you for joining me today.
},
{
    513.24,515.28
     I hope you've enjoyed these exercises.
},
{
    515.28,517.72
     And I look forward to seeing you next time.
},
{
    517.72,520.2
     Because with Sebo, there is no plateau in sight.
},
