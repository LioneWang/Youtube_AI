     Hey everybody, it's Doctor Jo and Princess Remy.
},
{
    5.0,7.36
     And today I'm gonna show you how to relieve a sore neck
},
{
    7.36,9.68
     from muscle knots or trigger points.
},
{
    9.68,11.2
     So let's get started.
},
{
    11.2,13.4
     Disclaimer alert, disclaimer alert.
},
{
    18.48,20.48
     So when you have sore muscles in your neck,
},
{
    20.48,23.5
     a lot of times they can be from trigger points
},
{
    23.5,30.0
     or some people call them muscle knots. But what that is is when the muscle gets really sore and it kind of balls up into one place and
},
{
    30.0,36.08
     it feels like a knot. So a lot of times with those knots, if you just stretch out those muscles,
},
{
    36.08,40.32
     that helps release those those knots or those trigger points because you're stretching out the
},
{
    40.32,49.48
     muscle to get it stretched back out. So one of my favorite ones for neck soreness or even neck pain is doing an upper trap stretch and that's that big
},
{
    49.48,54.52
     triangular muscle in the back, the upper part of that muscle. So the way to stretch
},
{
    54.52,59.62
     that or one of the ways I really like to do it is sit on your hand on the side
},
{
    59.62,64.16
     that is sore and that just keeps the shoulder down. Then you're gonna bring
},
{
    64.16,65.12
     your other hand up and over almost like you're going to bring your other hand
},
{
    65.12,70.48
     up and over almost like you're touching your ear there. You can you can come all the way over,
},
{
    70.48,76.08
     but if your shoulder is a little tight, just kind of go towards that side. The way you're going to
},
{
    76.08,86.64
     gently pull your head is completely to the side. So it's not at an angle. It's not looking up, you're kind of keeping that head forward and
},
{
    86.64,92.68
     just gently pulling to the side and you should feel that stretch right through
},
{
    92.68,97.52
     there in that upper trap area. Shouldn't be painful, you don't have to crank on it,
},
{
    97.52,102.04
     you just enough to get that stretch and you want to hold it for 30 seconds,
},
{
    102.04,108.54
     that's really what's gonna let that muscle go and get that trigger point or that knot out of there.
},
{
    108.54,110.64
     So holding that for 30 seconds,
},
{
    110.64,112.92
     take a little break, do that three times.
},
{
    112.92,116.16
     If you have enough time, I suggest doing both sides.
},
{
    116.16,118.0
     So then sitting on that side
},
{
    118.0,121.28
     and gently pulling over this way.
},
{
    121.28,123.56
     Just because even if you're not really having knots
},
{
    123.56,125.12
     on that side, when
},
{
    125.12,130.8
     the muscles tighten up, it really causes an imbalance. So I would definitely do both sides.
},
{
    130.8,134.76
     You can alternate back and forth doing three on each side, or you can do all three on one
},
{
    134.76,138.72
     side and then switch and do all three on the other side. So your choice.
},
{
    138.72,148.28
     So the next one that I really like when you're having that soreness from, you know, either muscle knots or just neck pain in general, is a levator scapulae stretch.
},
{
    148.28,153.24
     And so that levator scapulae muscle is the one that elevates or lifts our
},
{
    153.24,156.08
     shoulder blades. And so a lot of times when we're stressed out or when we're
},
{
    156.08,160.68
     starting a new exercise program for the first time, we end up getting that muscle
},
{
    160.68,164.52
     really tight because we're bringing it up like this and that overworks that
},
{
    164.52,167.76
     muscle. And it starts down at that shoulder blade or that scapula
},
{
    167.76,173.96
     and goes all the way up into the neck where those cervical spine the muscles
},
{
    173.96,178.24
     are up in there and so that's part of those cervical spine muscles. So this is
},
{
    178.24,181.2
     a great one to stretch out sometimes there'll be a knot in it a lot of times
},
{
    181.2,185.76
     it will be right down there and so a great way to stretch it out is if you
},
{
    185.76,190.96
     comfortably can on the side that you want to stretch, you're going to kind of bring your hand back
},
{
    190.96,196.08
     to that shoulder blade where you want your elbow to be up as high as it can. Now if this is a little
},
{
    196.08,201.12
     bit tight for you, you can bring it here, but this just kind of helps hold that shoulder blade down
},
{
    201.12,207.24
     so you can get a better stretch. So you don't have to if that's uncomfortable, you can still kind of put your hand underneath here.
},
{
    207.24,208.48
     But this is the way I learned
},
{
    208.48,209.92
     and this is the way that I always feel like
},
{
    209.92,211.92
     I get the best stretch for.
},
{
    211.92,215.48
     So now this time, you are gonna turn your head
},
{
    215.48,217.96
     almost like a 45 degree angle,
},
{
    217.96,220.04
     like you're looking at your opposite knee
},
{
    220.04,222.48
     or like you're going to tuck your nose
},
{
    222.48,225.56
     into your opposite armpit over here.
},
{
    228.64,229.8
     So take your other hand and bring it up behind your head. So you're not coming to the side.
},
{
    229.8,231.48
     You're not pulling it over this time.
},
{
    231.68,233.04
     You're coming at an angle.
},
{
    233.16,238.32
     So I like to put it behind my head up and over, almost like a helmet on there.
},
{
    238.66,241.48
     And then so you're going to pull down and in.
},
{
    241.48,245.16
     So like you can see almost like I'm trying to take my nose towards
},
{
    245.16,252.12
     my armpit or kind of that nose down towards the opposite knee. So again you
},
{
    252.12,255.36
     just want to feel a little stretch it should be kind of up in here a little
},
{
    255.36,259.4
     bit higher up now in that area you might feel it down at that shoulder blade
},
{
    259.4,263.56
     kind of getting that angle sometimes you might have to adjust a little bit to
},
{
    263.56,268.8
     get that stretch but it shouldn't be painful. It should be a nice comfortable little bit of tension,
},
{
    268.8,275.44
     a little bit of uncomfortableness stretch. Holding that for 30 seconds. And again, if you have time,
},
{
    275.44,280.72
     I would work both sides because those muscles all come up and connect to the spine. So arm up this
},
{
    280.72,288.0
     way and then pulling down almost like you're tucking your nose into your armpit
},
{
    288.0,294.0
     or kind of at that 45 degree angle while you're stretching there. So after you get that you can
},
{
    294.0,298.96
     shake it out just a little bit. Another one that tends to get really tight and sometimes get some
},
{
    298.96,303.84
     knots or those trigger points in there are scalene muscles and we have three different sets on each
},
{
    303.84,307.08
     side. So with these it's's gonna get the front ones.
},
{
    307.08,309.28
     And I'll show you a couple of different ways
},
{
    309.28,310.64
     so you can get the different angles.
},
{
    310.64,312.96
     Cause sometimes it's a little bit different for everybody.
},
{
    312.96,314.36
     One stretch is gonna be a little bit better
},
{
    314.36,316.52
     where the other one's gonna be a little bit better
},
{
    316.52,317.46
     for someone else.
},
{
    317.46,319.2
     So if I want to stretch this side,
},
{
    319.2,320.8
     I'm gonna take the other hand
},
{
    320.8,323.36
     and just kind of place it on that collar bone
},
{
    323.36,329.0
     or that clavicle bone right there. Just so I can gently pull it down. That just kind of place it on that collar bone or that clavicle bone right there just so I can gently pull it down that just kind of again helps hold
},
{
    329.0,333.62
     everything down to get a better stretch and so once you do that you can either
},
{
    333.62,339.62
     turn towards the same side and look up and get that stretch through there or
},
{
    339.62,346.24
     some people actually like to look away and turn up to get that stretch through there.
},
{
    346.24,351.56
     So again, since there's three different muscles of the scalenes in there, you might get just
},
{
    351.56,353.8
     a slightly different stretch if you look up.
},
{
    353.8,358.88
     Some people call this the portrait pose, or you can kind of turn your head away and then
},
{
    358.88,361.28
     get that stretch as well.
},
{
    361.28,364.4
     I would try both, see which one's the most comfortable for you.
},
{
    364.4,367.48
     Same thing, 30 seconds hold, three times.
},
{
    367.48,371.68
     If you wanna switch sides, you can look up that way,
},
{
    371.68,373.8
     or you can turn your head and go that way.
},
{
    373.8,375.94
     And so you're still gonna kinda get those stretches
},
{
    375.94,377.08
     either way.
},
{
    377.08,379.92
     So then the next one, again, is one of my favorites.
},
{
    379.92,382.2
     This is not only kind of stretching it out,
},
{
    382.2,384.0
     but it's strengthening a little bit too.
},
{
    384.0,387.72
     And a lot of times when you have those muscle knots, you do want to help strengthen the
},
{
    387.72,388.72
     muscle.
},
{
    388.72,392.48
     When you work that muscle, that's going to help relax that muscle when it's in that
},
{
    392.48,393.72
     tightened phase.
},
{
    393.72,395.92
     And so this is just a chin tuck.
},
{
    395.92,399.6
     And so if you've seen any of my other videos, chin tucks are one of my favorites.
},
{
    399.6,400.8
     It's good for posture.
},
{
    400.8,403.6
     Again, it's good for resetting those neck muscles.
},
{
    403.6,405.36
     It's strengthening and stretching.
},
{
    405.36,412.0
     So with a chin tuck, all you're doing is really tucking your chin in. So it's not going down,
},
{
    412.0,418.08
     but it's taking that chin and trying to push it back behind you. So sometimes I use my finger as
},
{
    418.08,423.44
     a target. Sometimes I don't. It's up to you. But if you want to use your finger as a target,
},
{
    423.44,426.0
     just place your finger on your chin, keep
},
{
    426.0,429.92
     your finger in the same spot, and then pull back.
},
{
    429.92,433.88
     So it kind of brings that chin and gives you a couple little chins.
},
{
    433.88,435.52
     Hold it for about three to five seconds.
},
{
    435.52,437.8
     It doesn't have to be a long time, and then relax.
},
{
    437.8,442.08
     And a lot of times, if it's tight, once you relax, you'll have a little bit of space in
},
{
    442.08,443.08
     between.
},
{
    443.08,444.88
     So it's nice to kind of get that visual feedback.
},
{
    444.88,446.12
     But again, you don't have to.
},
{
    446.12,448.96
     You can just tuck that chin in.
},
{
    448.96,450.4
     Sometimes this is hard.
},
{
    450.4,452.76
     If you're really tight, if those muscles are really tight,
},
{
    452.76,455.28
     if they're really sore, this is not
},
{
    455.28,456.64
     going to be a big movement for you.
},
{
    456.64,459.12
     You might just have a little bit.
},
{
    459.12,462.24
     Sometimes if you stand next behind a wall,
},
{
    462.24,464.8
     put your shoulders on the wall, you
},
{
    464.8,465.36
     can kind of try and push your shoulders on the wall, you can kind of
},
{
    465.36,470.2
     try and push your head into the wall and that'll help you get that chin tuck. So
},
{
    470.2,475.84
     the last one is kind of what a lot of people see for trigger points, releasing
},
{
    475.84,480.08
     trigger points or muscle knots, which is using a ball to really get into that
},
{
    480.08,483.8
     trigger point because sometimes the stretches are tough for people or maybe
},
{
    483.8,485.44
     you have something where
},
{
    485.44,490.56
     you shouldn't do those specific stretches so using a ball to get into that trigger point really
},
{
    490.56,496.8
     helps. So let's say I've got one here at my levator scab. This is just a racket ball. You can use a
},
{
    496.8,500.8
     racket ball. You can use a little cross ball if you want something a little more firm. You can use
},
{
    500.8,506.36
     a tennis ball. It's really your choice. Some people will lie down on the ball.
},
{
    506.36,509.0
     That's okay, but if you're really sore,
},
{
    509.0,511.24
     that's gonna be a little bit too much to start off with.
},
{
    511.24,515.2
     So I usually just as simple as finding that spot
},
{
    515.2,516.96
     and then just pushing down on it.
},
{
    516.96,519.48
     So all I'm doing is I'm pushing down that ball
},
{
    519.48,523.8
     into that spot just to get right on that trigger point.
},
{
    523.8,528.28
     And you can move it around a little bit and sometimes you'll go oh that's it I feel that spot right there and that's
},
{
    528.28,532.36
     kind of how mine is I often have a trigger point right there where that
},
{
    532.36,536.88
     levator scapulae muscle comes into the scapula or the shoulder blade. So this
},
{
    536.88,540.52
     one you can hold it for a little bit longer like a minute if you can tolerate
},
{
    540.52,545.72
     it but you might want to just start off with 10 seconds and then relax.
},
{
    545.72,549.18
     I wouldn't go pushing as hard as you can the first time
},
{
    549.18,550.58
     because it will make you sore
},
{
    550.58,552.26
     when you're just pushing on that muscle.
},
{
    552.26,554.84
     And sometimes just cranking on it and cranking on it
},
{
    554.84,557.54
     is actually not gonna be super beneficial.
},
{
    557.54,560.3
     You wanna give just enough pressure where you're feeling it,
},
{
    560.3,562.18
     but you don't wanna be so uncomfortable
},
{
    562.18,565.12
     where you're almost having tears coming down your face
},
{
    565.12,569.84
     because it's hurting so much because that's almost going to be a little bit kind of
},
{
    570.56,575.52
     contradictive to what you're doing because it's going to make it more sore. So really just finding
},
{
    575.52,580.64
     that nice amount less is more and if it feels okay then you can progress at pressure as you go.
},
{
    581.2,587.48
     So there you have it that was a way to relieve a sore neck from muscle knots or trigger points. If you'd like to help support my channel, make sure and click
