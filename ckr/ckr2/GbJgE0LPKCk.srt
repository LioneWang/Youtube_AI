    11.2,14.76

    14.76,16.08
     Brad Heineck, physical therapist.
},
{
    16.08,18.0
     We are the most famous physical therapists on the internet.
},
{
    18.0,19.36
     In our opinion, of course, Bob.
},
{
    19.36,20.56
     Pumped up, Brad.
},
{
    20.56,21.48
     Pumped up.
},
{
    21.48,25.36
     Okay, how to treat sciatica and spinal stenosis
},
{
    25.36,27.24
     or spondylolisthesis.
},
{
    27.24,28.36
     Spondylolisthesis.
},
{
    28.36,29.84
     I always say it wrong.
},
{
    29.84,34.04
     This was actually a request from a retired French doctor.
},
{
    34.04,34.88
     Oh really?
},
{
    34.88,38.04
     Yeah, on email and he said he had both
},
{
    38.04,40.92
     and he was a big fan and he was hoping
},
{
    40.92,41.9
     we could help him out.
},
{
    41.9,44.28
     We have had requests for this on our comment section
},
{
    44.28,45.32
     over the years, so it's about time we take care of it. We get to tackle for this on us. Yeah, that's right. On this section over the years.
},
{
    45.32,47.76

     We got 60 seconds of Bob and Brad every day.
},
{
    89.92,92.92
     All right, so the first thing,
},
{
    92.92,95.0
     maybe we should talk just a little bit about sciatica
},
{
    95.0,98.32
     and spinal stenosis, spinal lasty, whatever,
},
{
    98.32,99.76
     however you're saying.
},
{
    99.76,102.48
     With sciatica, generally what we're trying to do
},
{
    102.48,105.72
     is avoid flexion like this.
},
{
    105.72,109.56
     Especially flexion movements, rounded out postures,
},
{
    109.56,111.72
     slumped postures.
},
{
    111.72,114.36
     Unfortunately with spinal stenosis,
},
{
    114.36,116.6
     that is the posture that feels better.
},
{
    116.6,118.92
     That's a little more comfortable than standing up
},
{
    118.92,120.76
     or particularly back a little bit.
},
{
    120.76,123.08
     You might even have heard of shopping cart syndrome.
},
{
    123.08,126.36
     Like when you have spinal stenosis or spondy, you tend to wanna lean on the cart because it feels a little bit. You might have even heard of shopping cart syndrome. Like when you have spinal stenosis or spondy,
},
{
    126.36,128.08
     you tend to want to lean on the cart
},
{
    128.08,129.76
     because it feels a lot better.
},
{
    129.76,132.92
     Yesterday I just worked with a gentleman shopping cart.
},
{
    132.92,135.44
     He says, I feel so much better when I go shopping
},
{
    135.44,138.32
     and lean on my cart, I can walk as far as I want.
},
{
    138.32,140.8
     It just, how does this stuff just fall into place, Bob?
},
{
    140.8,142.6
     I don't know, but you know, the thing is,
},
{
    142.6,146.88
     I had one lady, the problem with that is that over time,
},
{
    146.88,149.32
     you get to the point where you can't even straighten up
},
{
    149.32,150.16
     anymore.
},
{
    150.16,151.0
     Right.
},
{
    151.0,152.48
     So we're gonna recommend,
},
{
    152.48,154.62
     I don't know if you wanna show a spondy or not.
},
{
    154.62,156.08
     Probably don't even need to show it, do you?
},
{
    156.08,158.28
     That's all right, we'll see how it works out here.
},
{
    158.28,162.0
     Yeah, you know, she was to the point where she couldn't
},
{
    162.0,164.2
     straighten up any more than this.
},
{
    164.2,167.92
     So the first thing I want you to do is do not play
},
{
    167.92,169.56
     into the flexed posture.
},
{
    169.56,171.08
     Even though it feels better,
},
{
    171.08,172.84
     I want you to stay as straight as possible.
},
{
    172.84,177.72
     We want to keep that spine as straight as possible.
},
{
    177.72,179.96
     Whenever you do any lifting or bending,
},
{
    179.96,181.8
     it all should come from the hips.
},
{
    181.8,183.44
     You know, you want the movement here.
},
{
    183.44,185.96
     This should stay as straight as possible.
},
{
    185.96,188.76
     If you are already flexed a bit or bent over,
},
{
    188.76,193.52
     we're gonna start you on pillows here for prone.
},
{
    193.52,195.14
     Right.
},
{
    195.14,199.44
     So, and if you got sciatica from a disc problem,
},
{
    199.44,201.92
     this is gonna help with that as well.
},
{
    202.92,204.4
     This can be a little tricky.
},
{
    204.4,206.6
     This is not a straightforward thing.
},
{
    206.6,209.48
     So we're gonna go through some detail on this
},
{
    209.48,210.72
     and there's gonna be options
},
{
    210.72,212.32
     and you'll see what works best for you
},
{
    212.32,213.56
     because you'll know it works best
},
{
    213.56,215.8
     because it feels better.
},
{
    215.8,219.2
     Pain, we don't wanna increase pain with any of this stuff.
},
{
    219.2,223.4
     This lady, I had her start on three pillows like this
},
{
    223.4,225.72
     and she couldn't tolerate less than this.
},
{
    225.72,228.2
     I mean, if we took away any one of the pillows,
},
{
    228.2,231.6
     eventually we were able to get down to two and then one.
},
{
    231.6,234.4
     But she never got down to zero.
},
{
    234.4,237.2
     But this is just a great stretch.
},
{
    237.2,239.96
     Relax for five to 10 minutes.
},
{
    239.96,244.6
     If you can, you can put your chin up on your fists like this.
},
{
    244.6,249.6
     But the idea is eventually to restretch your back
},
{
    249.6,251.44
     so they get back to straight again.
},
{
    251.44,252.34
     Right.
},
{
    252.34,254.84
     So we gotta get there's a string on your shirt.
},
{
    254.84,255.68
     Oh my God.
},
{
    255.68,256.5
     We can't have that.
},
{
    256.5,258.2
     All right, next we're gonna take out a pillow.
},
{
    258.2,260.24
     We're gonna work our way down.
},
{
    260.24,261.44
     It's as simple as this.
},
{
    261.44,263.64
     You know, it might take a couple of days.
},
{
    263.64,265.52
     It might be able to do it day one. That's gonna be up to the individual. But you wanna get as simple as this, you know, it might take a couple of days, it might be able to do it day one,
},
{
    265.52,267.48
     that's gonna be up to the individual.
},
{
    267.48,269.48
     But you wanna get as straight as possible.
},
{
    269.48,274.48
     If possible, you do wanna get down to this.
},
{
    274.62,277.88
     And maybe even this.
},
{
    277.88,280.64
     Now, if your body will let you know
},
{
    280.64,282.72
     you're either gonna have a back pain,
},
{
    283.76,287.24
     or if you develop pain down your leg or numbness
},
{
    287.24,289.04
     or symptoms, those are big red flags.
},
{
    289.04,290.96
     It means you're going too fast.
},
{
    290.96,295.24
     Go back to another pillow and give it some more time.
},
{
    295.24,296.92
     Brad has spondy.
},
{
    296.92,298.6
     Can you lay like that?
},
{
    298.6,300.24
     I can lay flat.
},
{
    300.24,301.2
     It's not real comfortable.
},
{
    301.2,302.96
     After a few minutes it's not comfortable.
},
{
    302.96,304.6
     I don't lay my stomach very much at all.
},
{
    304.6,306.92
     Right, and I think it's okay for you to do
},
{
    306.92,308.64
     for three to five minutes, right?
},
{
    308.64,311.4
     Or maybe three minutes, whatever it allows you.
},
{
    311.4,312.24
     Right, yeah.
},
{
    312.24,313.64
     But look at Brad, you have good posture, Brad.
},
{
    313.64,314.48
     Right, yeah.
},
{
    314.48,317.04
     Yeah, you're not crooked, you're not bent over.
},
{
    317.04,319.52
     When I go back to here, it's a little uncomfortable.
},
{
    319.52,321.7
     If I go back farther, and I repeat that,
},
{
    321.7,323.52
     I'm gonna have a back ache the next day.
},
{
    323.52,325.44
     But you're keeping keeping as straight as possible
},
{
    325.44,326.96
     as part of your deal.
},
{
    326.96,329.88
     And you had a grade two?
},
{
    329.88,331.68
     Yeah, it's grade two.
},
{
    331.68,333.22
     And it's fused now.
},
{
    333.22,334.06
     I hope so.
},
{
    334.06,334.9
     Yeah.
},
{
    334.9,335.74
     So.
},
{
    335.74,336.88
     I haven't had X-rays for a few years,
},
{
    336.88,339.76
     but it feels much better, so I feel comfortable with it.
},
{
    339.76,341.96
     I think he's a great example of someone that,
},
{
    341.96,345.16
     you know, again, that followed these tenets,
},
{
    345.16,347.24
     that up to keep it straight as possible.
},
{
    347.24,349.0
     Despite the, you know.
},
{
    349.0,350.08
     Pasture, posture.
},
{
    350.08,350.92
     Right.
},
{
    350.92,351.94
     All right, the other thing you can try,
},
{
    351.94,355.32
     number three is you can actually try some decompression
},
{
    355.32,357.68
     on the spine or traction.
},
{
    357.68,358.52
     Right.
},
{
    358.52,360.16
     Now we're gonna show you a simple way to do it.
},
{
    360.16,361.68
     It does involve a purchase.
},
{
    361.68,363.68
     You need to get the hanging handles.
},
{
    363.68,366.04
     Hanging handles.
},
{
    366.04,367.84
     And we're gonna have a link below
},
{
    367.84,370.26
     on where to purchase them, less than 50 bucks.
},
{
    370.26,371.1
     But these are great.
},
{
    371.1,373.24
     I use them all the time.
},
{
    373.24,374.88
     I just have them in my office.
},
{
    374.88,376.24
     And when I take a break,
},
{
    376.24,378.44
     it's just a great way to decompress the spine
},
{
    378.44,380.44
     and actually good for the shoulders too.
},
{
    380.44,382.48
     If you had pull-up bar, you can do that.
},
{
    382.48,383.92
     You can do a pull-up bar.
},
{
    383.92,385.12
     That would work too.
},
{
    385.12,386.24
     This is just a great thing
},
{
    386.24,388.88
     because it kind of keeps your back supported at the same time.
},
{
    388.88,389.84
     Right, right.
},
{
    389.84,391.72
     So, wanna go ahead and show up, Brad?
},
{
    391.72,394.12
     Yep, so back up against the wall.
},
{
    394.12,397.28
     Again, obviously these are gonna have to be put into a stud.
},
{
    397.28,399.76
     It comes with these anchors too.
},
{
    399.76,401.92
     It comes with the whole device here.
},
{
    401.92,403.54
     Right.
},
{
    403.54,406.44
     Yeah, this is a nice thing.
},
{
    406.44,408.78
     You're gonna have a level so when you're standing
},
{
    408.78,410.8
     you can grab here and you're not hanging.
},
{
    410.8,414.0
     And you're gonna see, I'm just gonna slowly go down.
},
{
    414.0,417.0
     And as you do this, you know, this should not create any pain.
},
{
    417.0,421.04
     It should just feel like a really good stretch.
},
{
    421.04,424.92
     And if you have sciatic, you may even have a point where
},
{
    424.92,426.76
     as you get the traction on your back,
},
{
    426.76,429.44
     the leg symptoms and pain gets better.
},
{
    429.44,431.48
     And if that happens, it's gold.
},
{
    431.48,434.48
     You just really want, then you're gonna wanna hang,
},
{
    434.48,437.28
     you know, 20 to 30 seconds and do that repeatedly
},
{
    437.28,439.64
     as long as the leg pain goes away.
},
{
    439.64,442.44
     Yeah, you can do it in shifts kinda here.
},
{
    442.44,443.28
     Yeah.
},
{
    443.28,444.6
     And you can do it, what's nice about this
},
{
    444.6,447.54
     is you can do it every hour or even 20 minutes,
},
{
    447.54,448.58
     whatever you wanna do.
},
{
    448.58,452.04
     I even try this spread sometimes.
},
{
    452.04,454.34
     I even do it this way.
},
{
    454.34,455.98
     And do some hanging.
},
{
    455.98,460.98
     And I also have done it where I hang,
},
{
    461.02,462.26
     of course I'm taller,
},
{
    462.26,464.32
     but you can actually pick your feet up.
},
{
    464.32,467.68
     But you can actually kinda just do gentle rotation.
},
{
    467.68,469.0
     It feels better.
},
{
    469.0,471.0
     If it doesn't feel better, you don't do it.
},
{
    471.0,471.84
     But-
},
{
    471.84,472.92
     All these are with caution.
},
{
    472.92,473.9
     Yep.
},
{
    473.9,475.88
     These are great for the shoulders, by the way, too.
},
{
    475.88,477.6
     We've had whole videos on that,
},
{
    477.6,481.16
     how they can help decrease shoulder pain, too.
},
{
    481.16,483.0
     Right, those impingement problems.
},
{
    483.0,484.48
     I'm gonna hang a little bit more, Bob.
},
{
    484.48,486.0
     All right. I'm just gonna hang out.
},
{
    486.0,488.24
     All right, we'll go to the next one, number four.
},
{
    488.24,489.8
     Okay, the fourth thing we want you to do
},
{
    489.8,491.84
     is some nerve flossing.
},
{
    491.84,495.08
     And this is for the sciatica basically.
},
{
    495.08,497.5
     And it can help desensitize the nerve
},
{
    497.5,499.6
     if you're getting pain down your leg.
},
{
    499.6,502.36
     Basically, we're trying to pull the nerve from one end
},
{
    502.36,504.5
     while releasing it from the other.
},
{
    504.5,508.64
     Now, warning, this can make your pain worse.
},
{
    508.64,511.36
     If it does, I mean, we're gonna have you try it once,
},
{
    511.36,515.2
     do a set of 10, wait a day and see how it did.
},
{
    515.2,518.76
     If it got worse, you're gonna wait another week
},
{
    518.76,520.64
     before you try it again.
},
{
    520.64,524.02
     If it was the same or better,
},
{
    524.02,525.96
     then you can keep doing it every day,
},
{
    526.92,529.56
     at least once or twice a day for 10 reps.
},
{
    529.56,534.56
     So let's go ahead, we need a high table or bench
},
{
    534.56,537.08
     where you can swing your legs a little bit.
},
{
    537.08,539.36
     They can swing underneath.
},
{
    539.36,542.2
     Like here, this gets in the way, so that's not good,
},
{
    542.2,544.44
     but I can go out a little bit and-
},
{
    544.44,545.64
     Yeah, it's not bad.
},
{
    545.64,546.48
     I mean, same with mine,
},
{
    546.48,548.68
     I'm kind of hitting this bar right here.
},
{
    548.68,551.44
     So I can go past it when I make adjustment on the table.
},
{
    551.44,552.84
     And that's, you know,
},
{
    552.84,555.04
     you probably can do some kind of adjustment.
},
{
    555.04,556.48
     You'll see once we do the exercise.
},
{
    556.48,557.96
     So you're gonna straighten one,
},
{
    557.96,561.28
     the side that the leg, the pain leg is,
},
{
    561.28,563.56
     the leg pain is on, I can get it out, Brad.
},
{
    563.56,567.68
     And at the same time, you're gonna extend your neck.
},
{
    567.68,569.64
     Wanna make sure you completely extend your neck,
},
{
    569.64,571.98
     don't just move your head like this,
},
{
    571.98,573.8
     move your entire neck like that.
},
{
    573.8,576.4
     So straighten the leg, extend the neck,
},
{
    576.4,579.0
     and bring the toe toward you.
},
{
    580.28,583.04
     Then go down, we're gonna show slow right here,
},
{
    583.04,585.46
     and then we'll pick it up at the speed.
},
{
    585.46,589.5
     Go down, flex the neck, flex the knee,
},
{
    589.5,592.24
     and put the toe down towards the floor.
},
{
    593.32,595.16
     We're going up, straighten the leg,
},
{
    595.16,597.74
     extend the neck, toe towards me.
},
{
    598.76,601.64
     Going down, flex the knee, flex the neck,
},
{
    601.64,603.24
     toe goes down to the floor.
},
{
    604.78,607.16
     Okay, we'll pick up the speed here a little bit Brad,
},
{
    607.16,608.68
     see if I can talk fast too.
},
{
    608.68,610.6
     Okay, extend the neck, extend the knee,
},
{
    610.6,612.88
     toe towards me, going down,
},
{
    612.88,615.4
     flex the knee, flex the neck, toe goes down.
},
{
    616.52,618.24
     Extend the neck, extend the knee,
},
{
    618.24,622.16
     toe goes towards me, flex the neck,
},
{
    622.16,625.0
     flex the knee, toe goes down to the floor.
},
{
    625.24,626.68
     We get the idea, Brad?
},
{
    626.68,627.52
     Yes.
},
{
    627.52,628.36
     Okay.
},
{
    628.36,629.2
     Be careful with it.
},
{
    629.2,631.56
     If it's not comfortable, you get some pain with it
},
{
    631.56,633.4
     or the leg pain gets worse.
},
{
    633.4,635.96
     Maybe if you got a sciatica or a disc problem,
},
{
    635.96,638.04
     it's so bad that this isn't tolerated.
},
{
    638.04,638.92
     Stop doing it.
},
{
    638.92,642.68
     It should feel reasonably comfortable.
},
{
    642.68,644.8
     And like Bob says, wait 24 hours,
},
{
    644.8,646.6
     see how it responds to it.
},
{
    646.6,648.68
     Yeah, you can try to get in a week
},
{
    648.68,652.08
     and if it's still stinging you,
},
{
    652.08,653.28
     you gotta forget it.
},
{
    653.28,654.52
     You gotta do these other things
},
{
    654.52,655.48
     and you can't do that one.
},
{
    655.48,656.66
     Right, sure.
},
{
    656.66,659.84
     All right, number five, stabilization exercises.
},
{
    659.84,662.56
     These are always great to strengthen the core,
},
{
    662.56,664.84
     but you wanna strengthen out the core
},
{
    664.84,668.52
     without really bending the core or extending the core.
},
{
    668.52,670.56
     Trying to keep that neutral posture.
},
{
    670.56,673.48
     I'll show the first one on here, Brad.
},
{
    673.48,675.0
     This is a great one for,
},
{
    675.0,679.24
     you wanna strengthen the front, sides, and back of the core.
},
{
    679.24,680.08
     Sure.
},
{
    680.08,682.08
     So we're gonna show you a real simple one.
},
{
    682.08,683.78
     You can put your hands underneath your back,
},
{
    683.78,687.08
     underneath your spine to give it support, like this.
},
{
    687.08,689.06
     And you're gonna lift your elbows
},
{
    689.06,691.86
     and you're just gonna raise your head towards the ceiling.
},
{
    692.88,694.16
     Right, towards the ceiling.
},
{
    694.16,696.08
     You see how when Bob comes up,
},
{
    696.08,699.04
     can you just get my fingers under shoulder blades?
},
{
    699.04,701.76
     And then you know your abdominals are working well.
},
{
    701.76,704.08
     Yeah, and you could start off, I don't know,
},
{
    704.08,706.36
     you could start off with a set of 10 or 20,
},
{
    706.36,707.64
     whatever you tolerate.
},
{
    707.64,710.22
     This should not increase your pain at all.
},
{
    710.22,712.44
     If you have never done sit-ups before,
},
{
    712.44,714.56
     10 is gonna be probably enough.
},
{
    714.56,715.48
     10 is gonna be plenty, right.
},
{
    715.48,718.04
     So then we wanna get the sides.
},
{
    718.04,719.56
     You wanna show a beginner side,
},
{
    719.56,722.32
     so this is just a side plank.
},
{
    722.32,723.96
     So you're just gonna bring your feet out
},
{
    723.96,726.96
     about two feet from the wall, keep them together,
},
{
    726.96,731.08
     keep your body straight, don't let it say again like this,
},
{
    731.08,732.92
     and tighten up that stomach,
},
{
    732.92,734.96
     and the leaning against the sides
},
{
    734.96,737.28
     will activate the side muscles,
},
{
    737.28,740.2
     so you get the side of the muscles engaged.
},
{
    740.2,744.24
     And you can stay here for 30 seconds or so.
},
{
    744.24,747.84
     Probably best to do both sides so you get even.
},
{
    747.84,749.24
     Now if that's too easy for you,
},
{
    749.24,751.96
     you can go ahead and try on the floor.
},
{
    751.96,754.04
     So all you're gonna do is bend your knees like this,
},
{
    754.04,755.36
     your elbows like this,
},
{
    755.36,758.08
     and you're just straight, extending your butt.
},
{
    758.08,761.4
     I mean, you're extending your legs here.
},
{
    761.4,764.88
     Getting in line, tighten up everything.
},
{
    764.88,766.88
     Make sure you breathe while you do this.
},
{
    766.88,769.16
     What I do is I do sets of 10, Brad.
},
{
    769.16,772.64
     I go, I count to 10 seconds, relax,
},
{
    772.64,774.52
     then do another 10 seconds.
},
{
    774.52,776.24
     I do like a set of four.
},
{
    776.24,779.84
     I just don't do that many, but that seems to be enough.
},
{
    779.84,782.12
     The final one, I'm gonna show this one real quick too,
},
{
    782.12,784.64
     Brad, is the point of dog.
},
{
    784.64,786.84
     So you're gonna be in this position here
},
{
    786.84,789.32
     and you're gonna slide your leg back
},
{
    789.32,791.2
     while raising the opposite arm.
},
{
    791.2,793.16
     Now if this is too hard for you to start off,
},
{
    793.16,795.44
     you might just start with the leg.
},
{
    795.44,797.76
     Or you might just start with the arm.
},
{
    797.76,799.72
     But I'm trying to keep the back real straight
},
{
    799.72,800.88
     while I'm doing these.
},
{
    800.88,802.44
     I don't know, how am I doing, Brad?
},
{
    802.44,804.92
     Good, good, you really got nice posture, Bob.
},
{
    804.92,806.6
     I'm impressed. Wow I don't know, how am I doing Brad? Good, good. You really got a nice posture, Bob. I'm impressed.
},
{
    806.6,807.96
     Wow, you've been practicing.
},
{
    807.96,810.48
     It takes a lot to impress Brad, so.
},
{
    810.48,814.4
     All right, so that'll give you some stabilization exercise.
},
{
    814.4,816.66
     We go into greater detail on some of these things
},
{
    816.66,820.1
     on our other videos, but this is basically
},
{
    820.1,822.72
     what you wanna try, and hopefully that'll help
},
{
    822.72,823.76
     decrease your pain level.
},
{
    823.76,824.8
     Sure.
},
{
    824.8,825.52
     Thanks for watching.
},
