     The following videos are a demonstration of the basic skills required to care for a child with a tracheostomy.

     This is not meant to replace hands-on training, but to provide an additional resource.
},
{
    20.0,23.0
     Personal protective equipment or PPE.
},
{
    23.0,26.32
     Gloves, sterile gloves and eye protection,

{
    26.32,32.0
     mask or gown as indicated. Appropriate sized disposable sterile suction

{
    32.0,36.76
     catheter clearly marked with numbers. Individually packaged suction device
},
{
    36.76,42.48
     for oral and nasal suctioning if indicated. Self-inflating bag connected to
},
{
    42.48,48.0
     an oxygen flow meter. Normal saline in disposable vial, or sterile water,
},
{
    48.0,57.0
     pulse oximeter, suction source, so you'll need a wall regulator or portable machine, and have connector tubing and a collection container,
},
{
    57.0,61.0
     stethoscope, and a trach to go bag at the bedside.
},
{
    61.0,67.08
     Perform hand hygiene before patient contact. Ensure that the appropriate supplies
},
{
    67.08,73.0
     for the procedure and emergency resuscitation equipment are fully functioning and available
},
{
    73.0,78.92
     at the bedside. Verify that the suction unit is turned on and that the pressure is within
},
{
    78.92,85.0
     the recommended range. Set the suction pressure between 80 and 100 millimeters of mercury for infants
},
{
    85.0,89.0
     and between 100 to 120 millimeters of mercury for children.
},
{
    89.0,94.0
     Check the unit's negative pressure by occluding the end of the suction tubing
},
{
    94.0,97.0
     before attaching the suction catheter.
},
{
    97.0,101.0
     Select the appropriate type and size of suction catheter.
},
{
    101.0,111.0
     Use a suction catheter with measurement markings. Using the trach size, multiply by
},
{
    111.0,116.32
     two and then round down to an even number to determine the size of the suction catheter.
},
{
    116.32,129.04
     For example, if you have a trach size of 4.5, multiply it times two, that equals nine. You round down to eight, so you'll know that you'll use a eight-french suction catheter.
},
{
    129.04,132.88
     Verify the pre-measured length for the suction catheter insertion
},
{
    132.88,136.56
     before inserting the catheter into the airway.
},
{
    136.56,138.8
     If the pre-measure depth is unknown,
},
{
    138.8,147.44
     obtain the depth by measuring the length of an extra tracheostomy tube of the same size. Record the appropriate
},
{
    147.44,152.24
     length of the catheter insertion measurement in the child's record and display the length at the
},
{
    152.24,160.16
     bedside if it is not already displayed. Perform hand hygiene and Dawn gloves. Open the sterile
},
{
    160.16,168.64
     suction catheter package on a clean work surface. Maintain sterility on the inside of the package.
},
{
    168.64,173.72
     If indicated, set up a flush solution to flush the catheter and clear thick secretions of
},
{
    173.72,178.08
     the tubing as necessary between suctioning events.
},
{
    178.08,184.12
     Fill the container with enough sterile water or saline to flush the catheter as needed.
},
{
    184.12,187.68
     Coil or wrap the suction catheter around the dominant hand.
},
{
    188.88,192.64
     Using the non-dominant hand, pick up the suction connection tubing
},
{
    192.64,194.4
     and connect it to the suction catheter.
},
{
    196.64,203.2
     If indicated, pre-oxygenate the child using the ventilator or self-inflating bag with 100%
},
{
    203.2,207.92
     oxygen for between 30 and 60 seconds.
},
{
    207.92,213.36
     Disconnect the child from the ventilator circuit with a non-dominant hand or instruct an assistant
},
{
    213.36,218.44
     to disconnect the child if clinically indicated.
},
{
    218.44,223.12
     Insert the suction catheter into the tracheostomy tube to the pre-measured length.
},
{
    223.12,228.76
     When the pre-measure depth is reached, withdraw the suction catheter using a twisting or twirling motion,
},
{
    228.76,232.84
     while at the same time applying continuous or intermittent suction.
},
{
    232.84,238.12
     Limit the total suction time of each suctioning event to less than 10
},
{
    238.12,244.44
     seconds. Coil the suction catheter around the dominant hand and return the
},
{
    244.44,245.44
     child to the ventilator
},
{
    245.44,248.32
     circuit with the non-dominant hand.
},
{
    248.32,253.96
     Hyperoxygenate the child after the suctioning event for 30 seconds.
},
{
    253.96,259.72
     Assess the need for more suctioning and repeat steps for passing the suction catheter.
},
{
    259.72,269.92
     Flush the catheter with sterile water or saline solution if indicated to maintain patency. Allow the child sufficient recovery time between passes of the
},
{
    269.92,275.4
     suction catheter. Evaluate and assess the tracheostomy to patency if tracheal
},
{
    275.4,280.6
     secretions do not clear or indicators for suctioning do not improve after
},
{
    280.6,290.68
     repeated passes of the suction catheter. With the catheter wrapped around the dominant hand, pull the glove off around the catheter inside out, remove
},
{
    290.68,295.6
     the other glove and discard it in a waste container. Flush the connecting
},
{
    295.6,301.04
     tubing with sterile water or saline solution. Secure the suction device at
},
{
    301.04,305.92
     the bedside in clear view for future suctioning needs.
},
{
    305.92,310.48
     Assess the child's cardiopulmonary status and breath sounds to detect any pertinent
},
{
    310.48,313.28
     changes after suctioning.
},
{
    313.28,320.08
     Discard supplies, remove personal protective equipment, and perform hand hygiene.
