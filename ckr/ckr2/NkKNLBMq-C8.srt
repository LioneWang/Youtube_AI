     Hey, this is Sarah with RegisterNurseRN.com and today I'm going to show you how to find
},
{
    5.12,8.72
     a vein on your patient before you start an IV.
},
{
    8.72,13.0
     Starting an IV takes skill and one of the skills to help you be successful at it is
},
{
    13.0,18.44
     to find a good vein that is viable that you're going to be able to stick first time and make
},
{
    18.44,20.72
     it easier for the patient and for yourself.
},
{
    20.72,30.0
     So in this video I'm going to show you how to find veins. Typically in males, males are a little bit easier to find veins on, especially if they're healthier,
},
{
    30.0,36.0
     because males, veins tend to be superficial and larger compared to a female.
},
{
    36.0,44.0
     Females, unless they do cardiovascular exercise or an athlete, their veins are a little bit more covered with subcutaneous fat.
},
{
    44.0,45.28
     So in a male, you're typically going to see larger veins. or an athlete, their veins are a little bit more covered with subcutaneous fat.
},
{
    45.28,48.6
     So in a male, you're typically gonna see larger veins.
},
{
    48.6,52.24
     So this person I'm using is male and he's healthy,
},
{
    52.24,54.96
     so his veins are a lot easier to find.
},
{
    54.96,57.24
     In the hospital setting, you're probably not gonna have
},
{
    57.24,59.6
     a patient with great veins like you're about to see
},
{
    59.6,60.72
     here in a second.
},
{
    60.72,63.84
     Patients in the hospital are usually really sick,
},
{
    63.84,66.08
     they're dehydrated, so their veins are
},
{
    66.08,69.24
     going to be smaller and a little bit more difficult to find.
},
{
    69.24,73.52
     So here we go and I'm going to show you how to do that.
},
{
    73.52,78.88
     Okay, first you'll want to tell the patient what you're doing that you're going to be
},
{
    78.88,80.12
     looking for a vein.
},
{
    80.12,85.32
     You probably want to spend a minute or two trying to find a vein.
},
{
    85.32,90.0
     And if you notice his veins, you can see them already without a tourniquet.
},
{
    90.0,93.68
     Most people, you have to put the tourniquet on to get these veins to pop out.
},
{
    93.68,96.0
     So here in a second, I'll put the tourniquet on.
},
{
    96.0,98.52
     But notice you can already see his veins.
},
{
    98.52,101.24
     So when you put the tourniquet on, tell them what you're doing, you're going to put the
},
{
    101.24,106.92
     tourniquet on, and try to put the tourniquet on tight, but not too tight, and ask them if it's too tight.
},
{
    106.92,108.2
     But you want it tight enough
},
{
    108.2,110.8
     so it makes the blood pool in the lower extremity.
},
{
    112.64,116.52
     And already these veins are starting to collect with blood
},
{
    116.52,118.52
     and becoming gorge.
},
{
    118.52,122.48
     Two tips to help engorge the veins the best you can.
},
{
    122.48,125.88
     Have the patient lower their arms so the blood
},
{
    125.88,132.92
     pulls down to the extremity. Next have the patient pump their hand. This causes
},
{
    132.92,139.04
     the blood to really pull. Okay, so they get nice and engorged and compared to
},
{
    139.04,143.76
     before these veins have became more engorged. So I'm going to talk about the
},
{
    143.76,147.0
     different areas that we typically start an IV on.
},
{
    147.0,150.3
     You always like to use the hand or the arm.
},
{
    150.3,154.6
     We very rarely go up, up into the shoulder or anything like that.
},
{
    154.6,157.0
     That's usually on really patient to your heart to stick.
},
{
    157.0,160.0
     Typically, the arm is sufficient enough.
},
{
    160.0,162.9
     So first I want to talk about the anti-cubital area.
},
{
    162.9,164.6
     This is the AC area.
},
{
    164.6,167.28
     You may hear in the hospital setting, the nurse say,
},
{
    167.28,169.72
     he has an 18 gauge and is right AC.
},
{
    169.72,173.16
     So this is the AC area that they're talking about.
},
{
    173.16,176.92
     Typically in the human, the veins are always in the same spot.
},
{
    176.92,180.32
     So everyone should have the same veins and same areas.
},
{
    180.32,182.88
     They can be a little bit to the left or to the right,
},
{
    182.88,185.0
     but generally they'll be in these areas.
},
{
    185.0,190.0
     Right here is a vein. This is a very large, great vein.
},
{
    190.0,193.0
     You could get an 18 gauge in this vein.
},
{
    193.0,196.0
     There's a vein right here in the middle.
},
{
    196.0,203.0
     I really like this vein. I normally use it a lot because it's in patients that I can easily find.
},
{
    203.0,206.4
     I don't see this vein a lot, especially in females.
},
{
    206.4,211.68
     I normally see this vein, so I stick that one, and then this one. This is another favorite one.
},
{
    211.68,218.24
     People really like to draw blood out of this one too. A key, some people are seers. They can see
},
{
    218.24,225.34
     the vein and they poke it. I'm a filler. I have to be able to fill the springiness of the vein. It tells me a lot about
},
{
    225.82,230.76
     How if the vein rolls if how large it is and where the placement of it is?
},
{
    231.04,233.04
     So if you're a filler
},
{
    233.84,240.28
     What you need to do is you need to take your index finger and always fill the vein veins have a unique feel to them
},
{
    241.12,244.36
     Compared to like if you're filling the skin it doesn't feel like a vein
},
{
    244.36,249.56
     So if you're new to starting IVs, I really recommend you practice on yourself with feeling your
},
{
    249.56,253.72
     veins. Like put a tourniquet on and just fill your veins. Get a feeling for them because
},
{
    253.72,258.0
     once you understand how they feel, you'll know whether you're feeling a vein or not.
},
{
    258.0,261.4
     That was the biggest thing. Whenever I was a student, I would always say, am I feeling
},
{
    261.4,267.0
     a vein? It's not a vein. But now I know without a doubt because I have it down so well of how the vein feels if it's a vein.
},
{
    268.2,269.6
     So that's your AC region.
},
{
    269.9,273.5
     Next region that people like to stick IVs in is the forearm.
},
{
    273.5,276.2
     Tip-flip forearm is from here to here.
},
{
    276.2,278.1
     So that's the forearm area.
},
{
    279.3,281.4
     There's a lot of veins in the forearm.
},
{
    282.2,287.4
     On this person, he has a a really really nice vein right here.
},
{
    287.4,294.22
     It's very large, a little bit of a skinnier one right here and then some more
},
{
    294.22,299.54
     in this area. Typically people like to go in this area but I have seen them on the
},
{
    299.54,306.64
     top of the arm. Not a lot of people have superficial bangs on the top of the arm and then on the back of the arm too.
},
{
    308.08,317.04
     There's some. If you have a man and he is hairy like this you'll want to like shave it with not the
},
{
    317.04,323.12
     straight blade but just little clippers and just trim the hair so whenever you do get your IV you
},
{
    323.12,329.08
     can tape it down because I've seen a lot of times where you take down the IV and the tape comes unloose
},
{
    329.08,333.8
     within an hour or two and you lose your IV so that's always disheartening when
},
{
    333.8,336.84
     you lose an IV because you didn't tape it down right so typically just clip the
},
{
    336.84,342.44
     hairs on a male patient if they have long hair. Next is your hand. People really
},
{
    342.44,345.9
     love to start IVs in the hand because the hand does not
},
{
    345.9,351.44
     have a lot of fat in it so they're really superficial and you can find them
},
{
    351.44,357.58
     very well. So in this person he has really nice hand veins but a problem with
},
{
    357.58,362.32
     the hand veins is when you start an IV these veins like to roll. So let me give
},
{
    362.32,365.6
     you some tips on how to prevent a rolling
},
{
    365.6,369.36
     vein. First of all, whenever you're assessing your veins, you want to make
},
{
    369.36,373.52
     sure it isn't a roller. How you can tell if a vein is a roller, you'll take your
},
{
    373.52,379.2
     finger and just sort of mess with it. And whenever you mess with it, do you see
},
{
    379.2,386.0
     how these, see how that vein right there, like, so rolls side to side. Okay, what's gonna happen?
},
{
    386.0,389.0
     If we didn't use this trick, I'm gonna show you.
},
{
    389.0,392.0
     If I poked him with a needle, or I poked the skin,
},
{
    392.0,396.0
     whenever I poked it, it would go to the side like that, okay?
},
{
    396.0,400.0
     And then your needle would go beside of the vein and set it in it.
},
{
    400.0,403.0
     And then it would roll, you'd miss, and you'd have to trial it over.
},
{
    403.0,407.4
     So what you would do is you have the patient hold their hand nice tight fist and
},
{
    408.44,411.48
     See it keeps really really tight
},
{
    411.48,416.84
     So whenever I stick him with this need with the needle it wouldn't roll less likely to roll
},
{
    416.84,420.48
     So that's always a tip now if you were starting it up in the forearm
},
{
    420.48,425.64
     And it was a rolling vein you could just keep it taut like that. Just
},
{
    425.64,431.24
     do your hand out like that and keep it taut and then poke it with a needle and
},
{
    431.24,434.64
     it should keep it from rolling. Sometimes veins are going to roll and it's just
},
{
    434.64,438.24
     going to happen but those are some little tips and tricks on how to prevent
},
{
    438.24,442.24
     that. And then whenever you're done of course starting your IV you'll pop the
},
{
    442.24,447.84
     turn it off real fast and then you're done, of course, starting your IV. You'll pop the turnip off real fast, and then you're done.
},
{
    449.6,450.98
     So that was just a little bit, some of the tips and tricks I've learned
},
{
    450.98,454.36
     over my nursing career on how to find a vein.
},
{
    454.36,455.48
     They've helped me throughout the year,
},
{
    455.48,458.52
     and I've increased my success rate with starting IVs.
},
{
    458.52,460.52
     I will be making a video on how to start IVs,
},
{
    460.52,461.8
     so please check that out.
