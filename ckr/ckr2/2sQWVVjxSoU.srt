     What's up everyone?

     Hey, Jared Bechbrand here, doctor of physical therapy and postpartum specialist.
},
{
    8.76,14.24
     Joined here by my lovely wife today and we would like to show you how to check for diastasis
},
{
    14.24,15.24
     recti.
},
{
    15.24,17.44
     Now, first of all, what is diastasis recti?
},
{
    17.44,21.84
     It is actually a separation of your abdominal muscles.
},
{
    21.84,25.96
     Most often I encounter this in pregnant and postpartum women. What
},
{
    25.96,31.8
     happens is as your baby grows, your abdomen has to expand in order to accommodate that
},
{
    31.8,37.52
     baby in order to create more room for a human or to grow. Now, the foremost muscle in your
},
{
    37.52,42.2
     abs, it's called your rectus abdominis, it's joined by some connective tissue, kind of
},
{
    42.2,46.7
     like a ligament. As your baby grows, this ligament is designed to soften
},
{
    46.7,49.98
     and stretch in order to expand your abdomen
},
{
    49.98,51.62
     and create more space for your baby.
},
{
    51.62,53.86
     It's a completely natural condition.
},
{
    53.86,57.38
     In fact, studies have shown that 100% of women
},
{
    57.38,59.46
     who make it to their third trimester
},
{
    59.46,61.72
     experienced some degree of this
},
{
    61.72,63.78
     diastasis recticepiration.
},
{
    63.78,65.2
     Now, the thing about it is
},
{
    65.2,70.16
     it doesn't always go back together after childbirth. Studies went to look at women
},
{
    70.16,76.0
     one year later, so one year after giving birth, one in three, so 35% of these
},
{
    76.0,80.92
     ladies still had some degree of abdominal separation. It's something that
},
{
    80.92,89.44
     doesn't always come back together on its own. And in my professional experience, it's something that's not checked for that regularly.
},
{
    89.44,93.52
     So I'm curious, those of you who are watching right now, I'm curious to hear your experience.
},
{
    93.52,97.2
     Were you checked for diastasis recti after you had your baby?
},
{
    97.2,100.24
     Go ahead and drop that into a comment down below.
},
{
    100.24,102.96
     Now, what are the implications behind this?
},
{
    102.96,109.1
     If you do have this abdominal separation, it has affected the integrity of your core.
},
{
    109.1,115.0
     This can lead to low back pain, hip and SI joint pain, pelvic floor dysfunction and even
},
{
    115.0,120.04
     the appearance of that mommy tummy or pooch or pouch or whatever it is that you would
},
{
    120.04,121.04
     like to call it.
},
{
    121.04,123.52
     So there are certainly some implications behind it.
},
{
    123.52,128.36
     We do definitely need to be aware of it. And so this is how you check for it at home.
},
{
    128.36,132.42
     Camille is going to help me out with this part. What you're going to do is lay
},
{
    132.42,138.36
     down on your back with your knees bent in a nice relaxed position. Now with one
},
{
    138.36,142.32
     hand you're going to put three fingers vertically right at your belly button.
},
{
    142.32,149.44
     The other hand is going to go up and behind your head. Now all that Camille is going to do is lift her head up off of
},
{
    149.44,153.44
     the table and this generates a little bit of tension through her abs and
},
{
    153.44,158.48
     across that ligament. Now with her left hand she's going to slowly feel right up
},
{
    158.48,163.2
     that connective tissue and we're going to go for about two to three inches above
},
{
    163.2,168.8
     her belly button and then she also needs to come down about 2 to 3 inches below her belly button.
},
{
    168.8,170.88
     There are two things that you're feeling for.
},
{
    170.88,176.32
     You want to feel for the width of a separation is there, meaning the two halves of that muscle
},
{
    176.32,178.42
     should be in nice and close.
},
{
    178.42,181.0
     About one finger width would be considered normal.
},
{
    181.0,185.36
     If you get to an area where there's a little more space, what you can do is then turn
},
{
    185.36,191.36
     your fingers horizontally to assess the width of that separation or the distance between those two
},
{
    191.36,197.44
     halves of that muscle. It's common to encounter a two, three, four, and even up to five finger
},
{
    197.44,202.64
     separation depending on the severity of your diastasis recti. That would be one indication.
},
{
    202.64,210.72
     The other indication, the other thing that we want to feel for is the integrity of that connective tissue, meaning the depth of that separation.
},
{
    210.72,215.36
     When you come to an area where you feel like it's maybe a little wider, what you can do is push
},
{
    215.36,221.84
     down into that ligament to feel the integrity. It should be nice and firm, and it should offer some
},
{
    221.84,227.36
     resistance. If a diastasis is present. It can be soft, squishy,
},
{
    227.36,233.2
     or spongy in feeling. That would be another indication that you do have a diastasis recti
},
{
    233.2,238.64
     separation. Now I'm curious, those of you who performed this test at home, how many of you
},
{
    238.64,243.28
     found that you actually do have this diastasis condition? I would be curious to hear from you.
},
{
    243.28,246.92
     Go ahead and leave another comment down below. I would love to hear from you. I'd love to
},
{
    246.92,252.2
     hear about it. Now if you do find that you do have a diastasis recti, a lot of
},
{
    252.2,256.32
     people will say, well I need to work on my core to increase core strength. Please
},
{
    256.32,261.64
     stop doing the regular core exercises, the sit-ups, the crunches, the planks.
},
{
    261.64,269.54
     Those traditional exercises actually make the condition worse and can actually increase that diastasis separation. You need to
},
{
    269.54,274.5
     avoid the wrong exercises but start doing the right exercises in order to heal
},
{
    274.5,277.4
