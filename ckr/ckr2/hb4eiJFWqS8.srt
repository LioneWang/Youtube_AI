     Hi, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist. Oh, Brad Heineck, physical therapist. Together we are the most famous physical therapists on the internet.
},
{
    7.0,12.0
     In our opinion of course, Bob. Brad, we get a lot of questions. People want to know if they have a herniated disc or not.
},
{
    12.0,20.0
     Herniated disc, lip disc, prolapse disc, there's all these different names for it. Basically the disc comes out where it should be and it's pushing on a nerve.
},
{
    20.0,28.24
     So we're going to show you three quick tests. Now this isn't making you a doctor and this isn't something you're gonna You want to rely upon but it is something that maybe you can you know
},
{
    28.4,31.6
     It might prompt you then to go to your doctor if you're having some of the
},
{
    31.92,36.96
     These signs are positive or and and some of the symptoms are that we'll mention at the end of the video
},
{
    36.96,40.42
     Right, so just three quick tests. These are tests the doctor may do with you
},
{
    40.8,50.16
     The first one for certain to do with them once you go and lay down Brad. Sure, I'm ready for a nap. This is a straight leg raise. This is probably the gold standard for
},
{
    51.44,55.84
     for a hernia desk and it's best if you do have somebody else that can help you do this. You
},
{
    55.84,61.76
     could try it on your own. We're going to say that Brad's getting pain on the left side,
},
{
    61.76,69.52
     on the left leg, down the left leg. So what you're going to do is keeping the leg straight, toe pointed straight up, I'm just going to bring the leg up like this.
},
{
    71.2,76.8
     And for a lot of patients I've had that have had a hernia, this starts bringing it on right away.
},
{
    76.8,81.76
     Yeah, somewhere in this range, they'll start getting the pain right away. And what you can even do
},
{
    81.76,89.88
     is back off a little bit, until the pain is off then have him push your toe toward him, toward his chin and if that brings it
},
{
    89.88,95.28
     on again, not just stretching pain but that pain that you've been feeling down the leg,
},
{
    95.28,99.6
     that's a pretty positive sign that you're getting sciatic nerve pain that's you know
},
{
    99.6,103.4
     the herniated disc is pushing on the nerve and causing pain down the leg.
},
{
    103.4,107.84
     So this is the number one test that people do to see if they have a herniated disc is pushing on the nerve and causing pain down the leg So this is the number one test that people do to see if they have a herniated disc
},
{
    107.84,110.8
     And also Bob if I can talk. Sure
},
{
    112.4,115.8
     A lot of times the pain will be up in the back
},
{
    116.04,119.34
     You know you'll do that and say I feel pain in the buttock or up in the low back
},
{
    119.34,124.52
     And that's even more positive because you're not stretching any tissues very good part from the back
},
{
    124.52,126.6
     So when you're allowed to talk you say good things
},
{
    127.4,131.94
     The other thing is if it could cause pain in the back and it could also cause the pain going all the way down
},
{
    131.94,137.92
     Sure, so all right the second one Brad, and this is just a quick test too. Once it stands up
},
{
    138.3,142.36
     Well, we have you'll say a lot of doctors are gonna have me do it. Lonnie if you can kind of pan down
},
{
    143.32,146.24
     Brad's gonna show you what we have patients doing.
},
{
    146.24,151.76
     This is checking for weakness or even sometimes pain with this. Right, so forgive the floor
},
{
    151.76,156.8
     we're getting our new floors in in a couple months, so just put up with the checkers. Okay, so
},
{
    157.44,162.64
     they'll have you do this, walk on your heels they'll say, the doctor or therapist, I do this a lot
},
{
    162.64,165.96
     with my patients, or walk on your toes. Now if you find that on one leg
},
{
    165.96,172.62
     you can do this and the other leg that doesn't, that would be a positive. You're unable to pull that toe up like that
},
{
    172.82,179.96
     That's a positive sign. Or if you can't stay on your toes. Or it might be like this and you're doing that. Or you might be having pain with that.
},
{
    180.08,185.0
     Come back up here. Oh, do you us. Yeah, I mean payment with that
},
{
    189.62,189.7
     Now this could be other things too, but just another possibility with that
},
{
    195.56,200.6
     It's a herniated disc. The third one is a seated test Brad, seated or slump test I wonder if this might be better off to the side even. Oh sure, let's
},
{
    201.48,203.48
     Bring it this way
},
{
    208.0,210.56
     Sure, let's bring it this way and we'll be careful Bob. So anyway what you're going to do is you're going to go ahead and slump.
},
{
    211.52,217.2
     Round the back. I'm sitting on my sacrum as they call it. So now right away in this position
},
{
    217.2,220.16
     now you're going to go ahead and straighten the leg and pull the toe toward you.
},
{
    221.12,228.56
     And this is kind of like the same as a straight leg rest test and if you start getting pain up in the back or pain all the way down the leg it's kind of
},
{
    228.56,232.92
     that's kind of somewhat positive if you even do this bring the head down and it
},
{
    232.92,237.0
     gets worse right that's even more of a sign that it might be somewhere along
},
{
    237.0,240.8
     your spinal cord on the dura it's getting pushed and there's getting
},
{
    240.8,244.56
     some pain so it may be a herniated disc right so those are the three quick test
},
{
    244.56,245.2
     bread why don't we talk about some of the things that you're typically gonna And there's getting some pain so it may be a herniated disc, right? So those are the three quick tests Brad
},
{
    249.52,250.32
     Why don't we talk about some of the things that you're typically going to feel when you have a herniated disc?
},
{
    252.32,253.12
     some of the symptoms
},
{
    255.12,255.2
     Classic symptom number one
},
{
    261.44,263.24
     You're going to have pain numbness and tingling sensations below the knee down into the foot A lot of times you can get pain
},
{
    263.92,266.48
     Going down the back of your leg to the knee
},
{
    266.48,270.4
     and it's not necessarily a herniated disc. There's a lot of other back problems that'll give you pain
},
{
    270.4,276.0
     that far. But once you start going below the knee, that's a pretty good sign. You've got sciatica or
},
{
    276.0,282.64
     herniated disc. The other thing is typically it is on one side, Brad. It's very unusual to go down
},
{
    282.64,285.16
     both legs. If someone says it's going down both legs
},
{
    285.48,291.08
     I'm thinking spinal stenosis or I'm thinking something else that that is not typical at all
},
{
    291.72,294.22
     Unusual so it's typically down one leg. Sure
},
{
    295.48,298.04
     We talked about the pins and needles is a numbness pain
},
{
    298.88,304.16
     Also, you can have weakness quite often and that's why we already did that one test if you feel like the leg is weak
},
{
    304.6,309.82
     It's going to be uncomfortable typically to sit longer time, about time periods
},
{
    310.08,315.6
     bending over is very uncomfortable and there also might be a shift you may see the person
},
{
    316.0,318.0
     shifting away from the pain
},
{
    318.0,325.06
     So yeah, the right leg will have the symptoms and their back will be away from that and they walk like this
},
{
    325.06,328.92
     I was just in that situation a few months back with the flare-up
},
{
    329.04,332.32
     Okay, and the final thing and people ask you this
},
{
    332.32,339.72
     You know are you having increased pain when you cough or when you sneeze or when you bear down when you're going to the bathroom
},
{
    339.72,343.52
     Sure, so they ask Laska if you're having trouble with your bowel and bladder
},
{
    343.52,345.9
     That's kind of a specific huge problem
},
{
    345.9,353.18
     With the Kanaekwana, right we have a video on that so so those are some of the things some of the quick tests some of the questions
},
{
    353.18,357.36
     You should ask yourself obviously you need to see your doctor if these things are going on
},
{
    357.36,362.0
     But we thought you know give you a little more knowledge and and you know see what you can do with it
},
{
    362.0,366.4
     You better believe it so remember subscribe to us and we are not professional actors
},
{
    366.4,371.24
     But we are professional therapists and we can help you up from here until you were 102 years old
},
{
    371.24,375.32
     That's right after 100 do it since that's what you're on your own after 100 do it
},
