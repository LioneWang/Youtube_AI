     In this video, I'm going to show you how to get hip pain relief in as little as 30 seconds.
},
{
    4.8,9.76
     And the great part is you can do all of these exercises in the comfort of your own home. Stay tuned.

     Hey everyone, Dr. O here at SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan. If you've seen any of my other videos,
},
{
    20.08,24.0
     you know I like to keep things simple and straightforward. And in this video, we're going
},
{
    24.0,26.96
     to do a very simple and straightforward exercise
},
{
    26.96,32.68
     That's going to put more rotation more range of motion into the hip capsule primarily internal rotation
},
{
    32.68,35.68
     And we're going to be doing this using an everyday broomstick
},
{
    35.68,41.76
     If you do not have a broomstick all you need is something that is long and sturdy a PVC pipe
},
{
    41.8,46.12
     You can even go out in the yard and grab a big stick if it works for you.
},
{
    46.12,47.48
     But what we're gonna focus on,
},
{
    47.48,50.02
     get everything moving again into the hip.
},
{
    50.02,51.74
     Get that soft tissue loosened up.
},
{
    51.74,54.04
     Put more rotation in there so you're just able
},
{
    54.04,56.64
     to move around more freely with less pain.
},
{
    56.64,58.16
     Also as an extra benefit,
},
{
    58.16,60.56
     if your back pain is being caused from the hip,
},
{
    60.56,62.92
     this may also help with that.
},
{
    62.92,64.36
     So again, all of these you can do
},
{
    64.36,68.28
     in the comfort of your own home. They're very safe, they're very effective, and hopefully
},
{
    68.28,71.48
     they're going to work for you and give you a lot of hip pain relief. So let's get
},
{
    71.48,74.6
     started with them. So I'm going to show you two different exercises. The first
},
{
    74.6,78.12
     one we're going to be using the broomstick. With the second one, if you
},
{
    78.12,82.32
     were unable to find a broomstick or a PVC pipe, I'm going to show you a way that
},
{
    82.32,88.72
     doesn't require one. But what we're going to do first is lay on a flat surface, in bed, on the floor, whatever
},
{
    88.72,89.96
     works for you.
},
{
    89.96,94.08
     We're going to take the broomstick and I'm going to lift up the leg of the hip that I
},
{
    94.08,96.88
     want to put a little bit more movement in.
},
{
    96.88,102.8
     I go on the outside of the leg and I'm going to take the broomstick and go at it behind
},
{
    102.8,106.52
     the knee and then I'm going to hook the end of it with
},
{
    106.52,107.52
     my foot.
},
{
    107.52,110.04
     So you can kind of see just like that how I'm hooking it.
},
{
    110.04,113.32
     And I want to kind of push it forward a little bit so the end of the stick right here is
},
{
    113.32,115.24
     not going to whack me in the face.
},
{
    115.24,119.96
     I bring the knee up at about 90 degrees and then from there what I'm going to do is just
},
{
    119.96,126.2
     push into the end of the handle right here and then I'm going to go to the opposite way.
},
{
    126.2,132.6
     When you do this, you're going to have a great amount of control into that hip.
},
{
    132.6,135.6
     I tell you what, this feels fantastic.
},
{
    135.6,139.08
     It's a great stretch into the hip.
},
{
    139.08,144.48
     When you do this, go inwards with it like this to a point where it's a great stretch.
},
{
    144.48,147.1
     You want to hold that for 15 seconds.
},
{
    147.1,149.1
     Then you're just going to relax.
},
{
    149.1,151.3
     You're then going to go outwards with it.
},
{
    151.3,156.0
     And then again, to your comfort level, hold that for 10 to 15 seconds.
},
{
    156.0,158.9
     Come back and then repeat that process.
},
{
    158.9,162.8
     You want to do this for about 5 repetitions.
},
{
    162.8,168.6
     And I tell you what, after you're done, switch to the other side, repeat that process, get
},
{
    168.6,174.64
     back up off of the floor or out of the bed and feel how those hips are moving.
},
{
    174.64,179.72
     I probably would say that it's going to help quite a bit at just building a lot more motion
},
{
    179.72,182.96
     in there, getting a lot of pain relief out very quickly.
},
{
    182.96,184.12
     Give that one a try.
},
{
    184.12,188.96
     Let's move on to the second exercise. So if you don't have a broomstick or you just
},
{
    188.96,192.84
     felt like it was irritating your shin or just didn't agree with you, here's a
},
{
    192.84,197.36
     different way to be able to get internal rotation to stretch into the hip. What
},
{
    197.36,201.72
     I'm going to do is I'm going to put one leg up over the other where the inside
},
{
    201.72,205.4
     of the ankle right here is going to be right at the outside of
},
{
    205.4,207.16
     the other leg's knee.
},
{
    207.16,212.84
     What I'm going to do is use this leg, the strength of this leg, to rotate it away.
},
{
    212.84,216.12
     So I'm going to pull it just like this.
},
{
    216.12,218.72
     I tell you what, you're going to feel a very good stretch.
},
{
    218.72,221.04
     Where I'm feeling it is right there in that hip.
},
{
    221.04,230.68
     Actually, I'm feeling in the glutes, the buttocks, all the way up to the lower back. When I do this, I'm really going to try to keep the back as neutral as possible.
},
{
    230.68,232.6
     You really don't want to crank on it too much.
},
{
    232.6,238.2
     You want to try to keep the butt, the hips, pretty well flat on the floor or in bed.
},
{
    238.2,243.04
     Once you get to a point where it's a very good stretch, again, hold 10 to 15 seconds,
},
{
    243.04,249.96
     just come back up to the starting point, and then repeat that three to five times switch to the other side and show that
},
{
    249.96,253.44
     one a little bit of a stretch too but give these a try I hope that they really
},
{
    253.44,258.0
     help with relieving some hip pain possibly even low back pain. So if you
