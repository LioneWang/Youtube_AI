{
    70.8,73.68
     For those of you impatient people with,
},
{
    73.68,77.0
     don't like old men babbling about this and that.
},
{
    78.16,79.8
     All right, I'm gonna talk now, Brad.
},
{
    79.8,82.16
     Oh yeah, that's a whole, the shoulder problem.
},
{
    82.16,86.7
     So, right, there's, we've discovered these over the last few years
},
{
    86.7,89.56
     and from researching and actually working with it
},
{
    89.56,91.34
     with our patients and of course ourselves.
},
{
    91.34,92.18
     And we were-
},
{
    92.18,93.02
     Myself?
},
{
    93.02,95.1
     Yeah, Brad, I just grabbed this discussion.
},
{
    95.1,96.22
     I tried everything.
},
{
    96.22,99.2
     I tried everything I knew and my shoulder pain
},
{
    99.2,101.46
     wasn't going away until I did a couple of these.
},
{
    101.46,103.82
     Okay, now I wanna go to the next point.
},
{
    103.82,105.36
     Is this is the first one?
},
{
    105.36,106.2
     Right.
},
{
    106.2,107.28
     Is this book, which we did,
},
{
    107.28,110.08
     we got this book referred by a viewer.
},
{
    110.08,110.92
     Yes.
},
{
    110.92,112.56
     Wrote a comment, they said this book is.
},
{
    112.56,113.4
     We listened.
},
{
    113.4,115.68
     So Bob took the initiative, ordered it.
},
{
    115.68,118.6
     We both read the book and we're both self-treat
},
{
    118.6,119.92
     and treat our patients with this.
},
{
    119.92,121.88
     First, very skeptical, wouldn't you say?
},
{
    121.88,122.84
     Oh, absolutely.
},
{
    122.84,124.68
     I was like, I wasn't buying it.
},
{
    124.68,126.4
     Yeah. I was like, that doesn't make sense to me.
},
{
    126.4,128.44
     It made a little sense, but I mean,
},
{
    128.44,129.48
     didn't think it would work.
},
{
    129.48,131.36
     So it's simply hanging.
},
{
    131.36,132.96
     You hang from a pull-up bar.
},
{
    132.96,134.08
     He calls it brachyating.
},
{
    134.08,137.88
     And this is from Dr. John Kersh,
},
{
    137.88,139.4
     who's an orthopedic surgeon.
},
{
    139.4,141.92
     And he's actually from 30 miles from my hometown,
},
{
    141.92,143.44
     which I thought was kind of neat.
},
{
    143.44,146.6
     Yeah, great minds apparently call us in the same area.
},
{
    146.6,148.72
     Yeah, they go, it's a Wisconsin thing.
},
{
    148.72,150.6
     Anyway, so we're gonna go through,
},
{
    150.6,153.24
     if you have impingement, the break,
},
{
    153.24,157.94
     aiding the hanging actually helps take the caracal,
},
{
    157.94,161.88
     the chromio-caracal ligament and stretches that
},
{
    161.88,165.24
     and opens up the space so you don't have that impingement.
},
{
    165.24,167.48
     So you just go to a pull-up bar like this
},
{
    167.48,169.64
     and we have an option if you don't have a pull-up bar.
},
{
    169.64,172.12
     So just hold on for another minute or two.
},
{
    172.12,174.72
     And I just started doing this one again
},
{
    174.72,176.94
     because my shoulders bother me from swimming.
},
{
    176.94,179.12
     I didn't have my pull-up bar in my basement.
},
{
    179.12,180.2
     There's a long story to that.
},
{
    180.2,183.92
     So I put it up last week and this is all I do.
},
{
    183.92,186.44
     And it's also can be good for your back as well.
},
{
    186.44,187.28
     Put some traction.
},
{
    187.28,189.32
     And you don't even need to lift up your legs.
},
{
    189.32,191.42
     You're up on your toes.
},
{
    191.42,193.48
     No, I mean I can, but I don't need to.
},
{
    193.48,195.6
     And it can be rough on your hands.
},
{
    195.6,198.52
     And so he would recommend a lot of times wearing gloves.
},
{
    198.52,200.2
     Right, yes.
},
{
    200.2,202.4
     I typically hang for 10 to 15 seconds.
},
{
    202.4,204.96
     I think in the book he recommends up to 30 seconds.
},
{
    204.96,207.84
     My hands get sore and I find that I do fine.
},
{
    207.84,209.84
     But then I do that three repetitions.
},
{
    209.84,212.48
     I relax, do some exercises, then I come back
},
{
    212.48,216.4
     and I involve it with my whole routine, with my banding.
},
{
    216.4,220.0
     So that's a simple exercise.
},
{
    220.0,221.16
     Shall we go on to-
},
{
    221.16,222.0
     Then the next one, yeah.
},
{
    222.0,223.4
     I thought you, weren't you gonna use the chair?
},
{
    223.4,227.14
     Well, of course, but we're gonna use the Buya stick.
},
{
    227.14,230.44
     You can use anything that's about four or five feet long.
},
{
    230.44,231.76
     I thought the Buya.
},
{
    231.76,232.6
     Oh yeah.
},
{
    232.6,233.42
     Buya!
},
{
    233.42,235.26
     Buya!
},
{
    235.26,238.36
     Okay, all right, now we're happy.
},
{
    238.36,239.64
     Just a little thing we do for fun.
},
{
    239.64,241.92
     You don't have to do that as part of the treatment.
},
{
    241.92,244.04
     But you take the stick, you wanna do it standing
},
{
    244.04,246.0
     because you can do the standing or seated.
},
{
    246.0,247.32
     Well, you're talking about this way?
},
{
    247.32,249.76
     No, no, no, this is a Statue of Liberty.
},
{
    249.76,251.92
     I know, but so I have to sit down
},
{
    251.92,252.88
     or get on my knees, you mean?
},
{
    252.88,253.88
     No, no, no, you do it here.
},
{
    253.88,255.4
     Remember how we...
},
{
    255.4,256.92
     Oh, I know, yeah, okay.
},
{
    256.92,259.08
     I thought I was gonna do it sitting on this thing, but yeah.
},
{
    259.08,260.32
     Good thing we rehearsed this one.
},
{
    260.32,262.52
     Yeah, that's right, we're really wanting to go here.
},
{
    262.52,264.84
     So you can do the standing or sitting.
},
{
    264.84,266.24
     You can find a countertop.
},
{
    266.24,268.6
     Yep, and if you don't have a Booyah stick,
},
{
    268.6,271.48
     use a stick that you can grab good.
},
{
    271.48,273.08
     Like a broomstick or a...
},
{
    273.08,274.64
     Yeah, and it can't slip though.
},
{
    274.64,277.76
     If it slips around, do something so it doesn't slip.
},
{
    277.76,279.96
     And you reach up as high as you can,
},
{
    280.98,284.36
     and then you get a good grip on what you're on the stick,
},
{
    284.36,288.4
     and you simply lean forward and it stretches the arm
},
{
    288.4,292.34
     just like it does when you're hanging on the pull-up bar.
},
{
    292.34,293.22
     Then you're just doing one.
},
{
    293.22,295.66
     I don't think it works as good as a pull-up bar,
},
{
    295.66,297.42
     but if you don't have one, it's...
},
{
    297.42,298.66
     I think it works pretty well.
},
{
    298.66,300.26
     I do this every morning.
},
{
    300.26,301.7
     Do you know when I do it, Brad?
},
{
    301.7,302.98
     I did it this morning.
},
{
    302.98,306.32
     I stretch my calf muscles on the steps.
},
{
    306.32,308.8
     I put these on the steps above me.
},
{
    308.8,310.64
     And I stretch like this while I'm stretching
},
{
    310.64,312.2
     my calf muscles for my run.
},
{
    312.2,314.64
     So that would be like doing two things at the same time.
},
{
    314.64,315.48
     I've been doing that.
},
{
    315.48,317.24
     I've been doing double stretches on things.
},
{
    317.24,319.92
     And just, so I'm, you know, I stretch the one calf,
},
{
    319.92,322.36
     I stretch the other calf, I stretch both calves.
},
{
    322.36,324.16
     And meanwhile, I've stretched the shoulder out
},
{
    324.16,325.1
     by the time I'm done.
},
{
    325.1,326.34
     So look at that.
},
{
    326.34,328.88
     We've got options there.
},
{
    328.88,331.56
     So typically you're gonna hold up to 30 seconds
},
{
    331.56,333.28
     and do that about three repetitions.
},
{
    333.28,336.12
     And you do this, all of these are gonna do daily.
},
{
    336.12,339.8
     If it hurts your shoulder, if it creates pain,
},
{
    339.8,341.4
     it may not be ready for it,
},
{
    341.4,343.28
     or you may have a different diagnosis
},
{
    343.28,344.48
     and then stop doing it.
},
{
    344.48,345.0
     Don't kill your arm. This is not something that we're different diagnosis, and then stop doing it and don't care.
},
{
    345.0,346.96
     This is not something that we're doing
},
{
    346.96,348.24
     that no pain, no gain.
},
{
    348.24,349.76
     You don't want to have,
},
{
    349.76,352.2
     I mean, you can have some stretching discomfort,
},
{
    352.2,353.92
     maybe a little bit, but wait,
},
{
    353.92,355.4
     am I showing the chicken wing right now?
},
{
    355.4,356.24
     Oh yeah.
},
{
    356.24,358.8
     So the other thing, just a hint,
},
{
    358.8,362.48
     impingement, typically symptoms are,
},
{
    362.48,364.76
     it's pain-free down here,
},
{
    364.76,367.76
     but when you start to lift your arm up to around 90 degrees
},
{
    367.76,370.44
     or up higher, then it hurts.
},
{
    370.44,373.28
     Sometimes it'll all hurt, and once you get up here,
},
{
    373.28,374.12
     then it doesn't hurt anymore.
},
{
    374.12,375.96
     It can be a painful arc as we call it,
},
{
    375.96,377.84
     or it can be painful at the end.
},
{
    377.84,378.68
     Right.
},
{
    378.68,379.52
     So.
},
{
    379.52,382.56
     If you wanna do a test, we do have some really good videos
},
{
    382.56,384.64
     on how to test for shoulder and pain.
},
{
    384.64,386.16
     Very common, by the way.
},
{
    386.16,388.92
     I mean, I would say the vast majority of patients I see,
},
{
    388.92,391.32
     80%, probably have some form of this.
},
{
    391.32,394.44
     And that's cited in Dr. Kirsch's book as well.
},
{
    394.44,395.28
     Is it really?
},
{
    395.28,396.12
     Yeah.
},
{
    396.12,396.96
     He concurs.
},
{
    396.96,397.8
     He concurs.
},
{
    397.8,398.84
     Okay, so I'm going to show you the chicken wing.
},
{
    398.84,399.68
     Oh, yes.
},
{
    399.68,403.68
     So with this one, and what you're going to do,
},
{
    403.68,405.84
     you need a pole or a stick.
},
{
    405.84,407.44
     I'll show it from this direction.
},
{
    407.44,412.2
     Okay, and the upper arm, that's the good arm.
},
{
    412.2,413.04
     Yep.
},
{
    413.04,415.2
     Okay, and the palm is down or forward.
},
{
    415.2,417.08
     So I'm just pointing down towards the floor,
},
{
    417.08,419.36
     or whichever way you wanna think about it.
},
{
    419.36,422.28
     On the bottom arm, the palm is pointed out.
},
{
    424.0,426.08
     And this is the shoulder retreating,
},
{
    426.08,427.76
     the one, the bottom one.
},
{
    427.76,430.96
     Now first you might, the first couple of days
},
{
    430.96,433.66
     you might just do internal rotation like this,
},
{
    433.66,435.56
     bringing it up and down.
},
{
    435.56,436.84
     You know, you're bringing the arm up.
},
{
    436.84,438.8
     But then eventually what you wanna do is bring it up
},
{
    438.8,441.08
     and actually stretch it out this way too.
},
{
    442.56,445.16
     And you gotta watch out for your head.
},
{
    445.16,447.72
     You gotta go to the side of the head here.
},
{
    447.72,450.88
     But I just do pressure on, pressure off.
},
{
    450.88,453.34
     Pressure on, pressure off.
},
{
    453.34,456.4
     And again, I think this was a miracle, Brad.
},
{
    456.4,460.04
     I mean, it was just such an irritating pain.
},
{
    460.04,462.44
     It was getting to the point it was hurting all the time.
},
{
    462.44,465.96
     But when you did this, it didn't make it hurt.
},
{
    465.96,467.56
     It felt like just a stretch.
},
{
    467.56,468.72
     It just felt like a stretch.
},
{
    468.72,469.56
     Right, it did not hurt.
},
{
    469.56,472.28
     It's important that you get that kind of a response.
},
{
    472.28,473.6
     I get the sense Brad,
},
{
    473.6,476.36
     that you don't believe in this exercise as much as I do.
},
{
    476.36,477.48
     But you know, again.
},
{
    477.48,480.4
     Because we're actually, you know,
},
{
    480.4,482.16
     it's not like Bob invented this.
},
{
    482.16,485.68
     You got it from a combination from two famous therapists,
},
{
    485.68,488.04
     from Mackenzie and...
},
{
    488.04,489.04
     Well, Balegas.
},
{
    489.04,490.08
     Yeah, sure.
},
{
    490.08,491.12
     So.
},
{
    491.12,491.96
     All right.
},
{
    491.96,495.92
     And now we're gonna go to the old strengthening exercises
},
{
    495.92,498.56
     that this has been going on in physical therapy
},
{
    498.56,500.76
     for as long as it's been physical therapy, I believe.
},
{
    500.76,501.6
     Yep.
},
{
    501.6,504.08
     And you wanna, you know, this is to help maintain
},
{
    504.08,505.04
     and keep you out of trouble.
},
{
    505.04,505.88
     Did you want this yet?
},
{
    505.88,508.8
     Yeah, we're gonna use, do some rotator cuff strengthening
},
{
    508.8,510.28
     of the posterior muscles,
},
{
    510.28,512.92
     which help keep that, the caudal glider,
},
{
    512.92,515.2
     that humor head down so you avoid
},
{
    515.2,517.04
     that impingement of the tendon.
},
{
    517.04,519.4
     We should mention Brad, this is what we're giving away.
},
{
    519.4,520.24
     Oh yeah.
},
{
    520.24,522.72
     We're giving away, these are the clips that go on the wall.
},
{
    522.72,524.8
     This is the wall anchor.
},
{
    524.8,526.24
     You get four of them when you buy it,
},
{
    526.24,527.28
     go from our website.
},
{
    527.28,529.0
     We invented it.
},
{
    529.0,530.64
     We were definitely looking for something
},
{
    530.64,534.2
     to easily attach, you know, the bands,
},
{
    534.2,536.42
     the exercise bands and...
},
{
    536.42,538.2
     So that's about as easy as you can get.
},
{
    538.2,540.12
     But there's a whole bunch of variations you can do
},
{
    540.12,542.56
     so it doesn't slide through and anyway.
},
{
    542.56,544.32
     So this is how you're gonna do it.
},
{
    544.32,546.92
     You put a towel here by your elbow
},
{
    546.92,549.44
     and what that does is it keeps your elbow
},
{
    549.44,553.16
     in the proper position so you get the proper mechanics.
},
{
    553.16,555.32
     And he's got a right angle here.
},
{
    555.32,557.84
     And he's not breaking that yet, he's not going up.
},
{
    557.84,560.4
     It's not this, and it's not this.
},
{
    560.4,563.0
     If the towel drops, that means your elbow went too far away
},
{
    563.0,564.36
     from your ribs, can you believe?
},
{
    564.36,565.5
     The flying elbow.
},
{
    565.5,566.38
     Yes.
},
{
    566.38,569.4
     So as a here, and you're gonna do 10 of these.
},
{
    569.4,572.14
     And then after you get done with 10 of those,
},
{
    572.14,575.62
     you're gonna do the last exercise, the fifth one,
},
{
    575.62,577.66
     scapular retraction.
},
{
    577.66,580.56
     So what he's doing here, you can see the shoulder blades
},
{
    580.56,583.9
     are coming together, a great postural exercise.
},
{
    583.9,587.92
     You're establishing the muscle base for the shoulder.
},
{
    587.92,590.4
     Because if this is winging on you,
},
{
    590.4,593.04
     the shoulder is not gonna be stable.
},
{
    593.04,595.64
     And it's gonna impinge a lot easier.
},
{
    595.64,599.48
     So posture is really important even with shoulders.
},
{
    599.48,602.24
     In fact, especially with shoulders.
},
{
    602.24,607.2
     So you really wanna make sure that your base is established.
},
{
    607.32,609.64
     So, and you don't have to have that towel in there.
},
{
    609.64,611.56
     Once you get the mechanics right,
},
{
    611.56,615.12
     you can do 10 of these, let it rest a little bit.
},
{
    615.12,617.52
     Then I have my patients go right to 10 of these
},
{
    617.52,619.96
     and I say, put your hands down into your,
},
{
    619.96,621.84
     like you're putting your hands in your pocket
},
{
    621.84,624.72
     and tell them the visual about where the scapulas go.
},
{
    624.72,625.56
     Where do you do?
},
{
    625.56,627.4
     Well, the idea of what you think about
},
{
    627.4,630.8
     is that the shoulder blades are actually going down
},
{
    630.8,632.56
     and in the opposite pocket.
},
{
    633.48,635.36
     And now, obviously you can't do that,
},
{
    635.36,637.24
     but that's what you wanna think.
},
{
    637.24,639.12
     It just kind of gives you the visual
},
{
    639.12,640.88
     of where you want those blades going.
},
{
    640.88,643.52
     That way the right muscles contract and you get the-
},
{
    643.52,644.36
     They're working.
},
{
    644.36,646.0
     Yeah, most efficient.
},
{
    646.0,648.8
     And then I do like to say three sets of 10 of these
},
{
    648.8,649.64
     with my patients.
},
{
    649.64,653.76
     So 10 here, 10 here, I'm not gonna go through them.
},
{
    653.76,656.52
     And then that would be one set and you do three sets.
},
{
    656.52,657.36
     Are you tired Liz?
},
{
    657.36,659.48
     No, you literally, you can,
},
{
    659.48,661.64
     you probably don't have to do that every day.
},
{
    661.64,662.48
     You could.
},
{
    662.48,663.32
     Right.
},
{
    663.32,665.28
     But if you got that in three, four days a week,
},
{
    665.28,666.12
     you'd be doing well.
},
{
    666.12,668.12
     So there's five of them.
},
{
    668.12,670.44
     We don't recommend you do all five of them.
},
{
    670.44,675.32
     Do the ones that give the best symptom relief.
},
{
    675.32,676.64
     Let's put it that way.
},
{
    676.64,679.0
     If you do one and it just hurts it,
},
{
    679.0,681.92
     and if you're really flared up,
},
{
    681.92,684.24
     you may have to put cold packs on it
},
{
    684.24,685.98
     and do the Codman's exercise,
},
{
    685.98,687.4
     which we have a video coming up,
},
{
    687.4,688.56
     I think tomorrow on that one.
},
{
    688.56,689.9
     Is that when it's coming up?
},
{
    689.9,691.1
     Coming up pretty soon.
},
{
    691.1,692.24
     All right.
},
{
    692.24,694.46
     Well, by the time this one comes up,
},
{
    694.46,695.46
     it'll be up already.
},
{
    695.46,697.18
     Oh, that's right.
},
{
    697.18,698.78
     All right, Brad, I'm gonna give a golf lesson now.
},
{
    698.78,700.98
     So you keep the towel underneath the arm like this.
},
{
    700.98,701.82
     Why, Bob?
},
{
    701.82,703.18
     You don't want the towel to drop.
},
{
    703.18,704.66
     You wanna keep it connected to the body.
},
{
    704.66,706.12
     This is not one of the five.
},
{
    706.12,707.32
     All right.
},
{
    707.32,708.92
     Thanks everybody for watching.
},
