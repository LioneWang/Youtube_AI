     In this video, I'm going to show you how to use eye drops properly.
},
{
    3.44,7.28
     Many of my patients every day use eye drops on a regular basis, and if you end up missing
},
{
    7.28,11.56
     and it just ends up on the eyelid, then you end up wasting your precious eye drops.
},
{
    11.56,15.72
     So I'm going to walk you through the proper steps on how to use eye drops, and I'll share
},
{
    15.72,19.72
     some pro tips that'll make it a lot easier and may even save you some money.
},
{
    19.72,22.96
     Plus if you're somebody who blinks a lot or flinches due to the eye drops coming in, or
},
{
    22.96,27.84
     maybe you have a child who can't stand using eye drops, then I'll even share a smart way to getting eye drops
},
{
    27.84,30.08
     in even with the eyes closed.
},
{
    30.08,31.08
     Now let's take a look.
},

    31.08,32.08

     dry eyes, red eyes or itchy eyes. If you want to check out the full series, I'll put a link
},
{
    60.44,63.8
     to that in the video description below so you can find it easily. Now let's go over
},
{
    63.8,65.4
     how to apply eye drops easily
},
{
    65.4,66.72
     and without missing.
},
{
    66.72,68.5
     Step one is to always wash your hands.
},
{
    68.5,70.28
     You can be touching around your eyes
},
{
    70.28,72.68
     and you don't wanna possibly give yourself an infection.
},
{
    72.68,74.32
     Step two is to check the side of the bottle
},
{
    74.32,76.2
     or the box for an expiration date.
},
{
    76.2,78.4
     If it is expired, then it's best not to use it.
},
{
    78.4,81.04
     Otherwise, the active ingredients aren't gonna be working
},
{
    81.04,83.14
     and you end up just getting more side effects
},
{
    83.14,85.76
     and possibly cause a burn or irritation to the eye.
},
{
    85.76,89.16
     Step three is going to be shaking the bottle for about 10 seconds.
},
{
    89.16,93.0
     That's going to mix around the ingredients and improve the effectiveness of many eye
},
{
    93.0,94.0
     drop medications.
},
{
    94.0,98.46
     Now step four is to remove the cap of the bottle and place the cap on a clean surface
},
{
    98.46,102.96
     such as a clean tissue paper or paper towel, someplace where it's not going to contaminate
},
{
    102.96,103.96
     the top.
},
{
    103.96,107.44
     Plus a pro tip here is to observe the tip of the bottle for any coloration change
},
{
    107.44,111.6
     because that could be a sign of contamination and you don't want to be using those drops.
},
{
    111.6,115.6
     Now step five here is going to be really important and that is to use your fingertips
},
{
    115.6,120.4
     to hold down the lower eyelid that you're going to be administering the drops in.
},
{
    120.4,125.56
     I prefer to use my non-dominant hand to hold that lower eyelid down and that creates a
},
{
    125.56,130.62
     little pocket that essentially increases the target size for the eyedrops to get in the
},
{
    130.62,131.62
     eye.
},
{
    131.62,134.6
     And it's usually best to get your fingertips right to the eyelid margin as that's going
},
{
    134.6,136.92
     to create a larger eyelid pocket.
},
{
    136.92,140.12
     And now step six is while you're holding your lower eyelid down, you're going to lift your
},
{
    140.12,142.92
     chin and your gaze up toward the ceiling.
},
{
    142.92,145.2
     And with your dominant hand holding the eyedropper,
},
{
    145.2,150.48
     you're going to place a single eyedrop into the eye. Now it's important not to touch the dropper
},
{
    150.48,155.28
     to the eye or the eyelid because that could cause a contamination to the dropper. And another pro
},
{
    155.28,159.92
     tip is to not free float your arm up in the air because then it's going to be harder for you to
},
{
    159.92,164.64
     hit that target of your eye. Instead what I like to do is rest my dominant hand on the back of the
},
{
    164.64,166.32
     hand that's holding the eyelid.
},
{
    166.32,168.96
     That way I can position it just at the right height.
},
{
    168.96,170.92
     Another key and important pro tip here
},
{
    170.92,173.64
     is to only use a single drop at a time.
},
{
    173.64,176.48
     Using more drops than one isn't gonna improve
},
{
    176.48,177.88
     the effectiveness of the drop.
},
{
    177.88,179.92
     Instead, it's just gonna waste the drops
},
{
    179.92,182.88
     and it may increase your chances of side effects.
},
{
    182.88,184.92
     Step seven is that after you've gotten the eye drop in,
},
{
    184.92,187.68
     try to keep your eyelids closed without blinking.
},
{
    187.68,190.08
     Keeping the eyelids closed will keep that medication
},
{
    190.08,192.8
     to the eye and improve its effectiveness.
},
{
    192.8,195.0
     If you blink several times, all that's gonna happen
},
{
    195.0,198.12
     is gonna flush those drops through the drainage canal
},
{
    198.12,200.2
     of the eye down to your nasal cavity.
},
{
    200.2,201.68
     And the pro tip here is that you can even do
},
{
    201.68,204.28
     punctal occlusion, where you use your fingers
},
{
    204.28,206.96
     to block the drainage canals of the eye.
},
{
    206.96,210.32
     If you feel right between your nose, you can feel these little bumps right there, that's
},
{
    210.32,211.64
     the drainage canal.
},
{
    211.64,215.36
     And so if you block that, for about those 30 seconds with your eyelids closed, that's
},
{
    215.36,219.52
     going to further reduce any of the drainage of those drops through the drainage canal
},
{
    219.52,223.96
     and even helps prevent systemic absorption and potential side effects.
},
{
    223.96,225.04
     After that, you can wipe away any
},
{
    225.04,229.84
     excess drops from your eyelid with a clean tissue and then recap your bottle. Now if you happen to
},
{
    229.84,234.0
     be someone who has a really hard time getting eye drops in because you're always blinking or flinching
},
{
    234.0,237.92
     or maybe you have a young child who has a hard time with eye drops, there is a smart way of how
},
{
    237.92,242.56
     to put in eye drops without flinching. So let's go over that now. Now in the eye clinic, if somebody
},
{
    242.56,249.4
     is having a hard time getting drops in, we usually ask them to close their eyes so that way they don't have to see the drop coming toward them, and
},
{
    249.4,251.4
     then they look up toward the ceiling.
},
{
    251.4,254.52
     You can alternatively also do this while laying down.
},
{
    254.52,257.2
     And then you can either put the drop in yourself or have a friend do it, but you're going to
},
{
    257.2,261.8
     put a single drop right into the corner of the eye by your nose.
},
{
    261.8,269.64
     Once the eye drop is in the corner, you simply open your eyes and then you will feel the eyedrop apply itself to the surface of the entire eye. After that you can then again close
},
{
    269.64,274.4
     your eyes and puncture a clue for about 30 seconds. If you are applying the eyedrop to yourself in
},
{
    274.4,279.4
     this manner, it's important to first align the eyedrops over the eye so you get it in the correct
},
{
    279.4,283.92
     position and not onto your eyelid. A cool way you can do that is to just rest the bottle slightly
},
{
    283.92,285.08
     on the bridge of your nose
},
{
    285.08,287.24
     so you can actually see the front edge of the tip.
},
{
    287.24,289.6
     And then you just tilt it slightly down, close your eyes,
},
{
    289.6,291.12
     and the drop should fall right in.
},
{
    291.12,293.08
     Now there's a few extra pro tips about eyedrops
},
{
    293.08,295.04
     that I wanted to share just because I believe
},
{
    295.04,296.12
     they're gonna help you out.
},
{
    296.12,297.8
     The first one is that if you are using
},
{
    297.8,300.12
     multiple different eyedrop medications,
},
{
    300.12,303.66
     you wanna space those out by about five to 10 minutes.
},
{
    303.66,308.56
     Otherwise, if you use too many at a time, you could end up flushing out the previous eyedrop.
},
{
    308.56,313.76
     In addition, if you happen to be using any eyedrop gels or ointments, make sure to use those last.
},
{
    313.76,318.16
     Otherwise, eyedrops that you could be putting in, if you put them in after you put in a gel
},
{
    318.16,321.52
     or ointment, the gel and ointments are just too thick and the drop's not going to get through.
},
{
    321.52,326.56
     Now, if you happen to be a contact lens wearer like myself, it is always best to take out those contact lenses first
},
{
    326.56,328.0
     before putting in any eyedrops
},
{
    328.0,331.56
     unless you were specifically told to do so by your eye doctor.
},
{
    331.56,334.72
     They do make rewetting drops specifically for contact lenses
},
{
    334.72,337.04
     that you can use while you're wearing your contacts.
},
{
    337.04,339.12
     If you want to check out some of my favorite eyedrops
},
{
    339.12,341.32
     that work with contact lenses, I have a video on that
},
{
    341.32,343.7
     and I'll put a link up to that here in the YouTube card above
},
{
    343.7,345.76
     as well as in the video description below, again so you can find
},
{
    345.76,349.18
     it easily. Another cool tip is that if you're somebody who's just not ever sure
},
{
    349.18,353.4
     if you got the drop into your eye, then you can try refrigerating those eye drops
},
{
    353.4,356.4
     because that'll give it kind of a cooling effect and make it more obvious
},
{
    356.4,359.48
     when you've gotten it in. If you're not sure if your eye drop can be refrigerated,
},
{
    359.48,362.92
     always just ask your eye care provider or your pharmacist for more information.
},
{
    362.92,365.96
     Now another cool thing I've been sharing is that of Nanodropper.
},
{
    365.96,371.04
     This is a special topper that screws onto your eyedrops and reduces the amount of liquid
},
{
    371.04,374.24
     coming out of the dropper by up to 70%.
},
{
    374.24,378.04
     This is really important I think for anybody who uses eyedrops on a regular basis like
},
{
    378.04,382.88
     day to day, especially for someone with glaucoma whose medications can get quite expensive.
},
{
    382.88,385.12
     With Nanodropper you still get the same effectiveness
},
{
    385.12,387.56
     of your eyedrop, you just are reducing the waste
},
{
    387.56,389.96
     by up to 70%, which can ultimately save you
},
{
    389.96,391.88
     a lot of money on your eyedrop medications.
},
{
    391.88,393.24
     If you want to check out Nanodropper yourself,
},
{
    393.24,394.66
