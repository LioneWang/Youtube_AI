     Let's get started.
},
{
    119.12,126.0
     Spondylolisthesis is the result of advanced degenerative disease. It's a condition that deaths degenerate
},
{
    126.0,129.0
     and resulting in loss of death.
},
{
    129.0,132.0
     This condition, causing instability
},
{
    132.0,136.0
     and one vertebra to sleep forward over another one below it.
},
{
    136.0,139.0
     Other cause of spondylolisthesis
},
{
    139.0,144.0
     would be stress fracture or congenital abnormalities.
},
{
    144.0,146.48
     There are some rare causes
},
{
    146.48,153.0
     such as tumor and trauma. Degenerative spondylolisthesis is a consequence of
},
{
    153.0,158.56
     aging process in which the bone joints and the ligaments in the spine grow
},
{
    158.56,164.96
     weakened and become less able to maintain the alignment of the spine.
},
{
    168.16,175.28
     less able to maintain the alignment of the spine. This type of spondylolisthesis typically occur at one of two levels of lumbar spine, L3L4
},
{
    175.28,182.84
     or L4L5, which is the most common one.
},
{
    182.84,189.6
     The generative spondylolisthesis is more common in people over age of 50 and in particular
},
{
    189.6,196.28
     among individuals over age 65.
},
{
    196.28,200.6
     Women are 2-3 times as likely as men to be diagnosed.
},
{
    200.6,207.2
     Spondylolisthesis can cause impingement of the nerve and fatigue of the back muscles and may result
},
{
    207.2,208.8
     lower back and leg pain.
},
{
    213.2,217.6
     The symptoms of spondylolisthesis may be lower back and leg pain,
},
{
    218.88,227.0
     sciatica, an aching pain in the hip, buttocks and lower back that radiate into back of the thighs and the legs
},
{
    227.0,236.0
     a shuffling gait when walking or weakness in the lower extremity or abnormal posture
},
{
    236.0,246.2
     if you experience any of these symptoms we would recommend you to visit your physical therapist and ask them for advice.
},
{
    248.2,253.16
     After correct diagnosis of espondylolisthesis, your physical
},
{
    253.16,258.44
     therapist will recommend you a treatment plan which is included physical
},
{
    258.44,267.2
     therapy and strengthening exercises. You may rest and restrict certain type of activity to minimize
},
{
    267.2,272.24
     your pain in that period of time. Injection sometimes would help with
},
{
    272.24,278.2
     reduce the pain and swelling and you may take some medication and analgesic to
},
{
    278.2,282.2
     reduce pain and swelling. The first exercise that I'm going to show you guys
},
{
    282.2,286.72
     we're trying to improve the mobility in our lower spine,
},
{
    286.72,290.04
     which we call posterior tilt of your pelvis.
},
{
    290.04,292.76
     I'm gonna show you how to do it, you can give it a try.
},
{
    292.76,295.72
     You're gonna lie on your back, you can use a pillow,
},
{
    295.72,297.72
     if that feels more comfortable,
},
{
    297.72,301.0
     we're trying to push our spine down to the ground,
},
{
    301.0,302.92
     which means with that movement,
},
{
    302.92,308.24
     it creates a posterior tilt in our spine and our hip.
},
{
    309.04,315.84
     I'm going to put my hands on the knee to my lower back to just feel that pressure from my lower back.
},
{
    316.64,320.4
     If you feel this is uncomfortable initially you've got to be patient,
},
{
    321.04,332.06
     breathe in and out while you're doing it and you're trying to slowly create that movement. I'm trying to look at hold it for five seconds, four, three,
},
{
    332.06,350.08
     two and relax. We're gonna try it one more round, three, two, one and relax. When you repeat this movement,
},
{
    350.08,355.04
     it actually creates more strength and you can actually use those muscles better than
},
{
    355.04,361.2
     where you started. We're going to practice this exercise for three sets of five and we
},
{
    361.2,366.62
     hold it for five seconds. Now from there we're gonna progress this
},
{
    366.62,371.0
     exercise and I'm going to show you in the second move which is we're gonna do
},
{
    371.0,375.36
     something similar to dead bog but it basically we're trying to hold our
},
{
    375.36,381.48
     posterior tilt and create those movement. We're gonna practice this which means we're
},
{
    381.48,386.48
     gonna push the pelvis down posterior posteriorly, hold it there,
},
{
    386.48,389.24
     and we're trying to bring one foot up.
},
{
    390.2,391.28
     Slow down.
},
{
    393.24,394.24
     Back up again.
},
{
    395.2,396.44
     Slow down.
},
{
    396.44,398.96
     Now, the most important part of this exercise
},
{
    398.96,402.04
     is that when you're doing this movement with your leg,
},
{
    402.04,404.6
     you want to keep your lower back,
},
{
    404.6,405.04
     push down
},
{
    405.04,411.76
     to the ground and maintain that stability. I'm gonna show you one more round hold my
},
{
    411.76,417.52
     hands there just for you to understand what we're doing you push it down you
},
{
    417.52,427.0
     bring one legs up slow down while I'm doing this movement, I'm trying to keep my hip and my pelvis down to the
},
{
    427.0,434.96
     ground and not moving. Four and I go one more and five. Now when I got more
},
{
    434.96,451.08
     comfortable with this exercise I try the same thing posterior tilt my pelvis hold it there. I'll bring my arms as well back and forward. Back and forward. While
},
{
    451.08,458.2
     I'm doing this exercise guys my pelvis doesn't shift up, slow control and back.
},
{
    458.2,463.6
     Now you can switch sides. You got to practice this exercise for a while to
},
{
    463.6,470.32
     get better in it and you will be surprised it takes time to actually get to that level.
},
{
    470.32,475.16
     Posterior tilt, bring the legs up, slow down, back up.
},
{
    475.16,481.64
     If you go for five tap, you're going to make sure that you're breathing while you're doing
},
{
    481.64,486.52
     this movement. And I'm going to show you the progression. Bring
},
{
    486.52,495.44
     your foot up and arms at the same times. Back up and relax. Now you can try these
},
{
    495.44,502.08
     exercises for three sets of five. Tap it, slow and control. Don't rush it for the
},
{
    502.08,511.6
     progression for both arms and legs. Be patient, practice the step by step, breathing it out and make sure to not rushing it.
},
{
    511.6,514.8
     Let's move to the next exercise.
},
{
    514.8,519.12
     The next move that I'm going to show you guys is going to be hip bridges or glute bridges.
},
{
    519.12,523.2
     There are so many different ways to call it, but I'm going to show you the version that's
},
{
    523.2,526.52
     suitable for you and you can practice that.
},
{
    526.52,532.36
     We already learned how to posterior tilt our pelvis and we're going to try a similar movement
},
{
    532.36,537.52
     while we're doing our hip bridges, which means you're trying to posterior tilt your pelvis
},
{
    537.52,541.96
     and then go for hip bridge.
},
{
    541.96,549.24
     Posterior tilt the pelvis, hold that and go for hip reach.
},
{
    549.24,553.84
     Posterior tilt pelvis and we're going to go up.
},
{
    553.84,560.24
     Slow control down, tilt pelvis and go up.
},
{
    560.24,562.88
     You can hold at the top for a second, slow down.
},
{
    562.88,565.68
     You can hold the hands on the ground if you feel more comfortable.
},
{
    566.24,569.84
     Back down and hold it there for one second.
},
{
    570.64,572.64
     You're going to go one more round.
},
{
    573.04,575.36
     Posterior tilt pelvis, hold it there.
},
{
    576.4,578.16
     And you're going to go for a breach.
},
{
    578.16,584.24
     You do feel that your glute and your hamstring could actually work while you're doing this exercise.
},
{
    584.24,588.72
     You're going to posterior tilt help pelvis and back up again.
},
{
    588.72,592.08
     Hold it there for one seconds, slow control down.
},
{
    592.08,595.04
     It's a very gentle move guys, it's not very quick.
},
{
    595.04,598.88
     You want to start with three sets of let's say eight to ten.
},
{
    598.88,606.72
     Slowly progress them to fifteen repetition. Your movement is a slow tempo, which means you're trying to create
},
{
    606.72,612.4
     movement of your pelvis initially and push it to top and hold it there for a second.
},
{
    612.4,617.88
     Make sure that your glutes and your hamstrings are working and slowly coming down. Progress
},
{
    617.88,626.48
     them step by step and challenge and see which muscle works. Your glute and hamstring usually will be the primary muscle.
},
{
    626.48,632.6
     One of the main area that feels very stiff and immobile would be around your hip and your lower
},
{
    632.6,638.52
     back. I'm going to show you a very simple stretch that you're going to do in a daily basis while
},
{
    638.52,644.0
     you're doing these exercises. As you can see part of this routine is not necessarily stretch only,
},
{
    644.0,645.48
     it's a mobility,
},
{
    645.48,648.32
     strengthening and stretches at the same times.
},
{
    648.32,651.96
     And I would always suggest my patients to do all of them at the same time.
},
{
    651.96,657.04
     Don't stick to only stretching certain muscle group because stretching is great but it
},
{
    657.04,660.24
     doesn't necessarily strengthen that specific muscle.
},
{
    660.24,666.2
     I'm going to show you how to stretch your hip very gently without aggravating your pain.
},
{
    666.2,668.24
     This is the safest position for you to do.
},
{
    668.24,674.88
     Basically, you're going to lie down on your back and you can use your both arms and hold
},
{
    674.88,676.28
     your knee down to your chest.
},
{
    676.28,681.64
     Now while you're doing this, it creates some sort of posterior tilt for your hip anyway,
},
{
    681.64,683.28
     which is great.
},
{
    683.28,684.8
     That's what we're usually looking for.
},
{
    684.8,687.6
     But if you have issues to holding both knees,
},
{
    687.6,689.76
     you can start initially with one knee.
},
{
    689.76,693.28
     And if you find your knees are sore to hold it from there,
},
{
    693.28,696.42
     you can hold them from underneath of your,
},
{
    696.42,701.34
     basically knee, hold it there, 15 to 20 seconds.
},
{
    701.34,704.34
     Our aim is to get to 30 seconds hold.
},
{
    704.34,707.28
     You're breathing in and out and you can hold
},
{
    707.28,715.04
     one leg and then if you were whenever you felt comfortable you can bring both legs hold them there
},
{
    716.48,732.16
     and if you can hug the knee it would be definitely more stretch on the hip and you can feel it more. You're gonna hold it there for 30 seconds and you can try this for a 3 set to 4 set every day. Now I'm gonna
},
{
    732.16,738.92
     show you if you find this stretch is very easy you can even bring the knee
},
{
    738.92,751.66
     kind of like hip off the ground which means you're bringing a little bit higher and that creates a bit of more posterior tilt on the pelvis and your lower back. This is
},
{
    751.66,755.44
     one of the simplest stretches that you can do while you're doing these
},
{
    755.44,761.5
     exercises. Try it for three to four sets of holding it for 30 seconds. If you find
},
{
    761.5,768.88
     it uncomfortable start with one knee and slowly build it up to holding both knee make sure that you're breathing two exercises and not holding
},
{
    768.88,773.12
     your breath. The last exercise that I'm going to show you today guys it's a very
},
{
    773.12,777.4
     simple stretch for your hamstring. Hamstring is another muscle that you can
},
{
    777.4,781.92
     actually stretch while you're experiencing this condition. It's a very
},
{
    781.92,786.68
     simple exercise you may need a towel or a belt or those
},
{
    786.68,792.44
     stretch and basically pools. You can use anything. Towels are
},
{
    792.44,795.08
     straightforward. I'm going to show you how to do it. You're going to lie down on your
},
{
    795.08,801.04
     back and wrap that kind of like around your foot and what we try to do we try
},
{
    801.04,805.32
     to create that movement while we're doing it, which
},
{
    805.32,808.7
     means you're going to go down and come back up.
},
{
    808.7,811.12
     Slow down and come back up.
},
{
    811.12,815.36
     You might not be comfortable to go all the way up initially, but what we're trying to
},
{
    815.36,817.96
     do, we're trying to create that movement.
},
{
    817.96,827.24
     Hold it there for five to 10 seconds, slow back down and back up again. If you find that this you're feeling the
},
{
    827.24,834.92
     stretch in some specific position, hold it there for 10, 20 seconds, progress it to 30
},
{
    834.92,842.36
     seconds. It feels very comfortable, not feeling a strong pull and slowly if you find it more
},
{
    842.36,845.0
     comfortable you can actually bring it a little bit hard.
},
{
    845.0,848.0
     You're going to practice the same thing on the other leg.
},
{
    848.0,852.0
     You might find one side is a little bit more tighter than the other side.
},
{
    853.0,859.0
     Bring it up, breathe in and out, slow.
},
{
    860.0,862.0
     It feels very good.
},
{
    863.0,867.96
     I can feel my hamstring definitely feeling the stretch.
},
{
    867.96,872.0
     Even up to here, I don't need to force it and bring it a little bit harder.
},
{
    872.0,876.68
     This towel, it's great because it gives you kind of like a control on your stretch without
},
{
    876.68,878.52
     pulling too much or too little.
},
{
    878.52,889.92
     You're going to hold it there for 10, 15 seconds. Slowly progress it to 20-30 seconds whole. Try it for
},
{
    889.92,896.98
     three sets to four sets in each side. With following this routine you don't
},
{
    896.98,901.56
     necessarily need to follow the exercises back to back. You can do it in your own
},
{
    901.56,909.52
     way but make sure to try this exercise at least once a day. For optimum results, I always tell my patient to try them twice a day if you have
},
{
    909.52,913.52
     time, when you wake up in the morning or before you go to bed.
},
{
    913.52,917.68
     I hope you find this video helpful. If you have any questions, make sure to leave me
},
{
    917.68,923.4
     comments and I'll get back to you quickly. I'm going to repeat this again one more time
},
{
    923.4,925.64
     that I'm going to give 1% a free
},
