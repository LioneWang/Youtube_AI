     He's a cold out and we are going to demonstrate some exercises together to increase your lung

     capacity. So let's start with diaphragmatic breathing. Take a breath in, put your hands on your tummy.
},
{
    27.0,32.0
     And as you take a breath in, feel the stomach expanding outwards.
},
{
    32.0,41.0
     And this time breathe out through your core, slips like as if you were blowing a candle for twice the amount of time.
},
{
    41.0,45.28
     And take a breath in again once more.
},
{
    45.28,58.48
     And breathe out. Great. Let's move up higher. Put your hands over your ribs. Now expand the ribs out. Take a breath in.
},
{
    58.48,62.0
     And breathe out.
},
{
    62.64,65.0

{
    65.0,70.0
     When you take a breath in, this time you are going to bring the arms upwards.
},
{
    70.0,76.0
     And again, remember, you breathe out at a point in the amount of time.
},
{
    76.0,80.0
     Go slow, breathe out, and bring the arms down.
},
{
    80.0,89.4
     Great. And the last one is meant to remove any secretions from your lungs. So you take
},
{
    89.4,97.44
     a breath in, feel the stomach popping out and breathe out as in a hug. So let's see
},
{
    97.44,111.6
     you do that. Keep your mouth open and do a hug again. Great. These are four simple exercises during these times. Thank you.
