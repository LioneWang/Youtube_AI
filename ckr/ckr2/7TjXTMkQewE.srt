     Bob and Brad, the two most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    9.0,12.0
     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist
},
{
    12.0,13.0
     Brad Heideck physical therapist
},
{
    13.0,15.0
     Because we are the most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    15.0,16.0
     In our opinion of course
},
{
    16.0,19.0
     Bob and Brad, now Brad is going to say these words
},
{
    19.0,21.0
     and we're going to see if he says them correctly
},
{
    21.0,23.0
     because I don't know how to say them so
},
{
    23.0,28.84
     Okay, these are diagnosis of back problems and they're actually quite prevalent across
},
{
    28.84,33.44
     society but the thing is is when a doctor says this to you, you're going to say, oh
},
{
    33.44,37.52
     my god I have this, we're going to explain to you what you have, it's not as bad as
},
{
    37.52,38.52
     these words are.
},
{
    38.52,39.52
     Right.
},
{
    39.52,40.52
     The first one is spondylosis.
},
{
    40.52,41.52
     Spondylosis.
},
{
    41.52,42.52
     Spondylosis.
},
{
    42.52,44.92
     The second one is spondylosis.
},
{
    44.92,49.16
     Spondylosis. And the last one is spondylolisis Spondylysis and the last one is spondylolis thesis
},
{
    49.16,52.84
     Spondylolis thesis, they say D
},
{
    52.84,55.44
     Spondylolis thesis, wow
},
{
    55.44,59.04
     Anyways you can google it and they'll actually pronounce it for you
},
{
    59.04,64.72
     They all sound like they're almost the same thing but they're all really quite different to some extent
},
{
    64.72,68.32
     Right, especially the first one to the last one that we talked about.
},
{
    68.32,72.04
     So let's do that. Let's just go through them one at a time in case you have this
},
{
    72.04,75.32
     and you're kind of wondering what do I have my especially the first is
},
{
    75.32,81.4
     spondylosis. Right. It's not a big deal. This is what really almost
},
{
    81.4,85.6
     probably everybody has to some extent as you get older, right? It's just regular
},
{
    85.88,93.04
     Wearing tear where if you look it up. It says wear normal wear and tear on the back and an interesting thing is spondy
},
{
    93.68,99.56
     That I believe it's Greek or Latin. It just means vertebra. Oh, it does right so that's a base
},
{
    99.56,103.8
     They're talking about that's why all three of these have the first and also says like just an abnormality
},
{
    103.8,104.04
     That's why all three of these have the first and all this is like just an abnormality
},
{
    108.68,114.36
     Isn't it? If you break these words down it becomes not so scary So that one is really not a scary one because again like I said almost probably everybody has a little bit of that
},
{
    114.36,120.6
     When you get over 60 years old you probably could even I would say yeah, I'm definitely yeah, I've got all three of these
},
{
    122.08,125.32
     Okay, and so we're gonna talk about some exercises
},
{
    125.32,126.56
     for all of these at the end,
},
{
    126.56,127.64
     but let's go through them first.
},
{
    127.64,129.16
     Oh, before we go too much further back.
},
{
    129.16,130.52
     Good point, Bob.

     We provide videos on how to stay healthy, fit,
},
{
    140.02,141.96
     and pain-free, and we upload every day.
},
{
    141.96,147.62
     Right, and we're gonna do a lot of education in this video that's going to enlighten you with these terms. Now the
},
{
    147.62,154.04
     second one, spinal olalysis. Spinal olalysis. Okay this one's a little more
},
{
    154.04,159.04
     technical and this one I got to get the spinal for you. This can happen in the
},
{
    159.04,164.48
     low back or the neck. Usually it's low back so we're going to look at the low
},
{
    164.48,168.0
     back and it's typically in the lower lumbar vertebra
},
{
    168.32,172.2
     Oftentimes that L5 the lowest one. Okay, because that's where most of the stress is
},
{
    172.56,175.9
     We're not gonna get into that. You'll just have to believe us so that makes sense
},
{
    175.9,181.52
     Now what it is as I'm gonna show you where did my pin go Bob right here, oh good
},
{
    183.4,187.26
     This short on there around that one. Yeah Yeah, well we're gonna do both actually
},
{
    187.66,190.32
     There's a structure in the back called the par
},
{
    190.72,192.4
     par's in particular
},
{
    192.4,197.84
     This is one I had it. I remember from school, but I don't use it very often in the clinic
},
{
    198.0,204.2
     Okay, but I know where it is. It's we're gonna look at it here if I could pull these two vertebrae out so it's easier to see
},
{
    204.96,206.92
     We have this. You up there, Brad. Yep
},
{
    208.16,212.7
     I got to get my glasses on because this is a smaller area, but I have it highlighted
},
{
    213.84,220.34
     Now if you look at here's L5 and L4, let's say we have the in this case is L4 here's a disc in here
},
{
    220.72,228.1
     This I put in there just to represent that's where the spinal cord goes. Okay? And there's room down there. I know someone might get technical and say the
},
{
    228.1,232.3
     spinal cord doesn't go before L1 and we're not going to get into that. This
},
{
    232.3,237.72
     red mark right here on this part of the bone is the parzarticularis. Sure. And
},
{
    237.72,242.48
     that is usually it becomes a stress fracture and it can actually become
},
{
    242.48,246.28
     more of a stretch fracture and break apart. But when it starts to do that, it
},
{
    246.28,249.0
     progresses to spondylolisthesis, which will get into the
},
{
    249.0,253.16
     next. So right there can cause problems. And you look at the
},
{
    253.16,258.0
     nerve right here. If this inflames because of the stress
},
{
    258.0,260.96
     fracture, that nerve can get involved and that can cause more
},
{
    260.96,262.8
     pain and symptoms that you want to avoid.
},
{
    263.68,266.1
     Well, you had some interesting statistics on this, Brad,
},
{
    266.1,266.94
     that I never knew.
},
{
    266.94,271.5
     One, that it actually happens in young adults boys.
},
{
    271.5,272.98
     Right, adolescents, you know,
},
{
    272.98,275.34
     usually in the early teenage years,
},
{
    275.34,277.54
     often associated with active people
},
{
    277.54,279.54
     that are in athletics, contact sports,
},
{
    279.54,280.5
     or repetitive motions.
},
{
    280.5,281.5
     Which makes sense.
},
{
    281.5,283.58
     Things where they extend,
},
{
    283.58,288.46
     because that pushes a lot of pressure on that part of the vertebra to cause that stress fracture
},
{
    288.46,294.42
     So you really think of I think of young girls as far as gymnasts because they're always in that hyper extended position
},
{
    294.42,299.4
     Not only that they're in hyper extended and then they land with a tremendous amount of force to just jam
},
{
    299.4,301.4
     I'm shocked that every one of them doesn't have this
},
{
    301.4,303.4
     I know it's really interesting
},
{
    303.4,305.52
     But it is more common in males.
},
{
    305.52,307.24
     This is interesting, in fact.
},
{
    307.24,311.76
     50% of all back pain in that age group
},
{
    311.76,313.96
     is from this diagnosis.
},
{
    313.96,316.04
     So if you're having back pain at that age,
},
{
    316.04,318.2
     this is one of the things you should consider
},
{
    318.2,320.76
     as a possibility, and that x-rays would pick that up.
},
{
    320.76,322.32
     And there's a special test, and I'll show you,
},
{
    322.32,323.56
     it's a simple one.
},
{
    323.56,328.48
     Okay, and we've done this on another video quite a while ago as you stand on one leg and then you've been back
},
{
    328.96,335.16
     Into one side and if that consistently flares it up because you're stressing that stress fracture
},
{
    335.44,337.28
     You can do it the other way then too Brad
},
{
    337.28,342.8
     Right, yeah, stand on the opposite leg and if I'm on my left leg I'm gonna go back and to the left side
},
{
    342.8,347.32
     So you're looking to see whether or not the pain on the left side on this one is being enhanced. Right
},
{
    347.32,353.44
     exactly. If you do that and you have pain with that, that's not a hundred percent
},
{
    353.44,356.36
     certain that that's what you have, it's just an indicator. It's just one more
},
{
    356.36,361.68
     possibility you know pushing towards that. Right and they estimate 6% of the
},
{
    361.68,365.72
     population have this. Okay. Which isn a lot, but it's a fair amount
},
{
    368.22,374.72
     Oftentimes associated with genetics, you know, and then we talked about the other activities now. Let's go to the other one
},
{
    374.72,376.24
     That's just probably
},
{
    376.24,380.04
     More problematic and that's bondololis desis
},
{
    380.64,383.04
     Desis, and I said THE
},
{
    384.04,387.64
     I have a hard time with it. Your daughter is a speech
},
{
    387.64,393.12
     therapist, maybe she can come and help us out. Alright, so spondylolisthesis is
},
{
    393.12,399.6
     usually an L4 or L5 or L5 and S1 and the big difference with this is I
},
{
    399.6,405.0
     cannot show you on this model but let's look at this one
},
{
    405.0,409.56
     because I have this diagnosis and actually my L4 shifts
},
{
    409.56,414.56
     over my L5 in the anterior or forward direction.
},
{
    414.64,416.16
     So like here Bob is showing.
},
{
    416.16,419.12
     So here's normal and here's putting forward.
},
{
    419.12,420.68
     Now normally there's a disc between there.
},
{
    420.68,421.52
     Right, exactly.
},
{
    421.52,423.32
     But you no longer have a disc between yours.
},
{
    423.32,426.12
     My disc is completely gone and it looks like
},
{
    426.4,430.86
     according to the x-rays that the bone has fused together and that's what I'm hoping for so it's more stable
},
{
    431.68,435.88
     Funny how the body is it I mean a lot of things the body will heal if you let it
},
{
    435.88,438.4
     Yeah, if you give it time and you treat it properly
},
{
    438.4,444.44
     So we're gonna talk about treatment for spinal lysis and spinal lysis desis are very similar
},
{
    444.44,448.5
     Right, you could do the same exercises and probably get similar results
},
{
    448.5,452.36
     Sounds good. Each individual is a little different, but that's how we're going to approach it
},
{
    455.0,458.44
     The first one we have everybody do is knees to chest, won't you say Brad?
},
{
    458.68,466.06
     Now big thing about spinal lysis desis is you want to avoid extension. Actually both of these extension exercises
},
{
    466.06,469.6
     So you're not gonna stretch out like this a lot. I'll do this a little bit
},
{
    469.6,473.58
     But I'm not gonna repeat it very often because it my body's talking to me about it
},
{
    474.16,479.76
     Activities if you're gonna wash the ceiling have somebody else do it. Yeah, I've tried that trying to go up
},
{
    479.76,484.12
     Yeah, it hurts for the next day or so so avoid things like that
},
{
    484.96,486.96
     but one thing that
},
{
    487.08,491.0
     does do well with is flexion and that's
},
{
    491.8,497.6
     Doing double knees to chest you could start off single if you want to right. Yeah, that's a good point Bob
},
{
    497.76,502.64
     You can start out here. I wouldn't do more than ten. I think after ten year you're stretched out enough
},
{
    504.68,507.28
     Sometimes I will hold this
},
{
    507.28,511.92
     because it feels really good and this is usually after I've been standing and
},
{
    511.92,515.92
     I'm you know in that more of an extension mode but I won't hold it for
},
{
    515.92,519.4
     minutes usually you know 20 30 seconds at the most when it gets done feeling
},
{
    519.4,522.64
     good that I'm back to here. The next thing you want to do after you get that
},
{
    522.64,528.1
     range of motion is some strengthening exercises to strengthen the abdominal, the core
},
{
    528.1,531.8
     muscles in the front. The core muscles all the way in the back but this is what
},
{
    531.8,536.0
     you want to really become dominant so they protect those vertebra from
},
{
    536.0,540.8
     shifting again. And I've been doing these for, let's get the ball, can you Bob? I've
},
{
    540.8,545.76
     been doing these for approximately five years now on a fairly consistent basis and
},
{
    546.78,555.32
     Actually, I've been proved quite a bit from four years ago. Yeah to having back pain every day to now just when I do silly things and abuse it
},
{
    556.2,558.2
     But I'm trying to avoid those things
},
{
    558.64,566.62
     Sorry, I got my brown shoes on today. I usually have my back shoes someone commented on that Bob. They were not happy with that. Yeah, I know
},
{
    566.62,568.62
     I'm sorry. I'm sorry
},
{
    568.88,575.26
     There's in a hurry, but this is a great exercise right here forces a low back in a good posture
},
{
    575.34,581.84
     It really works you up Dom on them else as well and you get some hamstring and some hip strengthening as well
},
{
    582.6,585.2
     Okay, and then I'll just go in this position
},
{
    585.2,586.64
     and this just feels good
},
{
    586.64,590.22
     and I'll work the core from this direction.
},
{
    591.36,592.84
     And if you're starting out with these,
},
{
    592.84,594.64
     probably 10 will be good
},
{
    594.64,596.96
     and you're gonna get some sore stomach muscles.
},
{
    596.96,599.96
     You know, if you're fairly fit, you know, you'll build up.
},
{
    599.96,603.04
     I usually do 50 of these and then I stop
},
{
    603.04,605.64
     and I have a little more of a routine than that.
},
{
    605.64,612.28
     Then the third one I do is here and here and I double it up, the double crunch and I'm
},
{
    612.28,620.0
     thinking about lifting my buttocks up in the air because that will help flex that low back,
},
{
    620.0,625.94
     those low vertebrae and get those muscles in the front strong. Okay and then the final
},
{
    625.94,629.9
     one this is one of my favorite because not only does it strengthen your core
},
{
    629.9,634.42
     you get the oblique muscles on this one but right here under your back with me
},
{
    634.42,641.3
     anyways it scratches my back and it really feels good. So I do the criss-cross
},
{
    641.3,649.14
     elbow to knee opposite knee and you do you do those until your muscles get fatigued.
},
{
    649.14,651.6
     And those are a wonderful tool.
},
{
    651.6,654.04
     And I really am an advocate of using the ball
},
{
    654.04,656.76
     because it protects your back from overdoing it.
},
{
    656.76,660.24
     And otherwise your back can arch in the opposite direction.
},
{
    660.24,661.76
     It will not do that with the ball.
},
{
    661.76,663.12
     Get a little bit of squeaky bench here, Brad.
},
{
    663.12,663.96
     I know it.
},
{
    663.96,664.8
     Wow.
},
{
    664.8,666.56
     And remember, Brad, we're not just pretty.
},
{
    666.56,667.76
     We're pretty ugly, Bob.
},
{
    667.76,669.0
     No, we're pretty handy.
},
{
    669.0,669.84
     Oh, that's right.
},
{
    669.84,670.68
     Again, make sure you subscribe.
},
{
    670.68,672.2
     Thanks a lot for watching.
