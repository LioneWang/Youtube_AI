     Hi everyone, thank you for watching this video. Today I'm going to talk about osteoporosis.
},
{
    7.0,12.36
     Osteoporosis is a bone disease that is affecting many people all around the world. What study
},
{
    12.36,17.56
     and research has shown that with adding weight-bearing exercises and changing your diet, you can
},
{
    17.56,22.28
     improve your condition. In this routine, I'm going to show you a series of exercises that
},
{
    22.28,29.16
     pay a low impact but at the same time you can challenge yourself and slowly build up your muscle mass and strengthen your bone.
},
{
    29.16,32.64

},
{
    42.16,44.4
     Let's get started.
},
{
    44.4,46.64
     If you're suffering from osteoporosis,
},
{
    46.64,49.24
     you can start this routine with body weight,
},
{
    49.24,51.08
     and if you've never done any exercises,
},
{
    51.08,53.56
     I suppose adding extra load at the start,
},
{
    53.56,55.24
     it can be a little bit difficult.
},
{
    55.24,57.6
     I would suggest you to start these exercises
},
{
    57.6,59.16
     with minimum equipment,
},
{
    59.16,62.0
     which means you can have used bottle of water,
},
{
    62.0,64.28
     or if you have weights at home or resistant men,
},
{
    64.28,67.72
     that would definitely do the job. I'm gonna show you the exercise one by one and
},
{
    67.72,72.36
     you can give it a try. Now for every person the intensity of workout can be
},
{
    72.36,78.04
     different. Give yourself enough rest between sets and make sure to literally
},
{
    78.04,81.28
     follow the exercise with the right technique that I show you here. We're
},
{
    81.28,88.92
     gonna start this exercises with squat which is a body weight exercise and we're we're going to do basically seated squat, which means you use a seat as
},
{
    88.92,92.32
     an assistant. I'm going to show you from two different angles, you can give it a try. We're
},
{
    92.32,96.6
     going to start basically with bodyweight exercises, which is very gentle, but effective
},
{
    96.6,103.08
     exercise to strengthen your lower body. We're going to do a full range, which means you're
},
{
    103.08,105.56
     going to go all the way down and come back up.
},
{
    105.56,111.52
     I'm going to show you from the other side that you can basically see.
},
{
    111.52,112.52
     Control down.
},
{
    112.52,113.52
     One job.
},
{
    113.52,122.52
     We can start this exercise for three sets of 10 to 12 and gradually progress it to 15.
},
{
    122.52,126.32
     If you find this is easy you can add on weights which means
},
{
    126.32,132.32
     you can use a medicine ball or if you have a bottle of water you can slowly add
},
{
    132.32,139.68
     that on. Slow and control, back up as you can see I'm going very slow and you can
},
{
    139.68,143.88
     slowly progress these exercises. I'm going to upload another video that can be a
},
{
    143.88,147.76
     progression for this routine and you can look forward for that if you find this
},
{
    147.76,152.8
     exercise easy. You are going to do a full routine of exercises for your whole
},
{
    152.8,156.56
     body. Basically we're going to use lower body, upper body and some core
},
{
    156.56,160.8
     exercises for you to actually activate your core as well. The second exercise is
},
{
    160.8,168.82
     going to be shoulder press which means you can use a bottle bar or some can at home and you can try this exercise. We're trying to be seated in a
},
{
    168.82,172.66
     position that you can stabilize your back and don't compensate. Slow control
},
{
    172.66,179.66
     down and back up. All the way down, control up. Slow control down and back up.
},
{
    179.66,184.7
     Now the weight that you have can be as light as 1 to 2 pounds and slowly
},
{
    184.7,185.32
     gradually you
},
{
    185.32,186.32
     build up.
},
{
    186.32,192.84
     You're going to start with 3 sets of 8 to 10 and you can progress them gradually to 12.
},
{
    192.84,198.76
     Now if your range of movements is not all the way up, go to the point that you feel comfortable.
},
{
    198.76,200.8
     Slow control and back down.
},
{
    200.8,209.54
     Now and if you find doing it with two hands at the same time is a little bit difficult for you, you can do them in a single arm and gradually build up to
},
{
    209.54,213.82
     two hands. The following exercise that I'm going to show you guys is going to be
},
{
    213.82,217.78
     step up and from side step up. I'm going to show you how to do it and you can give
},
{
    217.78,221.78
     it a try. This exercise can be a great exercise for you to slowly build up your
},
{
    221.78,231.36
     confidence of going up and down the stairs, which means we're going to go stand pretty close to the stairs or step if you have these at home and
},
{
    231.36,233.76
     slowly come up, control down.
},
{
    233.76,237.64
     You're going to go with a single leg, slow control down.
},
{
    237.64,242.72
     Always you can try these next to the wall that you basically you can maintain your balance.
},
{
    242.72,245.2
     Like if you turn that way you can actually maintain
},
{
    245.2,253.12
     your balance and get some help from the wall. Still control down, back up. This helps you to balance
},
{
    253.12,258.8
     and strengthen each side of your body which means each thighs, glutes and your quads.
},
{
    260.4,268.0
     And if you start this with three sets of let's say eight to ten, you can switch legs and try it in both sides.
},
{
    268.0,271.0
     Usually one side is weaker than the other side.
},
{
    272.0,275.0
     To get some balance from the ball, but not too much.
},
{
    275.0,284.0
     These help you to build your confidence and at the same time strengthen the biggest muscle group that we have, our glutes and quads.
},
{
    284.0,285.0
     You're going to go glutes and quads.
},
{
    285.0,287.58
     You're gonna go slow control and back again.
},
{
    287.58,290.02
     Now, while you're doing this exercise guys,
},
{
    290.02,291.96
     as I mentioned earlier,
},
{
    291.96,294.52
     you want to move on with your own pace.
},
{
    294.52,296.0
     Rest a little bit longer between sets.
},
{
    296.0,299.16
     You can try this for three sets of eight to 10 each side
},
{
    299.16,301.16
     and then slowly build it up.
},
{
    301.16,303.08
     The following exercise that I'm going to show you guys
},
{
    303.08,304.68
     is gonna strengthen your upper body,
},
{
    304.68,309.52
     which is called dips. You can use a chair or something like that. And what we're going to do,
},
{
    309.52,315.6
     we're going to basically keep our hands next to the chair and slowly going down and coming back.
},
{
    315.6,329.08
     Initially, you want to stay as close as possible to the chair, slow control and come back up. Slow control and come back up. Keep the back nice and tall. You're
},
{
    329.08,336.44
     going to start with three sets of eight and progress them to ten to twelve. Slow
},
{
    336.44,343.0
     down and come back up. Now you can try this exercise with kind of like maybe
},
{
    343.0,345.92
     even three sets of five if you find it very difficult
},
{
    345.92,351.76
     and it slowly build up to eight and ten. We're going to move on to calf raises which is a great
},
{
    351.76,356.56
     exercise for you and the calf muscle is a very important muscle group for you to actually improve
},
{
    356.56,362.96
     your circulation. Calf muscle can help your venous return which means blood flow back to your heart
},
{
    362.96,366.76
     and with strengthening your calves you can actually improve that.
},
{
    366.76,368.92
     And your heart can actually work less.
},
{
    368.92,372.92
     Beside that, calf muscles are important for your movement, which means going up to the
},
{
    372.92,375.8
     stairs, coming down the stairs, and help you to actually move easier.
},
{
    375.8,379.08
     I'm going to show you how to do a body weight calf raises.
},
{
    379.08,381.72
     You can use the stairs or a step that you have.
},
{
    381.72,383.32
     Use the wall for balance.
},
{
    383.32,385.68
     And if you're standing on the staircase you can hold
},
{
    385.68,393.44
     the basic your stairs, slow control down, back up. You can try these exercises in three different
},
{
    393.44,400.72
     angles. You can keep your foot straight, the second set you can bring the toes out, keep the
},
{
    400.72,409.64
     knees straight. We're going to start with three sets of eight to ten and slowly progress it to twelve to
},
{
    409.64,410.64
     fifteen.
},
{
    410.64,412.64
     And the last set, you can bring your toes in.
},
{
    412.64,417.28
     I'm going to show you from other way as well.
},
{
    417.28,426.24
     Basically the initial set, you can keep the knees basically straight, toes straight, the second set, toes out,
},
{
    428.32,436.24
     and the last set, you can bring the toes in. You can start with three sets of eight to ten.
},
{
    436.24,440.4
     You will find these exercises if you haven't done it for a while, and pretty challenging,
},
{
    440.4,446.6
     and calves might get a little sore, but as soon as you do these exercises more often your body get adapted to it
},
{
    446.6,450.14
     You might get a little bit sore at the start, but don't worry about it work through it
},
{
    450.14,452.68
     And this is definitely going to help you to get better
},
{
    453.64,456.46
     I'm going to move on to a core exercise routine
},
{
    456.46,462.08
     I'm going to show you two different version that you can try and see which works for you the best and you can basically
},
{
    462.44,470.08
     Practice this we can basically start with a normal plank that you can do at home and like basically
},
{
    470.08,474.28
     elbows gonna be underneath of your shoulder and you can keep the knees
},
{
    474.28,479.76
     kind of straight and you can hold that and start that from five to ten seconds
},
{
    479.76,484.72
     and by the point that you felt that you feel the shake you can basically stop
},
{
    484.72,486.08
     your plank. Now one of the things about plank that you felt that you feel the shake, you can basically stop your plank.
},
{
    486.08,488.48
     Now, one of the things about plank that is important
},
{
    488.48,491.92
     that for you to do is to not sink down
},
{
    491.92,494.72
     and push the hip up, but not too high.
},
{
    494.72,498.52
     Basically, you wanna kinda like keep it kinda like back straight.
},
{
    498.52,503.24
     You can hold it there for 10, 15 to 20 seconds and rest.
},
{
    503.24,508.34
     If you find on the elbows plank doesn't feel comfortable, you can do a high plank which
},
{
    508.34,513.4
     means on your hands it's an easier version.
},
{
    513.4,520.24
     You basically can most probably hold a little bit longer and your feet can be slightly kind
},
{
    520.24,524.44
     of like a shoulder part, a bit apart or a little bit wider than that.
},
{
    524.44,530.24
     That actually can help you to make it a little bit easier. This is another version that you can literally try your
},
{
    530.24,536.56
     plank at home and slowly build it up. It is, it doesn't matter how long you can hold it. It's
},
{
    536.56,542.32
     literally a matter of like strengthening your overall core and it's one of the exercises that you
},
{
    542.32,546.12
     can basically do. If you wanted to do more core exercises,
},
{
    546.12,549.36
     specifically for your back, I have another routine.
},
{
    549.36,550.76
     I'm gonna share with you in this video,
},
{
    550.76,553.32
     you can get access to it and practice
},
{
    553.32,556.1
     and mix those exercises with this routine
},
{
    556.1,557.32
     that I showed you today.
},
{
    557.32,560.04
     We're going to finish this routine guys with glute bridges.
},
{
    560.04,562.64
     It's a great exercise for strengthening your glutes
},
{
    562.64,563.48
     and your hamstrings.
},
{
    563.48,565.56
     I'm gonna show you how to do it and you can do it or try it.
},
{
    565.56,568.6
     You're going to lie down on your back and this exercise,
},
{
    569.2,572.08
     you have an option to add on weight in future if you have on it.
},
{
    572.56,576.12
     Hands next to your body, your feet shoulder apart,
},
{
    576.6,579.04
     and you want to drive the hip up, slow control down.
},
{
    579.76,583.92
     You can use your hands to stabilize your body, slow control down
},
{
    589.36,594.52
     and back up. Relax. You can hold it at the top for a second, squeeze the glutes and basically feeling the glutes and hamstring
},
{
    594.52,599.64
     works. Now if your foot stay a little bit far away from your body, you're engaging more
},
{
    599.64,605.28
     hamstring in comparison to the glutes. Now if you keep the foot closer to your body
},
{
    605.28,612.48
     it would be more kind of like glutes. If you have some weights like at home you
},
{
    612.48,617.16
     can add on weights on top and hold the weights and do this exercise. You can try
},
{
    617.16,621.84
     this for three sets of 12 to 15 repetition and give like let's say five
},
{
    621.84,625.0
     to 10 second rest between each set.
},
