{
    0.0,4.88
     Oh, it hurts so good though.
},
{
    4.88,7.8
     Gotta get those girls where the girls in.
},
{
    7.8,12.88
     Alright guys, hot girl summer or hot crag summer?
},
{
    12.88,17.36
     Probably hot crag summer as long as we can keep his biceps from bothering him.
},
{
    17.36,33.0
     Oh, it hurts actually. That's actually it. What is up, pre-habbers?
},
{
    33.0,34.56
     Welcome back to the channel.
},
{
    34.56,36.52
     Dr. Lauren Linus here with Dr. Craig Lindell.
},
{
    36.52,40.08
     Today, guys, let's talk about biceps pain and biceps tendonitis.
},
{
    40.08,46.08
     So Craig is really worried about hot girl summer or hot Craig summer as we like to call it.
},
{
    46.08,48.56
     So today let's go through some of the best exercise
},
{
    48.56,51.72
     to help with lingering bicep pain that you may be having
},
{
    51.72,54.32
     when doing bicep-based exercises.
},
{
    54.32,55.84
     So I'm gonna have Craig go through
},
{
    55.84,57.44
     a few strengthening exercises first
},
{
    57.44,58.28
     and then we're gonna go through
},
{
    58.28,61.36
     some really good mobility exercises as well.
},
{
    61.36,64.56
     Without further ado, let's jump into that first exercise.
},
{
    64.56,69.76
     So I'm gonna have Craig go ahead, land on his side and grab a lighter dumbbell. Doesn't need to be anything super heavy.
},
{
    69.76,72.8
     Not anything that I'm doing my, my hot Craig summer.
},
{
    73.52,77.68
     Hot Craig summer. Okay, he's going to get into his side plank position here, you guys. So core is
},
{
    77.68,82.16
     tight, hips are up. From here, he's going to work on pulling his shoulder blade back. Then he's
},
{
    82.16,90.28
     going to go into external rotation through that. Yep, through the shoulder. So here, goal of this exercise with biceps
},
{
    90.28,93.6
     tendonitis. A lot of times we don't have a lot of stability and strength through
},
{
    93.6,97.36
     those periscabular muscles or the muscles that support that shoulder blade.
},
{
    97.36,101.2
     External rotation is also going to help to open up the front of the shoulder to
},
{
    101.2,105.28
     alleviate any tension or pinching that we have on that biceps
},
{
    105.28,110.0
     tendon. So Craig is going to go through about 15 to 20 of these in that side plank position.
},
{
    110.0,114.0
     If this feels really uncomfortable, you're having a hard time keeping those hips up.
},
{
    114.0,116.88
     Craig can go into also a modified side plank where he's on his knees
},
{
    118.4,125.74
     and then he's lifting his hips up. Good. And he's going to shoot for about 15 to 20 of these on each side, really focusing on
},
{
    125.74,130.96
     good shoulder stability and controlled external rotation through that arm.
},
{
    130.96,131.96
     How's it feeling, Craig?
},
{
    131.96,132.96
     I'm burning.
},
{
    132.96,133.96
     Yeah.
},
{
    133.96,134.96
     Oh, it's hot in here now.
},
{
    134.96,135.96
     Okay, guys.
},
{
    135.96,139.24
     From here, I'm going to grab Craig the ball.
},
{
    139.24,144.0
     So again, as I mentioned, we really want to work on shoulder stability, very, very important,
},
{
    144.0,148.64
     especially if you're an overhead athlete. Okay, from here Craig's going to put the
},
{
    148.64,154.24
     ball under his hips kind of right between belly button and chest, whatever
},
{
    154.24,159.04
     feels comfortable. The further Craig has the ball towards his hips, the harder
},
{
    159.04,162.8
     it's gonna be, so find whatever feels comfortable for you. From here I'm gonna
},
{
    162.8,169.68
     have Craig really work on his shoulder strength. He's going to do, come up into a Y motion up overhead.
},
{
    169.68,171.94
     Thumbs up, pulling with the shoulder blades
},
{
    171.94,173.6
     and then come down and relax.
},
{
    174.52,176.1
     Good, and he's doing a great job too.
},
{
    176.1,178.2
     When you're doing this, you guys keep your gaze down.
},
{
    178.2,180.22
     We don't wanna strain the neck muscles.
},
{
    180.22,183.04
     Really think about pulling through the shoulder blades,
},
{
    183.04,184.68
     pinching those shoulder blades together.
},
{
    184.68,188.56
     Thumbs stay up. Really important for helping to strengthen those shoulder muscles. How's it
},
{
    188.56,194.32
     feeling Craig? It's good. It's very easy to uh if you feel your biceps with this right, like you're
},
{
    194.32,200.96
     saying, feel those shoulder blades working. Yep. Yeah, so we want to again unload that biceps tendon,
},
{
    200.96,210.22
     that long head of the biceps tendon comes up through a very small groove here. So if you have poor posture, you're sitting like this, we'll pinch in through that biceps tendon.
},
{
    210.22,214.96
     This is going to help to open you up, improve your posture, get those shoulder muscles nice and strong.
},
{
    214.96,222.32
     Okay. From here, let's go ahead, let's stitch the ball Craig. Great job.
},
{
    222.32,225.8
     Hot Craig Summer. Okay, from here you guys,
},
{
    225.8,227.94
     we're gonna head and grab the foam roll.
},
{
    231.36,233.0
     And we're gonna work on again,
},
{
    233.0,236.8
     some of those muscles that help with overhead,
},
{
    236.8,238.6
     strengthening, yeah, perfect.
},
{
    238.6,241.48
     So, the biceps tendon, what does it do?
},
{
    241.48,243.48
     It helps, it assists with overhead flexion.
},
{
    243.48,248.28
     It also helps with bending that elbow and forearm rotation or what we call supination.
},
{
    248.28,252.36
     So we really want to work on, again, opening up the chest, working on that
},
{
    252.36,256.48
     overhead mobility without further irritating or pinching that bicep
},
{
    256.48,259.84
     tendon. So Craig is doing a really good job here, rolling out slow and control.
},
{
    259.84,263.48
     He's putting a little pressure into the foam roll here just to get a little
},
{
    263.48,265.06
     activation of some of those muscles
},
{
    265.06,268.22
     that help assist with that overhead flexion.
},
{
    268.22,269.38
     How is that feeling, Craig?
},
{
    269.38,270.42
     It's good.
},
{
    270.42,271.62
     That looks good.
},
{
    271.62,273.1
     I feel my serratus working.
},
{
    273.1,275.22
     He feels the serratus working.
},
{
    275.22,279.98
     So you guys, we have some really good info on serratus,
},
{
    279.98,281.66
     or that's serratus interior muscle.
},
{
    281.66,283.3
     Check it out.
},
{
    283.3,285.04
     But this is a really, really good exercise,
},
{
    285.04,287.04
     especially if you're an overhead athlete.
},
{
    287.04,289.86
     Research actually shows that biseptendinitis
},
{
    289.86,292.64
     is common in youth overhead athletes,
},
{
    292.64,295.44
     and it's actually a really primary condition that we see.
},
{
    295.44,297.4
     So working on that overhead control,
},
{
    297.4,299.96
     getting that serratus interior to help us stabilize
},
{
    299.96,302.16
     and control that overhead motion is key
},
{
    302.16,309.6
     in regards to controlling biseptendinitis. Awesome, okay Okay, from here let's go into a few mobility exercises. Again, we want to
},
{
    309.6,314.6
     open up the chest, unload that biceps tendon. So let's go ahead and start in an
},
{
    314.6,319.08
     all four position. We really want to make sure that we're getting that mid-back
},
{
    319.08,323.28
     moving. Also, we want to get that shoulder blade moving appropriately on that
},
{
    323.28,328.2
     rib cage. So I'm gonna have Craig bring one hand up to his ear, bend his elbow.
},
{
    328.24,332.8
     From here, he's going to tuck his elbow down and under, really thinking of rotating
},
{
    332.8,334.56
     through that mid-back, that shoulder blade.
},
{
    334.76,338.68
     And then he's going to rotate all the way up, letting his eyes follow his hand.
},
{
    339.48,340.88
     Good. And then coming down.
},
{
    341.48,345.48
     Key exercise again to work on mid-back mobility, shoulder mobility.
},
{
    345.48,348.52
     We want to unload the front of that shoulder and Craig's gonna shoot for
},
{
    348.52,353.32
     about 10 to 15 on each side. If you're doing this at home, let us know what you're
},
{
    353.32,356.64
     feeling. If you get a snack crack while we're popper too, you may. That means your
},
{
    356.64,360.68
     body probably needed to move in this direction. How's it feeling Craig? It's
},
{
    360.68,365.0
     good. I decided only two reps on that side.
},
{
    365.0,368.0
     I'll do a few more on this side.
},
{
    368.0,375.0
     Okay. Once Craig is done here, we're going to do one more mobility exercise to help to open up his chest a little bit.
},
{
    375.0,379.0
     While he's finishing up, let me grab the foam roll that we need.
},
{
    381.0,383.0
     Nice, Craig. Okay.
},
{
    383.0,386.0
     Last exercise for hot Craig summer.
},
{
    386.0,387.0
     Okay.
},
{
    387.0,391.0
     At home, Craig is going to lay on the foam roll here.
},
{
    391.0,392.0
     Carefully.
},
{
    392.0,393.0
     Good.
},
{
    393.0,394.0
     Okay.
},
{
    394.0,396.0
     Nice and relaxed.
},
{
    396.0,397.0
     Head is supported.
},
{
    397.0,400.0
     Make sure your head is supported, guys, when you're doing this one.
},
{
    400.0,402.0
     He can start with his arms out to the side.
},
{
    402.0,403.0
     Okay.
},
{
    403.0,405.24
     You should feel a big stretch in through the front of your chest.
},
{
    405.24,406.6
     We want to open up the chest.
},
{
    406.6,411.52
     Again, biceps tendonitis is common when we kind of have that rounded, forward head posture.
},
{
    411.52,414.86
     So if we can lengthen those muscles, open up the chest, it can help to unload the biceps
},
{
    414.86,415.86
     tendon.
},
{
    415.86,420.68
     Craig can also do some snow angels here so he can bring his arms up overhead like he's
},
{
    420.68,421.68
     making a snow angel.
},
{
    421.68,422.68
     Good.
},
{
    422.68,428.44
     And then come back down thinking about trying to keep the back of his hands on the floor.
},
{
    428.44,434.6
     And then he can also bend his elbows, bring his hands up to his ears and do some chicken
},
{
    434.6,435.6
     wings here too.
},
{
    435.6,437.8
     Again, just to open up the shoulder blades.
},
{
    437.8,441.04
     He's thinking about kind of pinching the shoulder blades around that foam roll as he
},
{
    441.04,442.04
     goes.
},
{
    442.04,445.28
     All of these exercises really, really good to help to open up the chest.
},
{
    445.92,449.28
     What do you think Craig? It's good. My chest needed this. I'm ready.
},
{
    451.76,455.52
     Okay, so at home you guys, you can do about five minutes or so on the foam roll.
},
{
    455.52,459.52
     Really good, especially if you know you've been sitting all day. Your body probably needs this
},
{
    459.52,465.2
     more than you think. Okay, Craig's ready for hot girl summer. I could tan in this position.
},
{
    465.2,469.68
     We'll get the you'll need that for hot Craig summer. Okay, we're gonna go get some tanning
},
{
    469.68,474.16
