     Hey everybody it's Doctor Jo and today I'm going to show you some stretches for the pecs.
},
{
    3.88,5.28
     So let's get started.
},
{
    5.28,7.84
     Disclaimer alert, disclaimer alert!
},
{
    10.52,16.16
     For the stretches we're going to do 30 seconds three times just to get a really good stretch
},
{
    16.16,17.16
     in there.
},
{
    17.16,21.92
     And before we start, if you haven't already subscribed, make sure you click down there.
},
{
    21.92,29.6
     So I've got my little timer to keep us on track. We're going to do a 30-second stretch, take a 10-second break, and then do that three
},
{
    29.6,35.64
     times total. So let's go ahead and do the pec stretch and get started now. So with
},
{
    35.64,39.56
     the pec stretch, you're going to take your hands, clasp them behind your back,
},
{
    39.56,46.92
     and you're going to push down and out, and then push your chest forward. So just holding that stretch right there.
},
{
    46.92,50.36
     And with stretches, they shouldn't be painful.
},
{
    50.36,52.92
     So if you're feeling some pain in the chest area,
},
{
    52.92,55.24
     take a little bit of pressure off of it
},
{
    55.24,57.32
     and don't push down quite as hard.
},
{
    57.32,60.04
     You should feel that right through the front here
},
{
    60.04,63.28
     in that pec area and just holding that stretch
},
{
    63.28,65.32
     for 30 seconds and then take a
},
{
    65.32,69.78
     little 10 second break. So right up in here is where you should feel it. If you
},
{
    69.78,74.76
     have some issues where the nerve is getting pressed on, you might feel a
},
{
    74.76,79.04
     little bit of tingling while you're doing this stretch. So again pushing down
},
{
    79.04,83.68
     and out and pushing your chest forward. Try and keep your head and neck relaxed
},
{
    83.68,85.12
     kind of in a neutral position so you're not pushing out like that. Try and keep your head and neck relaxed kind of in a neutral position.
},
{
    85.12,90.96
     So you're not pushing out like that. I tend to do that. Try and relax your neck and head area.
},
{
    91.68,95.52
     But if you feel some of that tingling, that's probably just because you're
},
{
    95.52,99.36
     stretching that muscle and putting a little bit of pressure on the nerve. So hopefully
},
{
    99.92,105.36
     each time you do that it will get better. But if it doesn't then you probably want to hold off on
},
{
    105.36,110.16
     the stretch and get everything checked out. So we've got one more if you want to shake it out a
},
{
    110.16,117.36
     little bit you can and then just bring their hands back again pushing down and out and pushing that
},
{
    117.36,123.6
     chest forward and you should really feel it right where your arms connect to the body maybe in that
},
{
    123.6,126.36
     armpit area just a little bit, but again
},
{
    126.92,134.04
     Stretching shouldn't hurt. It should be that kind of good hurt, hurt so good kind of feeling. So just a nice stretch there
},
{
    134.76,137.84
     Getting those muscles nice and loose in that chest area
},
{
    145.64,148.28
     Three, two, one. So those were your pec stretches for the chest area.
},
{
    148.28,151.12
     This is actually a part of an office stretching series.
},
{
    151.12,155.08
     So just to get you moving, if you don't get to move a lot and when you're working in the
},
{
    155.08,158.76
     office or if you're at home and you're kind of sitting around doing something for a long
},
{
    158.76,161.68
     time, these are easy stretches that you don't have to have any equipment.
