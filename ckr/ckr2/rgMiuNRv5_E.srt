     Hello and welcome back to the Austin Physio YouTube channel. Today we're going to be looking
},
{
    9.64,16.88
     at what you need to do when your neck spasms. A neck and spasm due to lots of different causes,
},
{
    16.88,20.56
     so typically what's happening is either a facet joint, it's one of the joints in the
},
{
    20.56,25.92
     neck because I've locked into a position or the muscles get incredibly tight and hold
},
{
    25.92,31.52
     the neck in a certain position. We see this in clinic when people have slept slightly awkwardly
},
{
    31.52,36.56
     or they've done repetitive movements and then the neck is just locked into a position or they've been
},
{
    36.56,42.0
     sitting or holding the neck in an abnormal position. All of that can accumulate together to cause
},
{
    42.0,46.16
     stiffness, tightness and guarding around the neck. So
},
{
    46.16,50.68
     what's best to do when this happens? So we always think, you know, go and get it assessed
},
{
    50.68,56.64
     and have treatment. Before you go into clinic, you can start to relax around the neck. Number
},
{
    56.64,62.12
     one, adding heat to the neck. What this does, it gets fresh blood to the area and helps
},
{
    62.12,65.32
     to soften and relax through the muscles. We would
},
{
    65.32,69.48
     recommend holding either a hot water bottle or one of those weak bags that
},
{
    69.48,73.8
     you can put in the microwave around the neck for about two to five minutes.
},
{
    73.8,78.24
     Number two, we want to look at improving quality of movement so we're not
},
{
    78.24,83.28
     looking for quantity, we're looking for quality of movement in the neck. You want
},
{
    83.28,85.24
     to gently tease the neck
},
{
    85.24,87.68
     through its natural range of motion.
},
{
    87.68,89.12
     So what we can do with this
},
{
    89.12,92.0
     is moving it in specific movements for the neck.
},
{
    92.0,94.86
     So gently looking up and down.
},
{
    94.86,98.4
     So again, if you're moving and you're getting to about here
},
{
    98.4,100.04
     and you're thinking, oh, I can't go anymore,
},
{
    100.04,101.2
     just reduce the range.
},
{
    101.2,103.32
     So just take it down a little bit lower.
},
{
    103.32,109.92
     So you're just going into flexion and extension, really gentle quality over quantity, maybe between five to ten reps
},
{
    109.92,113.92
     and then turning side to side. So again, you'll probably find when it's locked up, it's easier
},
{
    113.92,119.88
     in one direction. So once you've added the heat, then trying to induce this movement,
},
{
    119.88,126.32
     slow controlled and within a pain free range.. Number three we can start adding a
},
{
    126.32,131.64
     little bit of stretching again, quality over quantity. Typically we find it's
},
{
    131.64,134.88
     normally in the scalenes or the traps so we want to go through the main
},
{
    134.88,139.46
     stretches around the neck. Number one we can hit the upper fibres of the
},
{
    139.46,145.96
     trapezius so we can do this by clasping around the base of the head as we breathe in,
},
{
    145.96,148.94
     holding it in that position and as we breathe out,
},
{
    148.94,151.16
     gently stretching the neck down.
},
{
    151.16,155.48
     And again, we're expecting this to be quite limited when you first start to do it,
},
{
    155.48,158.14
     but just inducing that movement.
},
{
    158.14,161.36
     Next, we can add in a rotation in the side bending stretch.
},
{
    161.36,165.0
     So if it's too acute, we might want to avoid this stretch initially
},
{
    165.0,169.86
     or at least reduce it. So we can start off over just gently turning the neck. So as far
},
{
    169.86,174.08
     as you feel comfortable and then bringing opposite ear to opposite shoulder so you should
},
{
    174.08,179.6
     feel it stretching down through here. Able to hold between 5 to 15 seconds. If you feel
},
{
    179.6,189.22
     like you can, which is probably unlikely when it's really really guarded is you can obviously increase the stretch a little bit more holding between 5 to 15
},
{
    189.22,194.88
     seconds obviously longer if you can and then gently relaxing back. Number four
},
{
    194.88,198.28
     what I tend to recommend to people is trying to get fresh blood to the area
},
{
    198.28,202.32
     a little bit more with massage so what you can do using the hands is start at
},
{
    202.32,205.12
     the base of the head using a circular motion to
},
{
    205.12,211.44
     follow those muscles down. So starting around the base, following it down, trying to soften any
},
{
    211.44,216.32
     tightness where it's quite guarded and then also working a little bit more around the front.
},
{
    217.2,221.76
     So a little bit more around the front of those neck muscle attachments into the scalings,
},
{
    221.76,226.66
     SCM around the front here, and just relaxing through. Plus
},
{
    226.66,231.2
     continuing around the back of the shoulder as well, so the traps, fibers, the
},
{
    231.2,234.42
     upper fibers of the trapezius attaching up into the neck, you know, if you're
},
{
    234.42,237.86
     comfortable reaching around, just massaging around the back of the shoulder
},
{
    237.86,242.2
     and the same on this side, really nice circular motion, just trying to get blood
},
{
    242.2,245.76
     flow to the area, breaking down that tightness
},
{
    250.56,254.8
     and then relaxing. Number five, we want to start to get movement away from the neck, so in particular the shoulders. Do you think of the neck dropping forward or it's really guarded?
},
{
    254.8,259.84
     We typically adjust and change the position of our shoulders so we can start to kind of
},
{
    259.84,265.2
     circum-duck back and again, you know, reduce the range according to how you feel.
},
{
    270.58,275.66
     But just gently circling back around five to ten circles, just moving through. And then finally number six, we want to look at how often we're doing it and what to avoid.
},
{
    275.92,281.42
     So if the neck is feeling stiff and it's guarded, we want to avoid any prolonged position.
},
{
    281.42,287.0
     So either driving, looking down at our phones, on our computers, anything that's fixing it
},
{
    287.0,289.32
     in a position you wanna keep it moving,
},
{
    289.32,291.44
     plus the routine that we've shown you in this video,
},
{
    291.44,294.24
     doing it at regular points during the day,
},
{
    294.24,296.48
     breaking up the tightness, improving movement,
},
{
    296.48,298.82
     and reducing the tenderness.
},
