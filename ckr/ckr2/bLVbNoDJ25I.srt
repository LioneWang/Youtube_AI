     Bob and Brad the two most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    9.1,14.42
     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist, Brad Heineck physical therapist, we are the most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    14.42,16.42
     In our opinion of course Bob, Brad
},
{
    16.5,21.38
     Today we wanted to talk about the absolute best cold pack that you can make yourself do it yourself
},
{
    22.18,25.52
     We think it's better than gel packs right? Oh yeah and there's a good
},
{
    25.52,30.8
     reason for it. Number one they're easier to make, they're cheaper and they work better. Right I mean
},
{
    30.8,36.32
     they always can't. The big three things. Yeah that's right. Anytime you can talk about less expense
},
{
    36.32,41.28
     with us we're happy. We're going to smile our face. Especially when it works better. By the way Brad,
},
{

     this week. And not only like us because of that because we got good
},
{
    70.38,74.64
     information and the pain-free thing you mentioned that's what we're talking about
},
{
    74.64,80.52
     here with the cold pack. Good segue. I like that. I studied my English class.
},
{
    80.52,89.02
     Okay so we should get into it. Yeah let's let's. Cold pack you know you need a cold pack you sprained your ankle twisted your knee got a pulled muscle back ache
},
{
    89.34,93.32
     Cold packs often always are using that first 48 hours. So
},
{
    94.08,97.0
     And what do you do? You're gonna have if you don't have one at home
},
{
    97.0,102.32
     What are you gonna do? Right down to the store and spend 15-20 dollars on one or make one and it's possible
},
{
    102.32,105.54
     You might have these ingredients at home very possible as a matter of fact
},
{
    105.96,109.32
     We're gonna start out with the two simplest ways to do it is
},
{
    110.0,112.0
     All these tap water
},
{
    112.48,118.14
     Heavy-duty freezer bag with the ziploc. It's gotta be a heavy-duty one. Yep, it should be if you just use a
},
{
    119.48,121.88
     Ziploc bag more chance of it
},
{
    121.88,127.02
     It's gonna crack or bust loose after time. I mean you can if you want to
},
{
    127.92,130.86
     Okay, so one way is what you're saying is just water
},
{
    131.04,132.28
     No
},
{
    132.28,135.78
     If you just use water it's gonna turn into an ice block Bob, sure
},
{
    135.78,139.2
     You try to put an ice block on your shoulder it'd be like taking this
},
{
    139.52,145.52
     This freezer pack from the abided downtown for your cooler you know, picnics and you put it on there
},
{
    145.52,149.32
     Doesn't really conform does it? I've had patients use these at home and I say oh no
},
{
    149.32,152.44
     You can use that but what we have is much better and they're cheaper
},
{
    152.44,154.6
     We want something that's gonna envelope your body
},
{
    154.6,158.6
     Exactly no matter where it is, so get yourself a gallon freezer bag
},
{
    158.76,164.84
     You can use a quart one if you want a small one that's fine a cup to measure water right out of the tap
},
{
    164.84,167.84
     Gotcha, and then you either use salt just regular old
},
{
    168.52,173.6
     Baking salt that comes in for your salt in your food or you can use rubbing alcohol
},
{
    173.6,177.56
     Okay, I didn't know you could use salt. This is new to me. Wow
},
{
    178.92,180.76
     All right
},
{
    180.76,187.74
     Well if we're getting to that Lonnie, Lonnie brought up a good point. What is the ratio? Okay with rubbing alcohol?
},
{
    187.74,191.94
     I didn't want to make it in front of everyone here because I didn't think it was necessary to make a mess
},
{
    192.26,198.2
     But have someone hold the bag open you can do it by yourself and put one cup of water one
},
{
    198.84,199.98
     two
},
{
    199.98,206.86
     Three four cups of water four cups of water one cup of rubbing alcohol put it in there
},
{
    208.72,215.88
     So four to one right get the arrow you got to kind of go like this and get the arrow and zip it shut and
},
{
    216.6,221.58
     Then mix it up a little bit so it all dilutes and then you take another
},
{
    222.02,225.72
     Bag and put it in another bag so you double bag it
},
{
    226.22,227.32
     Okay
},
{
    227.32,234.28
     Then you put it in the freezer nice and flat and leave it overnight or for a few hours and then you'll have a slush
},
{
    235.96,239.16
     Freeze our moldable cold pack and these
},
{
    239.16,243.0
     I've seen these and I mean they work really well. They feel colder than the gel packs
},
{
    243.0,245.54
     I don't know if they are but they feel colder
},
{
    245.54,248.28
     I've used these my mother used them my patients use them
},
{
    248.28,254.64
     I've been giving this recipe out for about 15 years now and everyone likes it. It's an old family Heineck recipe
},
{
    254.64,260.92
     Yeah, Heineck family recipe and here it is. This is the one I made last night. Now this one I use salt, table salt
},
{
    260.92,262.92
     Yes, the ratio is
},
{
    263.44,267.22
     12 parts of water to one part of salt
},
{
    267.22,273.32
     So if you're gonna use I use a half a cup of salt and then six cups so it was a ratio of 12 to 1
},
{
    273.32,278.92
     I did the same thing, let me repeat that, say no more, half a cup of salt, 12 cups of water
},
{
    278.92,283.88
     No, 12 to 1, I used a half a cup of salt so six cups of water
},
{
    283.88,287.44
     Oh see I already wasn't paying attention. So yeah if I use this
},
{
    288.14,290.14
     Sure, I got you
},
{
    290.2,298.28
     So six cups of water versus one half cup of salt and you'll get a bag that looks just like this
},
{
    298.36,300.36
     Let me feel that
},
{
    301.44,304.48
     Now it depends on the makeup of your water
},
{
    309.34,309.5
     Now it depends on the makeup of your water, you know if you're having to water you got a lot of iron in it or whatever
},
{
    315.78,319.64
     Makeup is your water you may have to add a little more water or a little less salt. I like the blue color on there This is just like on Breaking Bad the blue mask. That was the good stuff, you know
},
{
    320.28,326.36
     Oh really? Okay, so here we go now what I did I even put the date that I made it and I put what's in there
},
{
    326.36,330.8
     So I know and I bring it out of the freezer in case someone brings it out and they say oh, what's this?
},
{
    330.8,336.12
     Now am I right in saying Brad that if you use the alcohol it's a little more jelly or not?
},
{
    336.12,342.34
     No, it's about the same depends on the ratio. Okay, I've made these already came out and it's too hard
},
{
    342.34,343.36
     Oh really?
},
{
    343.36,349.04
     Yeah, so then I melt it put a little more salt or a little more rubbing alcohol in it and then you'll get your right consistency
},
{
    349.92,353.96
     But the ratios I've given almost always work. It's nice about the salt and water
},
{
    353.96,358.2
     I mean almost everybody's got that at home. So it's just a matter of they have the bags. Exactly
},
{
    358.6,363.68
     Exactly. So that's a cool. Double bag it. You know I did triple bag one of mine
},
{
    363.68,367.26
     It depends on you know the nice thing about salt water versus gel packs
},
{
    367.82,371.2
     Everyone's gonna break gel packs for you buy or you make sure
},
{
    371.2,373.88
     It's gonna break, they're gonna break, they're gonna be a mess
},
{
    373.88,378.54
     Right matter of fact, I just used when I was in my car driving with a gel pack behind my back
},
{
    378.88,380.88
     Felt great
},
{
    380.88,385.06
     And it got off it and it broke and there was gel stuff all over my back
},
{
    385.06,387.06
     It washed off pretty good though
},
{
    387.54,391.7
     So I was lucky about, but if these break you got nothing but water, for sure, little salt
},
{
    391.7,393.7
     It's gonna evaporate there's gonna be no issue
},
{
    394.54,395.76
     Now
},
{
    395.76,403.1
     This is the bonus part if you don't want to do that you want to make a cold pack that's gonna, for elbow, knee, any part of your body
},
{
    403.34,405.68
     real fast
},
{
    411.16,411.32
     Take a cup either styrofoam or paper go ahead Bob you got one and there you go freeze it
},
{
    414.78,415.36
     That's water, but it's hard. Yeah ice okay
},
{
    419.56,420.08
     Peel off go ahead Bob peel it off. Yeah, you can't do it. You got to expose
},
{
    422.08,422.96
     the ice
},
{
    426.44,427.94
     Okay, and then you can have some sharp edges, rub it a little bit.
},
{
    433.22,433.66
     Now a cold pack will take 15 to 20 minutes as much as recommended to cool the body part down.
},
{
    435.5,437.5
     This five minutes. Oh, that's a nap.
},
{
    438.18,441.74
     You can go five minutes, but in two minutes it'll be cool.
},
{
    441.74,445.24
     I always say five minutes. It takes a minute to acclimate
},
{
    445.24,451.88
     and after a couple minutes Bob is right, it's starting to go numb. Yeah these are really good for smaller surfaces
},
{
    451.88,453.88
     We got tendonitis, elbow
},
{
    455.6,460.46
     Golfers elbow, tennis elbow, really good for shoulders, it works out really good for that
},
{
    460.46,464.32
     I would say even like if you're having a tendonitis of the knee
},
{
    467.44,475.48
     Works out really good for that because again it's just gonna, now with this, with the cold pack you should put a piece of cloth like this towel, a thin towel
},
{
    476.4,480.04
     over the body part and then the cold pack
},
{
    480.56,486.36
     Because you don't want to frost bite your skin, right, if you're going over clothing you'll be doing that, right exactly any kind of cloth
},
{
    486.8,488.4
     Anything
},
{
    488.4,494.4
     But with this you don't have to do that because there's a layer of water so you'll never frost bite your skin
},
{
    494.4,497.4
     You probably want to tallaur underneath you because it does start to get messy
},
{
    497.76,502.36
     That's what's going on here and after about a minute to two minutes it starts to
},
{
    502.76,505.32
     Kind of snap crackle and pop on your skin it hurts
},
{
    505.32,508.6
     Yeah, but once he gets past that it goes numb and then it's good
},
{
    508.6,512.96
     And you can use your tail by just taking two fingers like this and it feels like one that means that
},
{
    512.96,516.62
     Yeah, that is it's adequately gotten cool
},
{
    517.12,520.84
     Exactly, so the other option is buy a little more bonus here
},
{
    520.84,532.48
     If you don't want to go through all that and these work they're not as cold but they still work good this is a sock and I poured rice in it uncooked rice rice and rice rice like what
},
{
    532.48,538.96
     you eat all right rice is a poison yeah don't use that use it now put this around your neck Bob
},
{
    538.96,546.0
     ooh that actually feels good yeah and it's soft and it's cushy you can go on a recliner. It's limited as far as you can kind of
},
{
    546.0,548.64
     Yeah, it's not really really cold, but it's cold
},
{
    549.36,551.96
     And the bonus of this is you can also heat it up
},
{
    552.26,561.0
     In the microwave and we've used this actually my wife had an ear infection and she put it on her ear and it felt a warm one
},
{
    561.0,566.74
     So rice with a sock is a great home remedy that is very inexpensive
},
{
    567.1,572.68
     When did you cool this down? It was in the freezer all night long. Oh, okay. Yeah, because it's still pretty cold
},
{
    572.68,577.2
     Yeah, I pulled it out. It's been in here for an hour so it's cooled down a little bit, but they're kind of fun
},
{
    577.2,580.02
     You know you can throw it over you can play catch with your kids with it
},
{
    580.02,584.98
     You know when you're done you can make rice and eat it, but I wouldn't do that. You can beat your partner with it
},
{
    584.98,586.26
     Be careful Bob.
},
{
    588.0,590.0
     Also you forgot to mention the
},
{
    590.08,595.48
     Red Solo cup. Yeah, if you use a plastic cup like this red Solo cup to freeze ice
},
{
    595.48,599.92
     They're really good for drinking out of but they're not good for this because you can't tear
},
{
    600.0,605.16
     You can't tear it loose so don't don't even go this round. I just got that for the big no-no
},
{
    605.16,609.38
     The no-no, you know I can use a plastic cup as an available
},
{
    609.38,613.3
     Yeah, you could try to cut it off and but then you got a sharp edge with it
},
{
    613.3,617.76
     It's just no good. All sorts of hazards. You keep these for drinking fluids
},
{
    618.0,620.0
     Okay
},
{
    620.0,622.0
     Brad I think we covered everything
},
{
    622.0,626.16
     This is a wonderful thing because we always talk about using cold packs
},
{
    626.16,632.12
     Right, but we've got another video. We'll do another video on when you should use a cold pack versus a hot pack
},
{
    632.12,635.36
     Right, we should do that soon. Next?
},
{
    636.12,638.12
     Well, if you don't know.
},
{
    638.4,None
     Thanks everybody for watching Thank you.
