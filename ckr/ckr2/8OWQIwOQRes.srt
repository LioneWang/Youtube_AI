     One in four of us are snoring culprits giving our bodies and our partners a hard time.
},
{
    10.0,14.0
     Hands up, who snores? I've been told I do.
},
{
    14.0,16.0
     It's like a chainsaw.
},
{
    16.0,18.0
     Does anyone snore here?
},
{
    18.0,19.0
     I snore.
},
{
    19.0,21.0
     What does it sound like?
},
{
    23.0,28.88
     When you go to sleep, the muscles in your throat and neck relax and go floppy.
},
{
    28.88,34.44
     This makes the airways narrow, so air has to be forced out through them, which makes
},
{
    34.44,38.0
     the soft tissues rattle and vibrate.
},
{
    38.0,41.52
     But how can we stop it?
},
{
    41.52,46.08
     Here are some top tips and some brand new and exciting research to try.
},
{
    46.88,54.56
     Top tip number one. Avoid alcohol before bedtime. Boots relaxes the muscles of the soft palate
},
{
    54.56,65.0
     and the throat causing the airways to narrow even more. Top tip number two. there's a reason why we're told to lie on our sides.
},
{
    66.8,69.68
     Well, we lie on our back, our tongue, chin,
},
{
    69.68,74.0
     and the skin and fat around here can relax and squish our airways.
},
{
    75.36,78.48
     And finally, top tip number three.
},
{
    78.48,80.92
     If your snoring comes mainly from your nose,
},
{
    80.92,83.28
     you could try this nasal strip.
},
{
    83.28,85.92
     Basically, they work by pulling your nostrils apart.
},
{
    85.92,92.28
     And if your snoring comes mainly from your mouth you could try this mouth piece.
},
{
    92.28,102.96
     But the best way to keep those airways open and stop the snoring? Strengthen your muscles.
},
{
    102.96,106.12
     A brand new study has shown that doing a simple set
},
{
    106.12,113.52
     of exercises every day can drastically reduce snoring. They have allowed us to reveal their
},
{
    113.52,114.52
     secret.
},
{
    114.52,123.36
     So, get your tongue, push it to the roof of your mouth on your hard palate and then push
},
{
    123.36,124.36
     your tongue backwards.
},
{
    124.36,126.6
     It kind of makes you want to gag a bit.
},
{
    126.6,128.6
     Does it, yeah? Can you feel it?
},
{
    128.6,130.6
     Up. Backward.
},
{
    130.6,132.6
     LAUGHTER
},
{
    132.6,137.0
     Another one is push your tongue down on your soft palate
},
{
    137.0,140.4
     and the tip of your tongue forward.
},
{
    140.4,142.4
     Oh, it's like that.
},
{
    142.4,145.68
     So it's like it's almost stretching your tongue. Show me.
},
{
    146.8,149.6
     Uh-huh, like that. Can you feel it kind of stretching? Yeah?
},
{
    149.6,157.68
     Fantastic, she's doing it! Open your mouth wide and you know the dangly bit, the uvula,
},
{
    157.68,160.64
     push it upwards and go, ah. Ah.
},
{
    162.0,165.0
     Awww!
},
{
    172.0,176.0
     For the best results, you need to do these exercises for two minutes each, three times a day. And in the study, snorkels saw improvements after three months.
