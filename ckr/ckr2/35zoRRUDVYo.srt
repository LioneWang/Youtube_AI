     Hi everyone, Bob is here from Dublin Sports Syndrome Clinic. Today I'm going to
},
{
    4.44,8.48
     show you a couple of exercises in terms of how can you manage your knee injury.
},
{
    8.48,12.92
     If you had a fall, if you had a twisted knee or if you banged your knee to the wall
},
{
    12.92,17.4
     and it's swollen now and it doesn't move that well and it's kind of like a little
},
{
    17.4,21.04
     bit kind of uncomfortable when you walk around. Now you can start this rehab
},
{
    21.04,25.34
     protocol from the day after or even the same day. Let's go through the
},
{
    25.34,33.14
     mobile one. The first thing that you can guys do straight away, even after the injury, you
},
{
    33.14,37.54
     can start do some self massage. Now I have some sort of cream here, you can use olive
},
{
    37.54,44.1
     oil, any type of oil that you have at home, just basically around the area and if you
},
{
    44.1,46.4
     find out there is certain area that is sore
},
{
    46.4,53.04
     don't actually bother those area let them to be alone and you try to work around your knee
},
{
    53.04,58.56
     and like create some sort of like circulation and as you can see I'm not really focusing in one place
},
{
    58.56,67.84
     now this kind of like massage what it does it helps you to actually reduce the sensitivity of your your knee and initially and as you can see I go up to
},
{
    67.84,73.16
     my thigh muscles the back of the my muscles and this is the hamstring muscles
},
{
    73.16,78.72
     my calf muscles the sheen muscles and I'm not really staying in one place I
},
{
    78.72,86.36
     work around that for 10 15 minutes while I'm sitting and if I can actually do some sort of like
},
{
    86.36,91.8
     gentle movement as I'm doing the massage I'll try those and I'll try to
},
{
    91.8,96.26
     massage it in a different stages. Give it a try guys and you
},
{
    96.26,102.2
     find this really helpful. The second exercise guys that you can do right away
},
{
    102.2,109.06
     it's active range of movements of your knee literally you're trying to basically bend your knees and bring it up
},
{
    109.06,114.34
     and bring it down now if you find that this exercise can be a little sore you
},
{
    114.34,119.78
     don't need to go for a full range you can go as far as you can and come back to
},
{
    119.78,127.36
     the initial state which means you're trying to do as far as you can which is pretty
},
{
    127.36,132.24
     normal in the first few days because you just had an injury and in some cases
},
{
    132.24,137.0
     due to the swelling of your knee actually that can be pretty kind of like
},
{
    137.0,140.8
     difficult for you to move it you know but we try to just create some sort of
},
{
    140.8,149.24
     movement as far as you can you don't want to bother your knee and get that movement as fast as possible. Now as you can see I'm going to
},
{
    149.24,154.24
     show you in two different ways. I'm not going for a very quick movement. I'm trying to just
},
{
    154.24,160.96
     bring your knees up, slow control down, up and down. And again if I can feel it
},
{
    160.96,166.72
     okay here it gets sore. I don't go above that. I stay there, work around it,
},
{
    166.72,169.36
     and I just create some sort of movement.
},
{
    169.36,170.96
     You can try this exercise for, let's say,
},
{
    170.96,172.92
     three sets of eight to 10.
},
{
    172.92,174.44
     If you find that it's easy,
},
{
    174.44,177.72
     more focus on your range and slowly progress that.
},
{
    177.72,179.2
     Awesome.
},
{
    179.2,181.64
     The following exercise, guys, I'm going to show you
},
{
    181.64,184.16
     how can you strengthen your hamstring
},
{
    184.16,188.1
     with a very simple equipment. You need a kitchen towel or any type of towel that you have
},
{
    188.1,194.26
     small and I'm going to show you how to use this and strengthen your hamstring
},
{
    194.26,197.98
     in an area stage of view or basically new you have but you want to know and
},
{
    197.98,202.52
     what is the purpose of strengthening our hamstring and we basically want to
},
{
    202.52,208.84
     strengthen all the muscle around the knee and that could help you to recover quicker because if they get stronger
},
{
    208.84,212.48
     you actually can rely on those muscles and they can help you to actually move
},
{
    212.48,217.2
     easier. Let's give it a try and can give it a go. Now I'm going to show you from two
},
{
    217.2,221.36
     different angles. I'm going to show you from here you basically see that you're
},
{
    221.36,230.16
     trying to engage with your heel, just then go a little back. Just like that. You're trying to again go to the range that you feel
},
{
    230.16,236.08
     comfortable and as you can see I'm basically engaging some of the hamstring. It can relax the
},
{
    236.08,243.6
     other knee, slow control. If you push the knees more basically like the heels more towards the
},
{
    243.6,245.16
     ground you can get more
},
{
    245.16,249.48
     engagement of your hamstring. Now as you can see I'm going for a partial
},
{
    249.48,253.64
     range I'm not going for full range if you find it comfortable you can go for
},
{
    253.64,259.56
     all the way down slow control back. Now I'll show you from the other side you can
},
{
    259.56,267.28
     see in both ways I'm relaxing my, pushing through the heel and back again. Slow
},
{
    267.28,273.26
     control and back again. Now as I mentioned on the first and the second
},
{
    273.26,278.3
     exercise, you don't want to push the knee too much. If you find you can only do up
},
{
    278.3,283.96
     to here and coming back is actually difficult, you can do partial range. Go
},
{
    283.96,285.28
     for a partial range
},
{
    291.36,292.32
     Until the knee feels better and you can slowly progress it same as the second exercise you can try it for
},
{
    296.7,297.32
     Three sets of eight to ten slowly build up guys. Give it a go
},
{
    300.12,300.32
     The last exercise that you can do at home guys
},
{
    303.36,303.92
     You probably know by now that I'm a big fan of and squats
},
{
    308.0,312.72
     They can help you to and just move them and strengthen the knee at the same times. Now, if you haven't done the squats before or feel uncomfortable with them, you can start
},
{
    312.72,318.96
     with the seated squat, which means just pick up the seat and you don't need to go all the
},
{
    318.96,321.52
     way down and just have that as a support.
},
{
    321.52,325.0
     I'm going to show you from the other side as well which is
},
{
    325.0,331.32
     kind of like U22 basically slow and controlled if you find you're going all
},
{
    331.32,336.08
     the way up it's so don't go all the way up and if you find actually coming down
},
{
    336.08,340.32
     is when you're going for deep squat it's difficult don't go all the way down and
},
{
    340.32,346.32
     touch the table just have that as security if you lost your balance. Now, if
},
{
    346.32,351.68
     you find this is easy, how can you progress this? You can actually don't use a table.
},
{
    351.68,360.28
     Now, to progress this, I have some yoga basically block here. You can use this initially if
},
{
    360.28,369.36
     you find that you're losing your balance. They're pretty handy if you don't have these guys you can use towel or even a book underneath of your heel
},
{
    369.36,376.68
     and you're trying to get that basically balance. As you can see I don't shift my
},
{
    376.68,381.72
     body forward I sit back on my heels. I'm doing this let's say for partial move
},
{
    381.72,391.32
     I'm not going all the way down to here coming back and I show from the other side like literally you're trying to keep
},
{
    391.32,396.56
     the knees slightly wider than shoulder and slow control down as you can see I'm
},
{
    396.56,400.44
     pushing through the heels both heels but my foot is on the ground as well
},
{
    400.44,405.68
     still control down and coming back. Now these exercises can be a
},
{
    405.68,410.56
     progression maybe after you find out actually your knee has a good range of
},
{
    410.56,415.64
     movements and the swelling is down. Now we do have two protocols as well guys
},
{
    415.64,420.52
     in our website, police protocol and avoid harm. I'm gonna put the link on
},
{
    420.52,429.76
