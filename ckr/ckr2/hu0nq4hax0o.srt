     When you walk with crutches, it is important that you keep the crutches under your arms

{
    47.36,52.4
     and close to your sides. Squeeze the top of the crutches into your sides while putting

     weight on your hands and not through your armpits. This is the correct way.
},
{
    58.24,63.44
     This would be incorrect. Do not lean on the crutches with your armpits.

     Move the crutches forward 6 to 12 inches.

     Or you may bend at the knee of your injured leg if that is an option.

     The tips of the crutches and the healthy leg should always form a triangle.

     This will make you steadier and less likely to fall.

     This is the correct way.

     Check your balance before you continue to the next step.

     To go downstairs non-weight bearing with crutches,

{
    122.4,129.84
     start at the edge of the step, keeping your hips beneath you. Place crutches on the lower step holding the injured leg out in

     before you continue. Make sure you bend at your hip in need to prevent leaning

    139.4,145.28
     forward which could cause you to fall. If there is a sturdy handrail available,
},
{
    145.28,147.28
     hold both crutches under one arm
},
{
    147.28,149.76
     and use the handrail with the other arm.
