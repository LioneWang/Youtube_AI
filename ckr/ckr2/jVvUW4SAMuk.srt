     What's up guys?

     Hey, Jared Bechstrand here,

     Doctor of Physical Therapy, tonentighting.com.
},
{
    5.0,8.08
     Today we're talking all about foam rolling the IT band.
},
{
    8.08,10.6
     What that means, why you're probably doing it wrong,
},
{
    10.6,12.38
     and then give you some simple tips and advice
},
{
    12.38,13.88
     on how to do it the right way
},
{
    13.88,15.8
     in order to maximize your outcomes.
},
{
    15.8,17.76
     So let's get into it right now.
},
{
    17.76,20.76
     ["Ten Years Later"]
},
{
    31.04,34.44
     All right you guys, hey, thank you so much for joining me today here on Tone and Titan. As always, I'm excited to be able to share with you what I know about this topic, hopefully
},
{
    34.44,38.12
     help you out of some of the pain or discomfort that you guys might be experiencing.
},
{
    38.12,42.92
     Okay, so this IT band pain, it's typically manifest this pain on the outside of the
},
{
    42.92,43.92
     knee.
},
{
    43.92,45.1
     That's what people come in and complain about.
},
{
    45.3,46.8
     What the IT band is.
},
{
    47.0,51.9
     It's actually a big old thick tendon that runs down the entire outside the lateral
},
{
    51.9,53.1
     part of my leg.
},
{
    53.3,57.6
     It starts right up here at the hip, comes down the leg, crosses the knee joint,
},
{
    57.8,61.2
     wraps in and connects right up here kind of right by that tibia.
},
{
    61.5,65.84
     Now why this matters is when your knee is straight,
},
{
    65.84,68.2
     that tendon is actually in front of the knee joint.
},
{
    68.2,69.54
     When the knee is bent,
},
{
    69.54,71.72
     the tendon is actually behind the knee joint.
},
{
    71.72,74.6
     Now, if I do that over and over and over again,
},
{
    74.6,76.52
     you know, hundreds and even thousands of times
},
{
    76.52,77.6
     throughout the day,
},
{
    77.6,79.32
     what can happen is again,
},
{
    79.32,81.32
     if there's too much tension in that tendon,
},
{
    81.32,84.82
     it can cause this friction on the outside of the leg
},
{
    84.82,85.0
     as it
},
{
    85.0,89.56
     rubs over the bottom part of that femur, that femoral condyle down there.
},
{
    89.56,94.26
     That's what we refer to as IT band syndrome, and that's why you get it.
},
{
    94.26,97.64
     Everybody says, okay, if there's too much tension on the outside part of the leg, what
},
{
    97.64,101.56
     I need to do is decrease that tension, which is correct.
},
{
    101.56,105.6
     The problem that I run into is that most people do it like I'm showing you right
},
{
    105.6,111.92
     here. It's just kind of this all over approach. I'm rolling up, I'm rolling down, I'm doing it quickly.
},
{
    111.92,117.28
     There's a lot of things about this that are wrong that we can correct if we have a little bit better
},
{
    117.28,121.52
     understanding of some of the anatomy. Let's be honest, you guys, if we're going to foam roll,
},
{
    121.52,127.04
     if we're going to do anything, let's do it the right way. Let's maximize our outcomes, let's maximize our time.
},
{
    127.04,129.84
     Doing it correctly is actually gonna cut down on healing time,
},
{
    129.84,132.62
     get you back to doing that sport or that activity,
},
{
    132.62,135.26
     or even just walking around pain-free quicker.
},
{
    135.26,136.72
     And that's what we're all about.
},
{
    136.72,138.42
     And so let's spend some time,
},
{
    138.42,141.6
     let's figure out how we can actually maximize our outcomes.
},
{
    141.6,144.0
     The thing about the IT band is, you guys,
},
{
    144.0,145.52
     it's a tendon, it's not contractile. People say I just need to thing about the IT band is, you guys, it's a tendon. It's
},
{
    145.52,150.64
     not contractile. People say, I just need to stretch out my IT band. Absolutely wrong.
},
{
    150.64,155.48
     There's no way you can stretch a tendon. When tendons stretch, that's called a tear. And
},
{
    155.48,160.08
     all of a sudden that's tendonitis and tendinosis and all these other medical terms. We can't
},
{
    160.08,168.72
     stretch a tendon. It's not designed to stretch. Where we need to focus and the whole key to this video is we're never going to be able to stretch the tendon
},
{
    168.72,173.8
     but we can loosen up and lengthen all of the muscles that act on that tendon
},
{
    173.8,177.6
     and that's where we need to focus. We need to be a little more intentional with
},
{
    177.6,182.56
     our exercises on some of those muscles that act on the IT band in order to
},
{
    182.56,185.16
     loosen those up. So what are those muscles?
},
{
    185.16,186.44
     What are those areas that we need
},
{
    186.44,188.18
     to start to focus on a little bit more?
},
{
    188.18,189.8
     Let's put them up right over here.
},
{
    189.8,191.52
     You've got four areas that you're gonna need
},
{
    191.52,194.12
     to focus on you guys that contribute to that tightness.
},
{
    194.12,196.98
     Your tensor fascia latte is just a little teeny,
},
{
    196.98,199.2
     tiny muscle, sits from the anterior hip,
},
{
    199.2,200.92
     kind of that front part of the hip bone.
},
{
    200.92,202.6
     It's only about this big,
},
{
    202.6,205.72
     but has a significant impact on that entire IT
},
{
    205.72,210.12
     band. That one especially tends to get tight. If you've got tight hip flexors or if you
},
{
    210.12,213.8
     experience tightness in that area right there, that's going to contribute to some of that
},
{
    213.8,218.44
     IT band tension and some of that IT band pain down at your knee. Another muscle is that
},
{
    218.44,222.72
     glute max comes from the back, wraps around, connects into the outside of the IT band.
},
{
    222.72,225.36
     Now most of the time time it's actually weakness in
},
{
    225.36,230.0
     the glute max that contributes to this instead of tension in the glute max so keep that in mind.
},
{
    230.0,234.72
     But then we've got two more muscles. We've got our lateral quad so it's that vastus lateralis muscle
},
{
    234.72,239.68
     comes down the outside of our leg actually some of those fibers will feed into that IT band
},
{
    239.68,243.84
     and then we've got our biceps femoris or that lateral hamstring muscle that comes down
},
{
    243.84,245.88
     also feeds into that IT band.
},
{
    245.88,250.88
     Some of those fibers from the back can actually contribute to tension down in that knee joint
},
{
    250.88,251.88
     itself.
},
{
    251.88,256.72
     So those four muscles, if we're going to foam roll, we need to focus on those muscles and
},
{
    256.72,259.66
     their attachment site into the IT band.
},
{
    259.66,260.92
     Muscles are contractile.
},
{
    260.92,267.22
     If we can promote more length and more relaxation in those muscles we are therefore going to decrease tension in the IT band and
},
{
    267.22,271.4
     hopefully help that area to feel better. And so let me show you guys how to do it.
},
{
    271.4,275.8
     I'm gonna grab my foam roller and let's run you through it right now. Alright so
},
{
    275.8,278.92
     obviously if we're gonna foam roll our IT band the first thing we're gonna need
},
{
    278.92,284.44
     is a foam roller. Now most gyms will have these available. If you guys don't have
},
{
    284.44,285.16
     one of these at
},
{
    285.16,289.64
     home, I do recommend them as a physical therapist. This is a piece of equipment
},
{
    289.64,294.0
     that I use all the time. This is the one that we have at our house. It's one that
},
{
    294.0,297.56
     we use all the time between my wife and I. Someone's foam rolling something
},
{
    297.56,301.48
     like almost every day with this you guys. What I'll do is I'll put a link down in
},
{
    301.48,304.96
     the description below. If you don't have one, they're super cheap. This one is a
},
{
    304.96,308.62
     six inch diameter and a 36 inch length.
},
{
    308.62,311.36
     If you need a foam roller, check it out in the link down below.
},
{
    311.36,316.8
     Okay, so again, those four muscles that I told you guys about, that's where we need to focus
},
{
    316.8,317.8
     on.
},
{
    317.8,321.5
     We need to focus on foam rolling those muscles and their connection points with the IT band
},
{
    321.5,324.16
     in order to decrease tension in the IT band.
},
{
    324.16,325.48
     So let's go from the top to the bottom.
},
{
    325.48,327.64
     So we're gonna start with that little one up top,
},
{
    327.64,330.12
     the TFL, the Tensor Fascialate.
},
{
    330.12,332.48
     When I foam roll on these areas, what I'll do,
},
{
    332.48,335.66
     I'm gonna foam roll my right leg for you.
},
{
    335.66,337.42
     My left leg comes over the front
},
{
    337.42,338.8
     and is down on the ground.
},
{
    338.8,341.2
     That adds a key point of stability
},
{
    341.2,342.88
     that just provides a little more control
},
{
    342.88,344.52
     while you're in these areas.
},
{
    344.52,348.68
     And so that muscle, that Tensor Fascialcia latte sits right here on the front of my hip.
},
{
    348.68,351.36
     In order to get to it, I'm actually going to roll.
},
{
    351.36,354.12
     I'm going to bring my left hip forward towards you guys.
},
{
    354.12,359.84
     And now that foam roller is right on the front and top of my right hip.
},
{
    359.84,362.12
     And that's where I'm going to spend my time.
},
{
    362.12,365.08
     Now you might find a spot where it's particularly painful,
},
{
    365.08,366.68
     where it feels like there might be a little bit more
},
{
    366.68,368.0
     of a knot in there.
},
{
    368.0,370.44
     What I want you to do is spend some time on that.
},
{
    370.44,373.24
     Spend about 10 seconds on that spot
},
{
    373.24,374.92
     until it kind of releases.
},
{
    374.92,377.52
     That will be true for all these areas that I show you.
},
{
    377.52,381.44
     So that's the TFL or that Tenser Fashion Latte right there.
},
{
    381.44,383.64
     Again, about 10 or 15 seconds.
},
{
    383.64,385.52
     If you find a spot that's tight, I want you to spend 60 seconds right there. Again, about 10 or 15 seconds. If you find a spot that's tight, I want you
},
{
    385.52,391.84
     to spend 60 seconds total there. Now, the glutes, the way that I like to foam roll glutes is,
},
{
    391.84,396.48
     again, I'm going to be working on that right side. I'm going to sit down on my foam roller.
},
{
    396.48,402.64
     Right leg crosses over the left, kind of puts those rotators on a little bit more of a stretch.
},
{
    402.64,409.92
     And now what you can do is come up and down right on top of those glutes to roll those out. Again find a spot
},
{
    409.92,414.28
     sit there for 10 or 15 seconds and then roll the rest of the way out of it. We're
},
{
    414.28,418.24
     acting on the muscles that connect to that IT band rather than just the whole
},
{
    418.24,423.6
     IT band itself. Quads will be the next one so that vastus lateralis in order to
},
{
    423.6,425.84
     do that I want to roll forward
},
{
    425.84,429.28
     so that I'm actually focusing and biasing that pressure
},
{
    429.28,430.96
     onto that quad muscle.
},
{
    430.96,433.72
     And so my hip comes towards you guys again,
},
{
    433.72,436.56
     and now in this position, I can come,
},
{
    436.56,438.36
     and hopefully you guys can see that on the camera.
},
{
    438.36,439.96
     I'll come down here a little bit more.
},
{
    439.96,442.86
     And so now what I can do is actually focus
},
{
    442.86,446.92
     on that entire length of that vastus lateralis, that quad muscle.
},
{
    447.24,452.32
     The goal is to release the tension in the muscle that is acting on the IT band,
},
{
    452.52,454.68
     not necessarily the IT band itself.
},
{
    455.04,458.84
     Spend about 60 seconds on the, on the quad, on the vastus lateralis.
},
{
    459.14,462.44
     And then finally we're going to do the same thing with the biceps femoris.
},
{
    462.96,466.0
     For this one, my left leg is going to come behind my right leg.
},
{
    466.0,468.2
     It's no longer in front like it's been.
},
{
    468.2,474.0
     And then the emphasis is on the backside of the IT band, right in that connection point.
},
{
    474.0,477.2
     And that one's a little bit more stiff on me, you guys.
},
{
    477.2,481.2
     That spot right there, about 10 to 15 seconds on that spot.
},
{
    481.2,484.48
     And then we can roll off it about 60 seconds total.
},
{
    484.48,486.8
     So between those four areas
},
{
    486.8,491.64
     we're trying to influence all of the muscles that are going to attach to that IT BIM. Between
},
{
    491.64,495.76
     those four areas you're going to spend about 60 seconds in each one of those four minutes
},
{
    495.76,500.0
     total. I would do that on the right leg if you're experiencing these symptoms on the left.
},
{
    500.0,508.72
     Also, you obviously want to do that one as well. Now here's the thing, just foam rolling this is going to eliminate a lot of tension in
},
{
    508.72,513.92
     these areas, but chances are that tension is going to come back unless you do some of
},
{
    513.92,515.6
     the important steps afterwards.
},
{
    515.6,517.92
     The stretching and the strengthening.
},
{
    517.92,523.4
     So there are key stretches and there are all key hip strengthening exercises that I want
},
{
    523.4,524.4
     to run you through.
},
{
    524.4,525.6
     However, for the purposes of
},
{
    525.6,530.24
     this video, I just wanted to show the foam roller. If you're interested and I highly suggest you do
},
{
    530.24,534.88
     it, you need to check out part two in this series, the best exercises, the best stretches and
},
{
    534.88,540.0
     strengthening exercises for IT band syndrome. Here is where you're going to start. Afterwards,
},
{
    540.0,543.76
     you're going to stretch, you're going to strengthen it so that the symptoms don't come back. This is
},
{
    543.76,548.64
     going to take care of the symptoms, but then we need to do the next step so that symptoms don't come
},
{
    548.64,555.04
     back. Now to give you a little teaser of my absolute favorite IT band stretch, if I'm still working
},
{
    555.04,561.68
     that right side over, I'm going to lay down on my left. I'm going to grab my leg here. I'm going to
},
{
    561.68,565.32
     pull back this way. So all of a sudden that quad is on a
},
{
    565.32,569.52
     good stretch that way and then I'm going to with my left leg hook my right knee
},
{
    569.52,573.96
     and then I'm going to push that use my left heel to push right down towards the
},
{
    573.96,578.28
     ground. All of a sudden we get a big quad stretch, we get a good TFL stretch and
},
{
    578.28,582.64
     then as we come down we're actually working that adduction to stretch hip
},
{
    582.64,585.54
     abductors out. Probably my favorite IT
},
{
    585.54,589.6
     band stretch. You would hold that for 20 seconds. You would repeat that three
},
{
    589.6,593.54
     times. Check the description down below. I'm also going to float a link right up
},
{
    593.54,597.52
     here for you guys. That's going to take you to step two of this. Stretches and
},
{
    597.52,601.04
     strengthening exercises you can do right at home. No equipment required in
},
{
    601.04,605.06
     order to heal this IT band syndrome that you guys are
},
{
    605.06,608.72
     experiencing. So I hope that helps you guys out. I hope now you understand a
},
{
    608.72,612.92
     little bit better how to foam roll your IT band and the goal here is to just make
},
{
    612.92,617.12
     you guys more effective, get you healed faster to get you back what you love to
