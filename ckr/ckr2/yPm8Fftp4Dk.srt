     Welcome.
},
{
    16.0,18.36
     Hundreds of emails are flowing in.
},
{
    18.36,19.64
     All about the neck.
},
{
    19.64,23.96
     People crack on their neck, stretch their neck and wondering what they're doing to themselves
},
{
    23.96,29.12
     when they're hearing the videos or kind of panicking, getting scared.
},
{
    29.12,33.36
     They're asking questions, doc, how do I stop cracking my neck?
},
{
    33.36,35.16
     I've been doing this for years.
},
{
    35.16,38.08
     I'm developing these problems neurologically.
},
{
    38.08,42.04
     I continue to have this chronic problem that I used to have is getting worse, tingling
},
{
    42.04,44.64
     or burning into the arm or hands.
},
{
    44.64,45.88
     The symptoms are getting worse. Tingling or burning into the arm or hands. The symptoms are getting worse.
},
{
    45.88,47.66
     What do I do?
},
{
    47.66,50.4
     Well, you're going to stop.
},
{
    50.4,52.72
     And I'm going to tell you some ways
},
{
    52.72,55.6
     and different alternative things that you can do
},
{
    55.6,57.36
     to combat this problem.
},
{
    57.36,60.0
     But I need to give you a quick review for our new listeners.
},
{
    60.0,61.84
     We have a normal curve in the neck.
},
{
    61.84,63.4
     Between the neck, we have discs.
},
{
    63.4,65.8
     We have nerves that come out between the levels of the spine.
},
{
    65.8,69.04
     They control the different areas throughout the entire body.
},
{
    69.04,73.0
     The nerves in the neck primarily control the back of the head, the shoulders down the arm
},
{
    73.0,75.44
     into the hand, the chest between the shoulder blades.
},
{
    75.44,80.32
     Obviously, the nerves control different organs and muscles as you make its way down.
},
{
    80.32,85.16
     But for our sake, people that are just taking their head and pulling it over and just yanking
},
{
    85.16,87.16
     their head, you're stretching ligaments.
},
{
    87.16,89.04
     The ligaments hold bones together.
},
{
    89.04,90.72
     There are muscles in here.
},
{
    90.72,96.12
     If the muscles, in order for the muscles to work correctly, those ligaments got to be
},
{
    96.12,97.12
     tight.
},
{
    97.12,100.88
     If you take a rubber band and you overstretch it like you just crack it and stretch it,
},
{
    100.88,103.84
     the ligaments become loose, putting more stress on the muscles.
},
{
    103.84,107.68
     The muscles start to contract when they contract and get tight it gives you the
},
{
    107.68,113.12
     urge to want to pull again and the more you pull the more stretching you are
},
{
    113.12,119.08
     making in the same area of the neck so the big question is how do I get rid of
},
{
    119.08,124.16
     this these are the things you need to do when the next urge comes what I like
},
{
    124.16,125.92
     you to do is take your head
},
{
    125.92,129.16
     and I'd like you to bring your chin down to your chest
},
{
    129.16,131.28
     and bring it all the way down.
},
{
    131.28,133.28
     Let your head fall.
},
{
    133.28,136.48
     As you fall, you'll feel stretching behind the neck muscles
},
{
    136.48,138.0
     and just kind of lean it to the right
},
{
    138.0,139.68
     as you let it fall forward.
},
{
    139.68,142.24
     You'll feel muscles pull on the other side.
},
{
    142.24,143.78
     Then you go the other side.
},
{
    143.78,145.04
     You'll feel the other muscles pull behind the back of the neck and go the other side. You'll feel the other muscles pull
},
{
    145.04,150.08
     behind the back of the neck and shoulders. I want you to get in the habit of using the weight of
},
{
    150.08,156.48
     your head, the 12 pound weight. And I like you just to let that neck go forward. What we're doing is
},
{
    156.48,163.52
     we're stretching those tight muscles naturally. And as we continue to continue to do that over time,
},
{
    163.52,166.48
     the body will start responding in a positive way.
},
{
    166.84,171.04
     The next thing I want you to do is do some light neck rolls. As we do light neck rolls,
},
{
    171.2,177.32
     we're taking different areas of the neck and those muscles and we are beading it. We're kind of like
},
{
    178.04,183.34
     pacifying it. We're saying, okay neck muscles, I know you want to be pulled on, but we're gonna do it gently.
},
{
    183.34,190.32
     So what we're gonna do is just do some nice clockwise neck rolls.
},
{
    190.32,192.76
     You can just do maybe about 10 or 12 of them.
},
{
    192.76,195.52
     Then you go counterclockwise.
},
{
    195.52,196.64
     Light neck rolls.
},
{
    196.64,200.32
     You may feel a little clicking and cracking in your neck but don't worry about that.
},
{
    200.32,202.48
     Just light neck rolls.
},
{
    202.48,203.48
     Very gentle.
},
{
    203.48,206.08
     Passify those muscles.
},
{
    206.08,207.88
     The next thing I like you to do,
},
{
    207.88,210.64
     I like you to take your fingers and clasp them
},
{
    210.64,213.24
     around the back of your neck like this.
},
{
    213.24,214.48
     And when you clasp them,
},
{
    214.48,216.52
     I want you to push into that neck
},
{
    216.52,219.04
     and squeeze that neck as you clasp.
},
{
    219.04,220.04
     Go ahead and squeeze it.
},
{
    220.04,221.44
     Now what I want you to do,
},
{
    221.44,223.4
     I want you to take your chin
},
{
    223.4,225.78
     and bring your chin to your chest
},
{
    225.78,228.52
     as you continue to squeeze those muscles.
},
{
    228.52,235.02
     And you'll feel those muscles kind of release and you'll hold it there about 30 seconds.
},
{
    235.02,240.88
     As you take deep breaths and blow it out, keep squeezing as you let your chin fall on your
},
{
    240.88,242.38
     chest.
},
{
    242.38,243.38
     Beautiful.
},
{
    243.38,247.64
     And you'll feel those deep muscles start to release.
},
{
    247.64,250.32
     You'll hold that about 30 seconds.
},
{
    251.4,253.2
     That's a great exercise.
},
{
    253.2,256.18
     We're targeting different muscles behind the neck
},
{
    256.18,259.44
     that attach behind the head that's going to release
},
{
    259.44,261.94
     to give you a lot of relief.
},
{
    261.94,264.72
     The last one I'd like you to do are chin tucks
},
{
    264.72,268.22
     and shoulder blade squeezes together.
},
{
    268.22,271.28
     The chin tuck, you're gonna keep your chin neutral
},
{
    271.28,274.58
     with the floor, do not flex your head forward or backwards.
},
{
    274.58,277.06
     And what you're gonna do is you're gonna tuck your chin in
},
{
    277.06,280.46
     just like this from the side, as if you have a double chin.
},
{
    282.28,283.12
     Okay.
},
{
    284.46,286.88
     You go forward and you come back.
},
{
    286.88,292.06
     Now at the same time when we do that, we're going to do our shoulder blade squeeze.
},
{
    292.06,296.84
     So we're going to pinch our shoulder blades back together towards the spine as we stick
},
{
    296.84,298.44
     the chest out.
},
{
    298.44,299.84
     So we're going to do it together.
},
{
    299.84,302.12
     We'll do like 10 or 12 of them.
},
{
    302.12,305.36
     So what we're going to do, we're going to bring the chin back,
},
{
    305.36,311.0
     stick the chest out, squeeze the shoulder blades. Good. Hold it for like two seconds,
},
{
    311.0,317.88
     three seconds, come back. Good. Chin tuck, squeeze the shoulder blades, three seconds.
},
{
    317.88,328.66
     You'll actually feel the abs stretch open a little bit too. Come back down. Back shoulder blades. Good. You hold it about three
},
{
    328.66,332.96
     seconds, do about 10 or 12 of those. Now what we're doing is we're doing the
},
{
    332.96,337.06
     chin tuck, bringing it back. That's going to stretch the suboccipital muscles
},
{
    337.06,341.86
     underneath the skull. It's actually going to work the deep neck flexors to have
},
{
    341.86,348.46
     better posture because generally we find a lot of people who cracked their neck have very poor posture, rounded shoulders and forward
},
{
    348.46,349.46
     head posture.
},
{
    349.46,354.08
     And at the same time when we do that chin tuck, we're going to squeeze those shoulder
},
{
    354.08,356.64
     blades back, lift the chest up.
},
{
    356.64,359.04
     So this is what it's going to look like from the side.
},
{
    359.04,360.04
     Okay?
},
{
    360.04,365.76
     As the chin comes in, it tucks, chest comes up, shoulder blades come together.
},
{
    365.76,367.68
     Three seconds, and you relax.
},
{
    367.68,373.78
     Again, chin back, double chin, shoulder blades together, chest up, good.
},
{
    373.78,378.0
     So by doing the chin tuck and the shoulder blades squeeze, we're not only helping forward
},
{
    378.0,382.12
     head posture, we're strengthening the deep anterior neck flexors.
},
{
    382.12,385.12
     We're actually contracting the upper traps as well as utilizing
},
{
    385.12,389.2
     the back of the muscles that go behind the skull. We're working actually the scaleness
},
{
    389.2,394.4
     muscles as well as the sternocleidomastoid, the SCM muscles, and we're actually contracting
},
{
    394.4,399.56
     them. We're utilizing different muscles. This is a great little stretch. Now, do all
},
{
    399.56,403.72
     those stretches. You could do one after the other and that's really going to help you.
},
{
    403.72,405.56
     You can do this several times a day.
},
{
    405.56,407.36
     But now here's the key thing.
},
{
    407.36,411.56
     Within 21 days, your subconscious mind will break that habit.
},
{
    411.56,415.88
     This is a habit you've been doing for a long time and you can't afford that because if
},
{
    415.88,421.72
     you start degenerating discs causing osteoarthritis, pinched nerves and this, this degeneration
},
{
    421.72,425.92
     as well as herniated discs, this is going to give you a lot of problems in the future.
},
{
    425.92,428.0
