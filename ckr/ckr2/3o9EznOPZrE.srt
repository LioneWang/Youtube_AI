     We can be smart healthcare consumers and we can also at times be surprising healthcare providers,

     choking, forth-leading cause of unintentional injury death in the U.S. It can obviously happen to
},
{
    10.56,15.36
     anyone, anywhere. But would you know what to do if you found yourself in that situation?

     This recently happened at a Wisconsin high school. Everything was caught on tape as you're watching
},
{
    20.0,28.08
     here. So during lunch at Central High School in La Crosse Woods, Conson freshman Ian Brown noticed his classmate, Will Olson, was choking.
},
{
    28.72,34.48
     Other classmates at the table thought it was all a joke. Will was joking around. No, he wasn't.
},
{
    34.48,40.32
     Thankfully Ian had recently taken a safety class at their local police station and as you see was

{
    40.32,47.0
     able to correctly perform the Heimlich and ultimately potentially saved Will's life.
},
{
    47.0,51.0
     And the thing you have to understand is that if you are, if you have an object blocking your airway,
},
{
    51.0,57.0
     you can't talk. And so people say, are you kidding? Oh, stop kidding, stop kidding.
},
{
    57.0,63.0
     But you're in an extreme situation, can't breathe, can't talk because the air can't come out of your airway.
},
{
    63.0,67.0
     And so the American Red Cross recommends this five and five.
},
{
    67.0,71.24
     Five back thrusts, followed by five abdominal thrusts.
},
{
    71.24,72.56
     And then you can alternate those.
},
{
    72.56,78.64
     And the takeaway here is we often don't think we'll find ourselves in an emergency situation,
},
{
    78.64,80.48
     but that's why they call them emergencies.
},
{
    80.48,82.16
     They're unpredictable.
},
{
    82.16,84.08
     They can occur at any given time.
},
{
    84.08,88.96
     Well, just know what to do because 95% of deaths from choking occur in the home environment.
},
{
    88.96,90.64
     So, yeah.
},
{
    90.64,94.48
     You can actually give yourself the Heimlich too if you are choking in your alone.
},
{
    94.48,100.92
     You find a sturdy chair and if you are able to press in that area, you can potentially
},
{
    100.92,104.48
     get enough air out of your lungs and that air coming out of your lungs is what expels
},
{
    104.48,106.28
     that object.
},
{
    106.28,107.76
     Certainly an emergency.
},
{
    107.76,110.84
     Proud, proud of Ian Brown in this scenario.
},
{
    110.84,111.92
     Kudos to you, you all.
},
{
    111.92,112.76
     I mean, I'm not.
