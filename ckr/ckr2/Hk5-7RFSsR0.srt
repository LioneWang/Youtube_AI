     Hey guys, Dr. Bang here again.
},
{
    7.72,11.08
     I wanted to share with you some easy things you can do for your neck pain that you're
},
{
    11.08,13.32
     experiencing.
},
{
    13.32,17.84
     If you're at home working at your computer and you're not at a normal, the right desk
},
{
    17.84,21.04
     height, it might be aggravating your neck pain really bad.
},
{
    21.04,25.0
     So these are some easy tips that you can start into practice right this second.
},
{
    25.0,28.8
     So follow along with me and let's see if this is the right video for you.
},
{
    28.8,32.58
     It should start to alleviate your symptoms and you continue to do it throughout the next
},
{
    32.58,35.12
     week and it can greatly reduce those.
},
{
    35.12,40.6
     So I'm going to focus on if you have pain that kind of runs down one side of your neck.
},
{
    40.6,42.72
     So let's discuss the myofascial component first.
},
{
    42.72,45.24
     This is what we always do first we try to work it out.
},
{
    45.24,50.06
     So if you've got a line of pain, all you do is just take your thumb or your fingers and
},
{
    50.06,55.4
     just follow that line of pain as far as you can go until it stops hurting.
},
{
    55.4,56.4
     Okay?
},
{
    56.4,57.52
     I want you to push with moderate force.
},
{
    57.52,59.48
     You should cringe a little.
},
{
    59.48,60.8
     It might make your skin a little red.
},
{
    60.8,61.8
     That's normal.
},
{
    61.8,67.0
     I'm trying to work out that tissue that's tight.
},
{
    68.4,73.58
     Let's say you have more pinpoint pain, like it hurts right here. You can use your own
},
{
    73.58,78.7
     hands and push down, but sometimes I will get a massage cane and there's lots of different
},
{
    78.7,83.54
     types, I don't specifically ascribe to one brand. It's just some kind of curve with a
},
{
    83.54,86.32
     knob on it. You push
},
{
    86.32,90.62
     down with some moderate force right on that little spot that hurts in your neck.
},
{
    90.62,94.58
     It could be even up in the top of the neck, the base of the skull. You can
},
{
    94.58,98.36
     use these things in here. If you don't have a cane, that's okay. Get your thumb.
},
{
    98.36,103.36
     Push right up in there and work through that. Once you've done this for about a
},
{
    103.36,105.08
     minute, we're going to move to the
},
{
    105.08,109.8
     next component which is our range of motion. We have level one range of motion and level
},
{
    109.8,116.8
     two range of motion. Level one, watch my shoulders they're staying put. I'm going to be focusing
},
{
    116.8,129.6
     all my motion on the neck. I want to go as far as I can in these directions comfortably. Should not hurt.
},
{
    132.08,137.4
     I'm going to go one direction and then the other.
},
{
    139.0,140.16
     Three times each direction. That's level one.
},
{
    140.16,142.96
     Just warming it up, getting all the directions.
},
{
    142.96,146.8
     Then I want to contract my traps, my neck muscles,
},
{
    148.24,152.16
     and go through that same range. You see I'm shaking a little bit? It's normal
},
{
    153.44,157.52
     because I'm trying to contract the surrounding muscles while going through this range of motion.
},
{
    162.4,170.0
     Three times each direction, okay? Shouldn't hurt. If it hurts, let's say it hurts. I'm gonna hear, ah, just back off a little,
},
{
    170.0,172.0
     and continue your range of motion.
},
{
    172.0,176.0
     Avoid the pain, but take a mental note of where your pain is.
},
{
    176.0,186.4
     Next, we're going to expand the end ranges of motion of our neck and add resistance. So primarily, with most people,
},
{
    186.96,192.16
     it's here, both sides, and also here that they'll feel the most tightness. So that's what we're
},
{
    192.16,198.4
     going to focus on today. So you'll take your neck as far as it will comfortably go in one direction.
},
{
    198.4,206.0
     You're going to block it with your opposite hand. It's just going to hold the neck. Your hand is a wall to push against.
},
{
    206.0,213.2
     With my neck muscles, I'm pushing my head this direction. Feeling these contract. Hold
},
{
    213.2,219.96
     for 20. Then I'm going to try to push my head further down, but I'm going to block this
},
{
    219.96,229.14
     direction. Hold that for 20. Then I'm going to try to stretch a little deeper and
},
{
    229.14,250.04
     do another set. Pushing 1, 2, 20, pulling down. 1, 2, 3, etc. Same thing on this side. Block, push.
},
{
    250.04,253.96
     Push down for 20.
},
{
    253.96,257.44
     Three times each direction.
},
{
    257.44,259.64
     You finished lateral flexion.
},
{
    259.64,262.16
     Now we're going to do kind of lateral flexion with a little bit of variation.
},
{
    262.16,268.52
     So you're going to first again bring your ear to your shoulder and then look down towards the ground
},
{
    268.52,272.6
     and you'll feel it stretch change. And I'm going to block almost like I'm
},
{
    272.6,278.68
     lifting my head this direction. Blocking, holding, and when you're contracting I want
},
{
    278.68,283.36
     you to contract like moderately. You almost shake a little bit that's good. If
},
{
    283.36,285.64
     it's hurting back off just a touch,
},
{
    285.64,287.76
     but keep some pretty good force.
},
{
    287.76,291.92
     20 seconds, then I'm going to pull down 20 seconds,
},
{
    291.92,295.36
     working the other opposite muscles.
},
{
    295.36,298.48
     You can do that three times both sides.
},
{
    298.48,302.88
     Then the last thing we're going to do is just neck strengthening.
},
{
    302.88,306.92
     And that we're going to be doing is just some stabilization,
},
{
    306.92,309.96
     keeping our head in one position, pushing back
},
{
    309.96,315.72
     and doing an isometric hold in four directions.
},
{
    315.72,324.4
     Backwards to the right, to the left, and forward.
},
{
    324.4,326.08
     Notice how I'm looking straight forward.
},
{
    326.08,327.76
     I'm not moving at all.
},
{
    327.76,330.0
     I'm staying in one position.
},
{
    330.0,335.44
     A good time length is one minute per direction.
},
{
    335.44,336.44
     Moderate force.
},
{
    336.44,338.72
     It shouldn't hurt, but moderate force.
},
{
    338.72,340.8
     Try these tips for your neck.
},
{
    340.8,345.44
     If they don't work, look at some other videos on our channel that might be more specific
},
{
    345.44,346.44
     to you.
},
{
    346.44,350.24
     There's also greater detail and explanation on all the different components we're talking
},
{
    350.24,351.24
     about today.
},
{
    351.24,351.6
     Thanks.
