    10.28,15.52
     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist, Brad Heineck physical therapist, we are the most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    15.52,18.84
     In our opinion of course Bob, we're rejoined by Napoleon, boom apart
},
{
    18.84,21.04
     We haven't seen you in a while Napoleon, hope things have been going well
},
{
    21.04,28.72
     Today we're gonna talk about how to fix shoulder pain in seconds and this does work and I know because I'm actually using it on my shoulder right now
},
{
    28.72,31.56
     Right and now that we use it on our patients over the years
},
{
    31.84,35.16
     We just don't pick these things out of the air. All right before we do that

},
{
    46.64,51.44
     Bob and Brad because if you like us we will send some positive vibes your way here they come
},
{
    52.2,54.2
     Right through the lens
},
{
    54.52,62.64
     All right, so these are five exercises and how you can do this in seconds is I just want you to do one of these exercise
},
{
    63.48,67.4
     Sizes every few hours and it only takes you seconds to do it
},
{
    67.4,72.44
     So I'm not telling you to do, you know everybody's busy, you know nobody has time for pain
},
{
    72.44,78.36
     It's interesting. I just had one of our aides. She hurt her knee and she goes I don't have time for this
},
{
    78.36,82.6
     That's right. You don't have time for shoulder pain, so you don't have time to rehab it either
},
{
    82.6,87.64
     So I'm gonna show you things you can do throughout the day, maybe even in the office or wherever you work.
},
{
    87.64,92.08
     So you're gonna try all of these and only do the ones that's
},
{
    92.08,95.84
     successful because more than likely not all five will work on one person, it's
},
{
    95.84,99.76
     usually one or two are gonna be successful, so work with them.
},
{
    99.76,103.32
     Exactly, find the ones that are working for you and stick with it. And the thing
},
{
    103.32,105.24
     that we're trying to treat here mainly is
},
{
    105.52,113.52
     what we call impingement because impingement often leads to rotator cuff problems and I'd say about 80% of the shoulders that we see
},
{
    113.52,121.66
     Are having this difficulty right as a matter of fact our hanging book has studies saying this is the primary source of shoulder pain
},
{
    121.66,125.82
     And all of it but majority so very quickly we're going to show you what impingement is
},
{
    126.12,132.2
     So it often occurs from kind of poor posture leaning forward like this or being hunched forward
},
{
    132.2,136.82
     And what that causes is you have the humeral head here
},
{
    137.32,140.62
     and goes into the socket here or the glenoid fossa and
},
{
    141.28,146.8
     You have a tendon going over here. That's what this red thing is and if there's not enough room in there
},
{
    147.0,149.0
     What's gonna happen when you lift the arm?
},
{
    149.76,155.24
     It pinches. I don't know if you can catch that at all. I'm gonna show the healthy way is this.
},
{
    155.24,162.2
     You have a plant in there. The joint drops down where it's supposed to. The rotator cuff is doing what it's supposed to.
},
{
    162.56,169.32
     Unhealthy shoulder The rotator cuff is doing what it's supposed to, unhealthy shoulder Pinch and that's about where you get it, where your shoulders around 90 degrees it starts to pinch
},
{
    169.32,170.56
     Ouch, ouch, ouch
},
{
    170.56,176.56
     And what happens over time you start to saw away at that tendon and you can actually get a rotator cuff tear
},
{
    176.72,181.04
     You can tear on the muscle. I mean it just it throws everything off
},
{
    181.04,185.4
     So we got it these exercises are designed to get you a little more room in there
},
{
    185.4,190.1
     Right, so we eliminate that impingement or that squeezing pinching nasty
},
{
    190.1,193.72
     Oh, we painful. All right, the first one is the one that I've been doing I actually
},
{
    194.64,196.36
     Without going into too much detail
},
{
    196.36,201.58
     I have a little bit of winging on this scapula because I actually lost the muscle when I was younger. I had a nerve
},
{
    202.2,204.8
     Damage, maybe you could go find it. Yeah, maybe I could find it
},
{
    204.76,206.26
     I was younger I had a nerve damage, maybe you could go find it, yeah, maybe I could find it
},
{
    212.26,214.16
     But so this one tends to come forward more than the other ones, so I have to every so often I mean this is something you do throughout the day
},
{
    214.16,218.88
     You want to do shoulder squeezes and they're very easy to do you can do them no matter where you are
},
{
    218.88,222.74
     You can do them standing, you can do them sitting, and I'm just gonna go ahead bend my elbows
},
{
    222.74,226.68
     I'm gonna squeeze my shoulder blades together, You can see the wrinkling of his clothes
},
{
    227.36,233.36
     You know showing that that movement of the shoulder blades it from this side. Are you saying I just got my clothes out of the hamper?
},
{
    233.68,238.28
     Yeah, they're wrinkled you got to get them taken in Bob once again to the press
},
{
    238.6,243.92
     Yeah pressure on well not pressure on I'm sorry one two three four five. I usually do that you
},
{
    243.9,245.68
     Well, not pressure on I'm sorry one two three four five I usually do that you
},
{
    251.34,255.98
     Everyone's got their own little ways I just go hold and then kind of that's my mantra Hold by strengthening you might come over here Matt. I don't know I called you Matt, Brad
},
{
    257.1,259.02
     Matt's my son
},
{
    259.02,265.52
     By strengthening these muscles you're strengthening the core of the shoulder and that helps if these are held back
},
{
    265.52,270.64
     right here it puts the shoulder in the right position so instead of being like this they're
},
{
    270.64,275.84
     back like this and that's where you want them to be, they work much more efficiently and less pain.
},
{
    275.84,280.48
     The other the next technique so that's one I definitely want all of you doing that one
},
{
    281.2,288.64
     that's one I want you to slip in throughout the day. The next one is the Armulagin technique which we're a big fan of and you can just do this off
},
{
    288.64,294.52
     the back of a chair and again this helps set that humor ahead down in the socket
},
{
    294.52,301.08
     to give you more room for the tendon to glide through. Right, maybe you should do
},
{
    301.08,310.32
     with the other arm so they can see. So I'm right here I'm pushing down into the chair and while I push down into the chair I walk away
},
{
    311.32,317.2
     And this is my bad shoulder so this is the one I should be doing it on and I can feel this actually stretch really well
},
{
    317.48,322.64
     So you're kind of pushing not straight down this way, but down and kind of towards your toes
},
{
    322.84,324.92
     So it's kind of going that way
},
{
    324.92,325.68
     Straight down this way but down and kind of towards your toes so it's kind of going that way
},
{
    331.0,333.32
     You hear that crack? Oh, I didn't hear but I believe yeah, it's always louder to the person I have but you can see That's the reason why. I did hear that
},
{
    334.48,339.36
     Audible crepitus, that's what we call it in the field. So we're trying again
},
{
    339.68,346.38
     And it's a sneaky way of getting more motion and it's a sneaky way of getting more gap
},
{
    346.38,351.02
     With this technique if you're unable to do this, but you do this without pain
},
{
    351.02,354.8
     It's the right thing, but if I've had some patients do this and they didn't like it
},
{
    354.8,357.88
     It's painful and creates some sharp pain if that's the case
},
{
    358.32,362.18
     That one goes off the list we go to the next one. Did you want to show it with the bouillette?
},
{
    362.18,364.54
     Oh sure, no actually why don't you want to show Bob?
},
{
    364.54,367.36
     Okay, so if you did have one of our bouillette sticks
},
{
    367.36,369.7
     You could use the bouillette stick and you can actually
},
{
    370.08,376.6
     Actually, you can do it one of two ways you can walk away from it like this or you can also push down and move it away
},
{
    376.6,378.06
     Right
},
{
    378.06,383.56
     So either way but it works out really well to walk away and push down the entire time sure
},
{
    384.72,390.68
     You know if you don't have a bouastick and you don't want to buy, we've had people comment
},
{
    390.68,396.4
     they're using the broom handle or something. Yeah, absolutely. You got to do it on carpet or something so it sticks
},
{
    396.4,402.06
     That's what we have. We have a nice rubber in the back of a chair like we did. Next one is shoulder extension
},
{
    402.18,405.84
     So now we're gonna start working on bringing the shoulder back like this
},
{
    406.42,408.58
     Stretching this area out here again
},
{
    409.22,415.56
     Making more room for the shoulder to do its job to work correctly and we talked about people who
},
{
    416.28,421.88
     Started these Mulligan. He's a famous physical therapist. I think he's getting up there an age. I think he's still alive
},
{
    422.38,425.64
     He's got a whole system. This is McKenzie Techie
},
{
    425.64,431.36
     He's developed his own system as worldwide popular in the therapy world
},
{
    431.36,437.24
     So we're working on increasing the amount that the arm goes back. Brad, I thought you showed really well on the countertop
},
{
    437.24,443.04
     Yeah, if you want to, we've got a messy countertop. Oh look at that. We got an arm here. We got my glasses
},
{
    443.04,445.24
     We got a screwdriver. We've been busy today Bob
},
{
    445.64,449.14
     So you know in the early phase when your shoulders tight
},
{
    449.14,453.04
     You might just go up to the counter here and then get your good posture
},
{
    453.16,456.96
     And then you just squat gently and right now as I do that that
},
{
    457.34,464.2
     Extends my shoulder and you just go until you feel some pain not much then you come off it a little pain off
},
{
    464.64,466.48
     So we go to pressure on but not
},
{
    466.48,472.16
     into the pain you're never going to sharp pain when the range of motion starts to get better and
},
{
    472.16,477.76
     it's like oh this is getting much better much less pain along with that you're gonna find that going
},
{
    477.76,488.0
     in front is easier but to increase the more you open up the cupboard, some people say we got a crooked cupboard door on it. We tried to fix that too. So here we go and
},
{
    488.56,493.76
     now this is for high level, this is for someone whose shoulders is really doing well
},
{
    493.76,498.56
     They just want to get it to, you know, maybe they're a baseball thrower or you know pitcher thrower
},
{
    499.92,503.88
     Yeah, I'm in it today Bob. Tosser. Tosser, yeah. One way or another
},
{
    503.9,504.74
     Yeah, I'm in it today Bob. Tosser. Toss, yeah one way or another
},
{
    508.2,510.2
     There you go, so you can use other things in the house Yeah, things that just you know
},
{
    510.56,515.1
     End up being the right level for you go ahead and use it. Sure. All right next one again
},
{
    515.1,519.88
     You don't need to do all these I have all of you doing the shoulder squeezes with the other ones
},
{
    519.88,523.94
     I would kind of find out which one seems to be working the best for you decreasing your pain
},
{
    524.02,527.76
     This one's a really easy one you just use a belt and you're gonna go ahead and
},
{
    528.68,532.28
     Let's see how do we do this? This is a little challenging to get it set up
},
{
    532.28,537.88
     But yeah, there we go and the reason use a belt that is smooth and shiny because and you're gonna do it with clothing
},
{
    537.96,542.44
     And you'll find out why in just a second or sometimes if you have a little help, there you go
},
{
    542.44,544.44
     That's where I was trying to do
},
{
    544.96,546.92
     So this arm is relaxed
},
{
    546.96,552.0
     So we're trying to show you quite often what you're gonna find is the tight arm is down here
},
{
    552.24,554.78
     Where the other arm I can put way up here, right?
},
{
    554.78,558.04
     And so I want to get this arm up to that equal with that one
},
{
    558.24,564.2
     So you're just gonna go pressure on, pressure off. This belt really does work well. I know once you get it set up
},
{
    564.96,566.28
     Takes a little bit of doing
},
{
    567.04,569.04
     But it slides really well
},
{
    569.6,575.2
     As a matter of fact, we did a video a number of years ago on a patient that she was set up for shoulder surgery
},
{
    575.36,580.54
     And then she said can I do therapy and a surgeon said well go ahead and you can do it
},
{
    580.72,582.72
     Within four visits she was doing this exercise
},
{
    583.48,591.3
     No surgery needed. Her arm was going from here to here, canceled surgery and I still see her and it's still in good shape
},
{
    591.3,597.44
     Wow, yeah, there's some miracles every minute in the Bob and Brad clinic, right? There you go
},
{
    597.88,601.88
     All right, the last one we're gonna do is this one you're gonna need some equipment
},
{
    601.88,603.88
     I mean you need a place to hang
},
{
    604.32,606.28
     Brad and I have become big fans of this
},
{
    606.28,609.18
     I don't know do we have our book around you go ahead and start hanging
},
{
    609.18,614.82
     I think it's right up there by the prescription sunglasses or whatever, but are you over here Liz?
},
{
    614.82,618.56
     Don't don't worry about Bob. He's just looking through our library
},
{
    619.08,620.56
     quote-unquote
},
{
    620.56,622.92
     But yeah, you just need a hanging bar
},
{
    622.92,626.44
     Yeah, and you're just simply gonna relax and
},
{
    626.88,631.8
     Hang and we know when I first heard this I thought this is crazy
},
{
    631.8,635.72
     It's gonna make the impingement worse, but once I read the book understand the mechanics
},
{
    635.72,641.44
     And I start trying it and we start working with people doing it. It's like yeah, this this can be really a
},
{
    641.44,643.44
     We've become big fans
},
{
    643.76,649.7
     It's such an easy thing to do if you have the equipment and you can wear gloves make it easier. So the book is
},
{
    651.04,653.28
     Shoulder Pain, The Solution and Prevention
},
{
    654.28,657.2
     It's by John M. Kersh M.D.
},
{
    657.56,668.36
     We have it in our favorite books. Yeah, we do. He's an orthopedic surgeon, matter of fact he does his practice 30 miles from where I grew up in Wisconsin. Does he really?
},
{
    668.36,672.72
     Yeah, Steven's Point. Oh cool. My daughter went to Steven's Point. There you go.
},
{
    672.72,676.6
     This is a nice town. Got a river running through it and everything. Go to
},
{
    676.6,680.52
     Steven's Point too. There you go. So here you're gonna hang 10 to 30 seconds
},
{
    680.52,684.44
     depending on what you tolerate up to three repetitions of that and
},
{
    684.44,686.74
     depending on how you respond to it
},
{
    686.84,688.74
     The first time you do it might get sore
},
{
    688.74,693.92
     But after you do it for a few days you'll be able to do this two to three times per day and start to
},
{
    693.92,698.72
     We've really had good success and you still said seconds remember we promise seconds and yeah
},
{
    698.72,702.52
     So it's 30 seconds there you go out of your day and you can make a great
},
{
    702.52,705.2
     Oh, that's right. We've got to stick with our titles.
},
{
    705.2,708.12
     Alright, thanks everybody for watching. Remember we can fix just about anything.
},
{
    708.12,713.8
     Except a broken heart. There it is. But we're working on it. We'll never stop.
},
