     So the eye dominance test.
},
{
    2.04,5.56
     Well, in this video, we're going to show you how to test eye dominance so that you can
},
{
    5.56,8.16
     tell if you're left eye dominant or right eye dominant.
},
{
    8.16,9.64
     So let's take a look.
},
{
    9.64,10.64
     Hey, everyone.

},
{
    31.12,36.08
     that I go over. Otherwise, let's talk about eye dominance. So knowing eye dominance can be a really
},
{
    36.08,40.64
     important thing to know. I know for myself being an eye doctor, I need to know the eye dominance of
},
{
    40.64,46.66
     my patients in order to fit specialty contact lenses for mono vision as well as getting people ready for cataract surgery or
},
{
    46.82,54.28
     Even lazik eye surgery, but for just about everybody else knowing eye dominance can play a critical role for a lot of different activities
},
{
    54.64,60.4
     If you're somebody who wants to know eye dominance for shooting whether you're shooting a rifle or a shotgun
},
{
    60.4,64.14
     This can be really important, especially if you are cross-eye dominant
},
{
    64.2,64.6
     shotgun, this can be really important, especially if you are cross-eye dominant.
},
{
    68.32,68.4
     Also, if you are somebody who maybe wants to know eye dominance for archery,
},
{
    71.12,71.22
     or if you want to know eye dominance for pool or billiards,
},
{
    73.0,73.04
     this also can play a critical role.
},
{
    76.72,77.0
     Even photographers will shoot better if they know their eye dominance.
},
{
    79.12,79.14
     Now let's go over a couple of different ways where you can find out,
},
{
    81.04,81.28
     are you left eye dominant or right eye dominant?
},
{
    84.56,89.28
     So my favorite way to test eye dominance is using a distant object. So wherever you are just look in the distance find something that you can focus on. Here in the clinic as an
},
{
    89.28,93.44
     example we're going to go ahead and use the eyeball in the eye clinic logo. So while you're
},
{
    93.44,97.76
     focusing on that distant object with both eyes open you're going to go ahead and make your hands
},
{
    97.76,102.24
     into a big triangle like you're going to catch a football. You're going to extend your arms and try
},
{
    102.24,105.84
     to get that triangle to be right over that distant object.
},
{
    105.84,113.34
     Then you're going to go ahead and make that triangle smaller and smaller over that distant object until you can just barely focus that object right in the middle.
},
{
    113.34,119.06
     While keeping that object focused in the middle of the triangle, you can either choose to close one eye, kind of like here.
},
{
    119.06,125.92
     I can close my right eye and while closing that eye, if you can still see the object, then the open eye is your dominant eye.
},
{
    125.92,130.04
     If you end up closing your dominant eye during this test, you'll actually see that the object
},
{
    130.04,133.84
     is no longer centered in the middle of the triangle, it's going to be off-center.
},
{
    133.84,136.56
     Another variation of the same method that I like a little bit more because it's a little
},
{
    136.56,140.72
     bit fun, and if you're someone who can't close your eyes individually, then it's going
},
{
    140.72,142.44
     to work a little bit easier.
},
{
    142.44,147.2
     Still keep that object in the middle of the triangle, but then slowly bring your arms back,
},
{
    147.2,148.56
     keeping your eyes open,
},
{
    148.56,151.44
     and threading that object through the triangle.
},
{
    151.44,154.08
     Eventually you'll end up threading that distant object
},
{
    154.08,157.36
     right up to the eye that you're more eye-dominant in.
},
{
    157.36,159.28
     Another way you can test eye-dominance
},
{
    159.28,161.84
     is using a plus magnifying lens.
},
{
    161.84,166.86
     And as long as both eyes are actually corrected at four distance, your doctor can use these
},
{
    166.86,171.04
     plus lenses to hold it over just one eye at a time while both eyes are open.
},
{
    171.04,174.86
     The eye that's more significantly blurred is the eye that is dominant.
},
{
    174.86,178.9
     So for me, if I cover my right eye here with the plus lens, I can still see out of my left
},
{
    178.9,181.66
     eye really well so things are still relatively clear.
},
{
    181.66,187.88
     But if I cover and plus and blur out my left eye, then no, things are really blurry and it's more difficult to see.
},
{
    187.88,191.24
     There's one other method using your thumb, where you basically find that same distant
},
{
    191.24,193.6
     object and try to eclipse it with your thumb.
},
{
    193.6,194.6
     Again, both eyes open.
},
{
    194.6,195.88
     It's kind of the same principle.
},
{
    195.88,200.84
     You either close or cover one eye, and the eye that can still eclipse the object, that's
},
{
    200.84,202.5
     the eye, that's dominant.
},
{
    202.5,209.24
     Most people who are right-handed are usually right-eyed dominant as well, just like left-handed people are usually left-eyed dominant as
},
{
    209.24,213.24
     well. I'm left-eyed dominant. And that's kind of strange that I'm left-eyed dominant
},
{
    213.24,217.92
     because I'm also right-handed. We call that cross-eye dominance. And for a lot of activities
},
{
    217.92,222.64
     in sports, this can make things difficult. I find archery to be very difficult for me
},
{
    222.64,226.36
     because I can't really focus with my right eye as well as my left eye.
},
{
    226.6,233.76
     However, there has been some arguments that athletes who are cross-eye dominant have an advantage in that they can actually focus on the ball or the target
},
{
    233.84,240.36
     easier with their opposite eye because their whole bodies are usually turned toward the opposite team. As in baseball,
},
{
    240.36,244.04
     you have your body turned toward the pitcher and you're watching the ball come toward you.
},
{
    244.2,248.92
     However, they've done statistical analysis and found that that's not necessarily true.
},
{
    248.92,251.44
     But is it possible to not have a dominant eye?
},
{
    251.44,252.72
     The answer is yes.
},
{
    252.72,254.96
     Some people actually don't have a dominant eye.
},
{
    254.96,257.6
     Both eyes work relatively really well together.
},
{
    257.6,260.8
     However, that's pretty rare and uncommon to see.
},
{
    260.8,264.36
     You can go ahead and test these methods out for yourself and go ahead and comment in the
},
{
    264.36,267.0
     section below, let us know which eye dominant you are.
},
{
    267.0,270.2
     Are you a left eye dominant, right eye dominant, or maybe neither?
