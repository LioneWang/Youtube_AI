     In this demonstration we will be exhibiting the correct measurement of a wound.
},
{
    10.4,16.12
     For wound measurement you will want to have a disposable paper or similar measuring device.
},
{
    16.12,22.7
     The measuring device is either a paper or plastic disposable measuring tape.
},
{
    22.7,27.16
     It is generally marked in centimeter markings with sub markings
},
{
    27.16,31.96
     in millimeters. A cotton-tipped applicator is useful for measuring depth
},
{
    31.96,37.08
     and checking for any undermining. This model demonstrates a wound. By
},
{
    37.08,42.56
     convention, the superior aspect of the wound would also usually coincide with
},
{
    42.56,45.12
     the head and the inferior aspect would be the
},
{
    45.12,46.12
     foot.
},
{
    46.12,51.56
     We measure length from a head to foot direction and width is measured from left to right or
},
{
    51.56,53.6
     right to left.
},
{
    53.6,58.0
     Depth is measured the maximum location of depth in the wound.
},
{
    58.0,63.56
     The left to right or right to left convention does not matter in terms of the documentation.
},
{
    63.56,65.46
     It is important, however, that
},
{
    65.46,71.24
     length and width are correctly measured and documented as the convention from head to
},
{
    71.24,77.8
     feet for length and left to right to width are important in being able to reproduce measurements
},
{
    77.8,86.0
     between measures. In this particular instance, we would start off by measuring the wound in the length dimension
},
{
    86.0,93.0
     where there is the maximum length of this wound of approximately 5.7 centimeters.
},
{
    93.0,101.4
     The width would then be measured at its maximum point of width, which is 2.5 centimeters.
},
{
    101.4,110.14
     The depth we then would determine by probing the wound with our cotton tipped applicator using the cotton end. We would probe all areas of the
},
{
    110.14,114.78
     wound to determine where the most depth was located. It appears to be
},
{
    114.78,119.54
     approximately in the middle of the wound. We then slide our finger down the
},
{
    119.54,125.68
     cotton tipped applicator to where it is flush with the intact skin, pinch the applicator at that
},
{
    125.68,133.44
     point and withdraw from the wound. This can then be laid over your measuring device and
},
{
    133.44,141.92
     the depth determined. In this particular instance, it appears to be 1.8 or 1.9 centimeters.
},
{
    141.92,146.16
     Once the length, width and depth of the wound has been measured, it
},
{
    146.16,151.76
     is important to then record any evidence of undermining and what the
},
{
    151.76,159.08
     dimensions of that undermining are. In determining undermining, gently probe the
},
{
    159.08,164.44
     wound with your cotton-tipped applicator circumferentially around the wound. You
},
{
    164.44,167.52
     can see that over on this side of the wound,
},
{
    167.52,170.52
     we are starting to see some undermining.
},
{
    170.52,172.36
     It appears that at this location,
},
{
    172.36,176.84
     the cotton tipped applicator slips deeper under the wound
},
{
    176.84,178.44
     than it does in any other point.
},
{
    178.44,181.8
     This would be the maximum area of undermining.
},
{
    181.8,188.88
     As you can see, by convention, the superior aspect of the wound or the head aspect
},
{
    188.88,195.4
     of the wound would be 12 o'clock. If we then progress clockwise around a clock face the area
},
{
    195.4,202.56
     of maximum undermining is approximately 10 o'clock. Similar to how we measured the depth of the wound
},
{
    202.56,209.8
     you would want to slide your finger down the cotton tipped applicator, pinch it with your nail, and then bring it up to your
},
{
    209.8,211.92
     measuring device.
},
{
    211.92,219.4
     In this particular instance, it appears that the undermining is approximately 1.7 centimeters.
},
{
    219.4,226.86
     As you will recall from the last image, the undermining is located at 10 o'clock.
},
{
    226.86,231.44
     This would be recorded as 1.7 centimeters of undermining at 10 o'clock.
},
