     There are two parts to your Jackson Pratt drain, the tubing and the bulb.
},
{
    28.0,32.4
     Before you empty the drainage bulb, you'll need to milk the tubing so it can drain properly.
},
{
    33.6,34.88
     First, clean your hands.
},
{
    36.32,40.88
     If you're washing your hands with soap and water, wet your hands, apply soap,
},
{
    40.88,48.52
     rub your hands together thoroughly for 15 seconds, then rinse.
},
{
    48.52,58.52
     Dry your hands with a disposable towel and use that same towel to turn off the faucet.
},
{
    58.52,63.64
     If you're using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, be sure to cover all of your hands with it,
},
{
    63.64,70.12
     rubbing them together until they're dry. Cleaning your hands properly, also called hand hygiene, is an important
},
{
    70.12,76.36
     part of caring for your drainage catheter. Now, look in the mirror at the tubing. Pinch
},
{
    76.36,81.86
     the tubing close to where it goes into your skin. You may want to use an alcohol pad to
},
{
    81.86,85.6
     make it easier to slide your fingers down the tubing.
},
{
    90.8,93.2
     With your thumb and forefinger of your other hand, pinch the tubing right below your other fingers.
},
{
    96.4,97.84
     Keeping your fingers pinched, slide them down the tubing.
},
{
    101.6,108.72
     Keep doing this until any clots are out of the tubing and into the bulb. Once all the clots are in the bulb, you're ready to empty it.
},
{
    111.76,112.96
     Unplug the stopper.
},
{
    115.44,118.48
     Then, turn the bulb upside down and gently squeeze it,
},
{
    119.76,122.32
     pouring the contents into the measuring container.
},
{
    123.0,128.7
     pouring the contents into the measuring container.
},

    131.7,134.7

},
{
    134.7,138.3
     and keep squeezing it while you re-plug the stopper.
},
{
    138.3,140.0
     The bulb should remain compressed
},
{
    140.0,143.5
     so that it provides continuous, gentle suction.
},
{
    143.5,146.12
     The stopper must be closed for the drain to work.
},
{
    147.88,149.62

},
{
    149.62,152.94

{
    161.48,163.04

    171.56,173.24
     If you have more than one drain,
},
{
    173.24,176.6
     measure and write down each one separately.
},
{
    176.6,179.28
     Remember, the color and consistency of the drainage
},
{
    179.28,180.12
     will vary.
},
{
    180.12,183.92
     It might be dark red, the color of cranberry juice,
