     Hi, my name is Miles.

{

     Welcome to Best Practice Medicine TV.
},
{
    10.32,15.24
     Today we're going to be talking about extremity splinting, specifically shoulder mobilization
},
{
    15.24,33.46
     using the sling and swath method. Extramity splinting is an important skill for all EMS providers, especially those working
},
{
    33.46,39.28
     in the backcountry setting such as wilderness first responders or ski patrollers.
},
{
    39.28,43.0
     Effective immobilization will reduce patient pain and decrease the chance of additional
},
{
    43.0,44.6
     injury during transport.
},
{
    44.6,48.8
     The sling and swath is used to immobilize injuries of the shoulder and upper and lower
},
{
    48.8,54.16
     arm in order to take weight off the affected tissues and neighboring anatomy.
},
{
    54.16,59.46
     The standard sling and swath is built using two triangular bandages or cravats and consists
},
{
    59.46,60.46
     of two parts.
},
{
    60.46,65.0
     A sling, which serves to take the weight of the injured extremity off of the shoulder joint
},
{
    65.0,70.0
     and a swath which binds the injured extremity of the patient's body further stabilizing it.
},
{
    70.0,76.0
     As with any extremity splinting, the first step is to manually stabilize the injured extremity.
},
{
    76.0,78.0
     Can you hold your arm there for me?
},
{
    78.0,80.0
     And to obtain an initial set of CSMs.
},
{
    80.0,84.0
     Checking for a pulse, sensation, what finger am I touching?
},
{
    84.0,85.6
     My thumb. Can you wiggle them for me?
},
{
    85.6,90.88
     Awesome. To construct your sling, first you need to make a pocket by tying a knot
},
{
    90.88,96.84
     in the right angle of the corner of your triangular bandage. The size of knot you
},
{
    96.84,101.92
     tie is determined by the length of the patient's forearm. A longer forearm will
},
{
    101.92,107.0
     require a smaller knot and a shorter forearm will require a longer knot.
},
{
    108.0,118.0
     The corner of the triangular bandage that's resting against the patient's body should go straight up to the shoulder that sits above the hand of the injured extremity.
},
{
    118.0,124.0
     This will form a suspension line and help adequately support the extremity.
},
{
    127.0,133.8
     form a suspension line and help adequately support the extremity. The side further away from the patient's body is wrapped up over the opposite shoulder,
},
{
    133.8,143.08
     minding the pocket, and effective, even tensioning of the splitting material all the way across.
},
{
    143.08,145.0
     Once the splitting material is properly positioned,
},
{
    145.0,148.0
     prepare to tie a knot around the patient's back.
},
{
    148.0,150.0
     Before you finish your knot,
},
{
    150.0,153.0
     pull up on the splitting material
},
{
    153.0,157.0
     in order to effectively take the weight off the extremity.
},
{
    157.0,159.0
     You don't want to displace the shoulder
},
{
    159.0,162.0
     so much that it causes the patient unnecessary pain,
},
{
    162.0,165.3
     but by pulling a little extra tension will
},
{
    165.3,168.7
     account for slippage in the knot and stretching and sagging of the material.
},
{
    168.7,174.26
     It's best to warn your patient that this step might hurt a little bit, but it'll
},
{
    174.26,179.82
     make them feel better, increase their comfort right away. Once the sling has
},
{
    179.82,183.1
     been applied, the next step is to immobilize the extremity of the patient's
},
{
    183.1,185.0
     body using a swath.
},
{
    185.0,189.0
     Surface area is your friend here, so a wider swath is better.
},
{
    189.0,199.0
     Position the swath material over the patient's arm and prepare to make a knot at the patient's back.
},
{
    199.0,205.4
     Before you tie your knot, ask the patient to take a deep breath for you to make sure you don't restrict their breathing.
},
{
    205.4,208.6
     Take deep breath, hold it, awesome.
},
{
    208.6,214.16
     Okay, you can let it out.
},
{
    214.16,220.28
     After the swath is tied, dress it to make sure it's effectively immobilizing the extremity
},
{
    220.28,228.46
     to the patient's body.
},
{
    228.46,234.64
     Wide coverage over the elbow and the hand, leaving the narrow parts on the patient's
},
{
    234.64,239.0
     back where it's less sensitive and less likely to bite in.
},
{
    239.0,243.94
     When practicing, test the effectiveness of your swath by asking your helper to bend over
},
{
    243.94,246.24
     forward and see if his arm swings
},
{
    246.24,251.36
     away from his body. Feel like you're swinging away? Nope, I'm pretty secure. Tight in there? Yep.
},
{
    255.28,260.0
     In order to be effective, a sling and swath should keep the patient's extremity immobilized
},
{
    260.0,265.04
     without dislodging, shifting or sagging, despite bumping, jostling or bouncing.
},
{
    272.48,278.56
     After splinting the extremity, recheck the patient's circulation, sensation and motion in the injured extremity.
},
{
    282.88,285.4
     Ready to pulse? We'll finger my touch in.
},
{
    285.4,286.4
     My thumb.
},
{
    286.4,287.4
     We'll give them for me.
},
{
    287.4,288.4
     Great.
},

    288.4,293.16
