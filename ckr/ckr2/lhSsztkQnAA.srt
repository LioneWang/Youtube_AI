     The hyphen chest seal is a self-adhesive occlusive dressing designed specifically for use in the

    25.92,30.92
     management of casualties with penetrating chest wounds. The hyphen utilizes the latest

    30.92,36.08
     specialized adhesive technology in order to achieve and maintain a superior seal under

{
    36.08,41.96
     the most adverse conditions. The hyphen is supplied in a rugged, easy-to-open foil package

    41.96,46.0
     that allows for quick and effective application in extreme environments.

{
    46.0,51.0
     After action reviews from numerous health care professionals identified the recurrent requirement

    51.0,56.0
     for an occlusive dressing that effectively adheres to a casualties chest wall,
},
{
    56.0,62.0
     the hyphen chest seal was developed, tested, and validated through an extensive collaborative effort

    62.0,70.16
     with these providers to achieve this requirement. The hyphen chest seal meets the committee on tactical combat casualty cares,

     current guidelines for managing all open and or sucking chest wounds.

{
    74.56,79.12
     A penetrating chest wound creates an opening in the chest wall

    79.12,83.0
     through which air may enter the chest cavity during the normal respiration cycle.
},
{
    83.0,89.28
     Commonly referred to as a sucking chest wound, this injury results in a condition known as
},
{
    89.28,91.48
     an open pneumothorax.
},
{
    91.48,95.98
     An open pneumothorax occurs when there is a persistent communication between the internal

{
    95.98,100.72
     thoracic cavity and the environment through a defect in the chest wall.
},
{
    100.72,105.14
     Though this interferes with normal physiological ventilation, it should not create a tension

    105.14,110.4
     pneumothorax as the intrathoracic pressure and the atmospheric pressure equalize across
},
{
    110.4,112.34
     the open wound.
},
{
    112.34,117.38
     A tension pneumothorax can develop with a sucking chest wound when the chest wall defect
},
{
    117.38,123.32
     creates a one-way valve in which air can be drawn into the pleural space but cannot exit.
},
{
    123.32,127.92
     Since the air cannot escape, the intrathoracic pressure increases and a life-threatening
},
{
    127.92,130.72
     tension pneumothorax can develop.
},
{
    130.72,136.04
     The initial management of an open and or sucking chest wound is to immediately apply an occlusive

{
    136.04,140.08
     dressing to cover the defect and secure it in place.
},
{
    140.08,145.06
     Traditionally, an occlusive dressing secured only on three sides has been used to seal

{
    145.06,150.4
     penetrating chest wounds to help in preventing a tension pneumothorax from developing.
},
{
    150.4,155.04
     Other types of chest dressings, some which contain pressure relief valves, are also in
},
{
    155.04,159.84
     use, but there is little clinical evidence to show that any of these, or even the traditional
},
{
    159.84,164.92
     three-sided dressings, are superior to a completely occlusive dressing placed over the wound

     Bleeding from the wound site, continued sweating, body hair, and other environmental contaminants

    172.76,177.84
     may significantly limit the effectiveness of adhesive devices not designed to overcome

    177.84,179.92
     these adverse conditions.

    179.92,200.52
     The hyphen chest seal was designed with superior adhesion capabilities to conquer these challenges.

     This casualty has sustained a penetrating chest wound to his anterior chest with no exit wound.
},

     His lung has collapsed and it is interfering with his ability to breathe.

     He requires the immediate application of a hyphen chest seal.

{
    214.64,219.4
     These wounds are rapidly treated by applying a hyphen chest seal during expiration,
},

    219.84,223.88
     placing the casualty in an upright position or in the recovery position and

     Position the casualty in either a sitting position or the lateral recumbent recovery
