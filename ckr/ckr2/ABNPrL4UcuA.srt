     My name is Dr. Storey. I've been a chiropractor for over 23 years. I'm going to give you realistic advice based on my experience, stuff that you can use.
},
{
    7.0,17.0
     Well, how do you know you've sprained your sternoclavicular joint? This is a rare sprain, but it does happen, and very often with chronic shoulder problems,
},
{
    17.0,25.18
     I find that the sternoclavicular joint is the thing that no one looks for, but sometimes the secret to getting people's shoulders
},
{
    25.18,26.34
     to feel better.
},
{
    26.34,31.44
     What you do is you have to take your shirt off, look at these bumps right here below
},
{
    31.44,32.56
     your throat.
},
{
    32.56,37.68
     So if you take your finger and you push in the soft spot of your throat, the bones are
},
{
    37.68,39.24
     right to the side.
},
{
    39.24,46.0
     And what you'll do is you'll take your fingertips and place them on the actual bones themselves and make sure
},
{
    46.0,47.36
     that they're level.
},
{
    47.36,51.84
     That's clue number one, you've sprained your sternoclavicular joint.
},
{
    51.84,56.84
     Number two, very often the joint will be tender to the touch, so when you touch it, it'll
},
{
    56.84,60.2
     actually feel like a little bit of a bogginess or swelling.
},
{
    60.2,65.0
     Last test that I do, and this is very difficult to do at home, motion palpation.
},
{
    65.0,67.2
     And what we do is there's two methods of doing it.
},
{
    67.2,71.8
     We can grab the sternoclavicular joint and push it down and up and see if it has good
},
{
    71.8,72.8
     motion.
},
{
    72.8,75.68
     The bone should actually move like this.
},
{
    75.68,79.96
     The second way, and I like to do it this way, is to place my finger on the joint, have
},
{
    79.96,86.08
     the patient raise their arm, and the sternoclavicular joint, the clavicle, will actually go down
},
{
    86.08,87.24
     and rotate.
},
{
    87.24,91.16
     It'll go down and rotate and you can actually feel that motion.
},
{
    91.16,97.0
     So when there's lack of motion there, very often other areas will try to compensate and
},
{
    97.0,98.48
     make up the slack.
},
{
    98.48,104.28
     So very often when a person has a shoulder problem, they have a C joint problems and
},
{
    104.28,106.52
     it's not resolving with normal type of
},
{
    106.52,112.8
     therapies, what we'll find is the person has an old injury to their sternoclavicular joint,
},
{
    112.8,117.72
     and how we know that is when they raise their arm, the bone doesn't go down and it doesn't
},
{
    117.72,118.72
     rotate.
},
{
    118.72,123.84
     So the adjustment, the chiropractic adjustment is to recreate that motion, so we'll adjust
},
{
    123.84,125.76
     it down and rotate it, and very often the person will get a full range of to recreate that motion. So we'll adjust it down and rotate it.
},
{
    125.76,128.48
     And very often the person will get a full range of motion
},
{
    128.48,129.78
     of their shoulder.
},
{
    129.78,131.24
     But that's how you know if you've had
},
{
    131.24,132.68
     a sternal clavicular joint.
},
{
    132.68,135.28
     It's very common, I see it a lot in my practice
},
{
    135.28,136.92
     because I see a lot of cyclists.
},
{
    136.92,139.88
     And cyclists, they fall in one of two ways.
},
{
    139.88,142.0
     They either fall with their arm outstretched
},
{
    142.0,144.74
     if they can do that, or very often they'll fall
},
{
    144.74,146.6
     and hit their shoulder like this.
},
{
    146.6,150.52
     If they don't break their collarbone, they're lucky, but sometimes they'll actually sprain
},
{
    150.52,152.4
     the sternoclevicular joint.
},
{
    152.4,156.76
     It also happens with, there's a local high school here and I treat a lot of high school
},
{
    156.76,158.0
     athletes.
},
{
    158.0,162.16
     Kids will fall on their shoulder, they'll be due wrestling.
},
{
    162.16,164.76
     Swimmers get it as well from repetitive motion.
},

    164.76,166.04
