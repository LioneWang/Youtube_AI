     Injuries that cause severe bleeding can ultimately kill you if not treated.
},
{
    6.0,10.0
     What I'm going to need is a willing volunteer.
},
{
    11.0,15.0
     Mark, go over to Alastair and he's going to give you a wound.
},
{
    16.0,18.0
     Yes, he's going to give you a wound.
},
{
    19.0,21.0
     But it won't hurt. It shouldn't hurt.
},
{
    22.0,26.32
     Alastair's going to make a very realistic looking wound on Mark's leg.
},
{
    26.32,31.6
     We're making it as convincing as possible as it's important not to be put off by what
},
{
    31.6,36.52
     a wound looks like and to think about what you can do to help the person in trouble.
},
{
    36.52,38.24
     Now that is looking nasty.
},
{
    38.24,41.84
     You certainly can't be walking around on an injury like that.
},
{
    41.84,43.36
     That looks pretty deep.
},
{
    43.36,46.56
     It looks like you may well have hit some vessels
},
{
    46.56,53.2
     and if you have then I'm expecting it to squirt a bit. Oh there we go. You have certainly
},
{
    53.2,58.76
     hit a vessel. If you see an injury like this for real, the first thing you should do is
},
{
    58.76,68.04
     call for help but then there are some easy steps you should take to help stop the bleeding. The first step is apply some direct pressure, okay?
},
{
    68.04,70.48
     So direct pressure on the wound.
},
{
    70.48,72.72
     If you've got a bandage, use that.
},
{
    72.72,74.72
     If you haven't, use a T-shirt.
},
{
    74.72,76.72
     Again, use whatever you've got.
},
{
    76.72,79.48
     You can see it's all still seeping through.
},
{
    79.48,82.12
     Mark, well done with the bag squeezing.
},
{
    82.12,87.92
     The key to stopping the bleeding is to apply the bandage quickly and firmly
},
{
    87.92,92.0
     and not disturb the surface of the wound where a clot might be forming.
},
{
    92.88,97.4
     Keep tying fabric around the wound until blood stops showing through.
},
{
    97.4,101.96
     The important thing though is to forget anything you've heard about tourniquets
},
{
    101.96,105.28
     or tying these bandages as tight as you can. What
},
{
    105.28,109.2
     essentially don't want to do is apply it so so tight that I can't get a finger in
},
{
    109.2,114.28
     there. I want to apply the amount of pressure that's going to work towards
},
{
    114.28,118.44
     stemming the flow but without cutting off the blood supply to the rest of your
},
{
    118.44,125.84
     foot. Once you've done all the bandaging you can, simply raise the wound up above the heart to help reduce blood flow.
},
{
    127.84,132.16
     Not all wounds are clean and neat though. If you're faced with a wound like this,
},
{
    132.16,139.28
     don't be tempted to pull the object out. That twig could actually be stemming the flow of blood.
},
{
    139.28,146.36
     By you pulling it out, you could be actually causing a mass bleed. The principle of how we're going to
},
{
    146.36,151.4
     treat that is ultimately the same. You still need to apply pressure around the wound so
},
{
    151.4,157.4
     build it up and then cover it over. Protect the object by putting anything you can find
},
{
    157.4,165.0
     either side of it then keep pressing down firmly to help stop the bleeding as you tie a piece of fabric over the top.
},
{
    165.0,171.0
     And just tie it tight, keep it secure and there you go. Mark, you feeling alright?
},
{
    171.0,172.0
     Yes.
},
{
    172.0,173.0
     Yeah, cool.
},
{
    173.0,176.0
     Finally, there's one more very important thing to look out for.
},
{
    176.0,182.0
     The thing that we worry about when it comes to serious bleed are people going into shock.
},
{
    182.0,188.0
     Shock is a very dangerous condition caused by not enough blood reaching the vital organs.
},
{
    188.0,193.64
     What I need you to look out for is some particular signs. If they become dizzy, they feel a bit
},
{
    193.64,201.64
     faint. If their lips go blue, if they become a bit pale, sweaty. If their breathing is
},
{
    201.64,206.0
     a little bit shallow and fast, these are all worrying signs.
},
{
    206.0,211.0
     Ensure the person is lying down with both legs raised to help blood flow to the brain and heart.
},
{
    211.0,216.0
     Keep them warm and notify the emergency services immediately.
},
{
    216.0,220.0
     By doing this, you'll have done everything you can to save their life.
},
{
    220.0,228.0
     Hopefully you'll never have to use these skills, but if you do, stay calm and don't panic.
},
{
    228.0,235.2
     Stop the bleeding by applying pressure. Call 999 as soon as possible. Lie the casualty
},
{
    235.2,239.2
     down and elevate the limb and look for signs of shock.
},
