     Hi guys, thank you for joining our program. In this video I'm going to show you all the
},
{
    12.68,18.04
     necessary technique that you need to be watching while you're doing these exercises to minimize
},
{
    18.04,23.64
     the rate of injury. If you have any questions regarding the exercises after watching this
},
{
    23.64,29.0
     video you can contact us through the email and we will get back to you immediately.
},
{
    29.0,31.0
     Let's go through them one by one.
},
{
    31.0,36.0
     The first exercise that I'm going to show you today, it's squat.
},
{
    36.0,45.3
     I'm talking about bodyweight squat and through this program you're going to go through a weighted squat as well. Now to learn the technique of squat, there are a couple of
},
{
    45.3,49.06
     points that I'm going to show you today that I would definitely advise you to go
},
{
    49.06,55.18
     through before you're doing it. The first thing would be your foot apart, how
},
{
    55.18,58.86
     wide it should be your squat. It should be very close or it should be very wide. I
},
{
    58.86,62.46
     would suggest shoulder apart or a slightly wider than your shoulder. That
},
{
    62.46,68.0
     would be the best actually for your contact, which would give you a full range to go and come back.
},
{
    68.0,70.0
     Now, in most cases,
},
{
    70.0,72.0
     people struggle actually to get to the deep squat,
},
{
    72.0,74.0
     and by this kind of point,
},
{
    74.0,76.0
     they're actually losing their balance.
},
{
    76.0,78.0
     How can you improve that?
},
{
    78.0,80.0
     With adding very small things,
},
{
    80.0,82.0
     such as, I'm using here as a dumbbell,
},
{
    82.0,84.0
     you can use books at home,
},
{
    84.0,87.0
     or a towel, that will do the job.
},
{
    87.0,98.0
     You can place those underneath of your heels and that actually helps you to get through a deeper range of squat while you're doing it.
},
{
    98.0,108.64
     Now, the second thing that you want to watch, how deep you should go. There is no actual way to do it. In fairness,
},
{
    108.64,113.6
     it's very personal. If you feel comfortable to go through deep squat and you can basically
},
{
    113.6,120.32
     maintain good technique, I would suggest to do so. If you're not, even up to 90 degrees,
},
{
    120.32,125.68
     that's perfect enough for us. And one other thing that people are watching usually when they do
},
{
    125.68,132.24
     squats they want to know where their back should be. Is their back should be in an optimal position
},
{
    132.24,136.8
     that the wall you're doing this squat. In reality we don't have an optimal position while you're
},
{
    136.8,142.56
     doing your squat because our back actually is going to flex anyway, our spine is going to flex
},
{
    142.56,150.44
     and you can't really avoid that which means as long as you're watching forward and keep your back nice and tall and you're not
},
{
    150.44,155.0
     trying to stand very stiff, you want to be relaxed and being able to breathe in
},
{
    155.0,161.24
     and out and being able to get to the good range. This couple of tips I would say
},
{
    161.24,165.34
     will help you actually to improve your squats. Now while you're
},
{
    165.34,169.8
     adding weights to the squats in this program you're going to use kettlebells.
},
{
    169.8,175.3
     If you have dumbbells at home I would suggest to make sure any type of weights
},
{
    175.3,180.44
     that you take keep that weights as close as possible to your body which means
},
{
    180.44,184.66
     your center of mass. If you're doing it side you can see actually I'm doing pretty
},
{
    184.66,190.16
     comfortable I'm not holding my hands up, relaxing my shoulder and basically going through the deep
},
{
    190.16,196.48
     squat and coming back. I'm not shifting forward, I'm sitting back on my hip and coming back upright.
},
{
    197.04,205.44
     Yeah, try this a couple of tips with any kind of equipment that you have at home, you can use it even in bottled water
},
{
    205.44,207.08
     as weights.
},
{
    207.08,212.16
     And if you've got any kind of question, get back to us and I will get back to you as soon
},
{
    212.16,214.4
     as possible.
},
{
    214.4,218.84
     The second exercise that I'm going to show you today, it's going to be calf raises, which
},
{
    218.84,224.4
     actually kind of works on our calf muscle at the back of our shin bone.
},
{
    224.4,228.32
     Now for calf raises, we have two different types of calf raises.
},
{
    228.32,231.12
     One, basically normal calf raises without bending your knees,
},
{
    231.12,233.4
     and the other type that I'm going to show you later on
},
{
    233.4,236.16
     through the program is going to be seated calf raises.
},
{
    236.16,239.36
     Now, I'm going to show you the normal calf raises
},
{
    239.36,241.28
     that we're going to do at home.
},
{
    241.28,243.12
     I have a stool here.
},
{
    243.12,244.88
     It can be anything that you have at home.
},
{
    244.88,245.1
     Again,
},
{
    245.1,250.28
     book, similar stove, kitchen stove, whatever type that you have you can use it.
},
{
    250.28,256.12
     As long as you can actually stand on it and perform the movement. Now, while you're
},
{
    256.12,260.48
     doing the success size, we're trying to keep our knees straight, which means we're
},
{
    260.48,267.16
     not trying to bend on the knees while you're doing the movement. And we're going to do this exercise in three different directions.
},
{
    267.16,270.88
     Straight, toes out, and toes in.
},
{
    270.88,275.76
     I'm going to perform you for set and go to it one by one
},
{
    275.76,277.72
     to give you an idea of how we're going to do this.
},
{
    277.72,279.36
     You're going to stand tall.
},
{
    279.36,284.36
     I'm trying to keep my knees straight and get into the full range of movements
},
{
    284.36,286.0
     while I'm doing this exercise.
},
{
    286.0,289.0
     Which means I'm stretching it all the way down and full range up.
},
{
    289.0,299.0
     Now, to show you from the side, basically I'm trying to get through the full range down.
},
{
    299.0,305.4
     And now for the second set, I'm bringing my toes in and getting the full range down and you can get some
},
{
    305.4,309.48
     balance from the wall. As you can see my knees are straight even when I'm going
},
{
    309.48,314.12
     down I'm getting the full stretch and for the last set I'm bringing my toes out
},
{
    314.12,318.84
     actually and stretching them down and full range up. Slow control down and
},
{
    318.84,323.52
     full range up and trying to have that tempo of the movement. It shouldn't be a
},
{
    323.52,325.68
     fast tempo. We're trying to get
},
{
    325.68,333.04
     through that movement slow and controlled and isolate the muscle correctly. The next exercise
},
{
    333.04,339.76
     is our hip truss. Hip truss is similar exercise to glute bridges, which means I'm going to show
},
{
    339.76,349.24
     the glute bridges initially and then we can progress it to the hip cross which we need some weight with it and usually we use the sit or bench to actually adjust
},
{
    349.24,354.76
     it. Now I'm going to show you the glute bridges exercise that how you can
},
{
    354.76,359.84
     perform it at home and the way that people usually correctly doing it is
},
{
    359.84,372.0
     pretty simple but activating the right muscle is essential. Now you're going to lie on your back, feet should be shoulder apart, same squat, not as wide,
},
{
    372.0,373.0
     pretty much on the floor.
},
{
    373.0,375.0
     You're going to lie on your back.
},
{
    375.0,380.0
     You're going to use your arms as a lever to actually create that movement.
},
{
    380.0,384.0
     And while you're doing this movement, you're trying to relax your neck on the floor,
},
{
    384.0,388.52
     which means your neck is almost going to be on the ground, and your feet are not really far away
},
{
    388.52,389.52
     from your body.
},
{
    389.52,395.0
     It's pretty close to your hip, hands on the floor, and you're trying to push through the
},
{
    395.0,400.32
     hip and the glutes, and isolate the glutes, and obviously your hands.
},
{
    400.32,405.0
     Now while you're doing this exercise, your speed of movement is essential.
},
{
    405.0,409.0
     You don't want to go for a very sharp and fast movement.
},
{
    409.0,412.0
     You want to keep it slow tempo and controlled.
},
{
    412.0,414.0
     I'm going to show you a couple of reps.
},
{
    414.0,417.0
     You're going to hold it there, squeeze the glutes at the top.
},
{
    417.0,418.0
     You've got to feel that.
},
{
    418.0,422.0
     And while you're doing that, you want to go through the full range.
},
{
    422.0,425.4
     Slow control, back up again, hold at the top for
},
{
    425.4,430.2
     a second and one more thing that I wanted to watch out is your knees.
},
{
    430.2,432.76
     You don't want to keep the knees narrow at the end range.
},
{
    432.76,439.04
     You should actually point out to activating more gluteal muscle.
},
{
    439.04,443.96
     Now while you're doing this exercise, if you find that it's easy, there are a couple of
},
{
    443.96,449.88
     ways to actually progress that the first way to increase weights basically you can hold on some
},
{
    449.88,453.88
     weights on your on your foot I'm going to show you something with the ball for
},
{
    453.88,459.48
     example I'm gonna hold the ball and apply the same movement while I'm doing
},
{
    459.48,467.0
     this it does challenge my balance at the same time I'm adding some more weights on that.
},
{
    467.0,472.0
     Which we're going to go through this progression in the following videos.
},
{
    472.0,476.0
     Give it a try this exercise and see how you're getting on.
},
{
    476.0,480.0
     By the end of doing this exercise you need to feel a bit of tension on the glutes
},
{
    480.0,482.0
     and obviously your hamstring.
},
{
    482.0,486.44
     But your hamstring shouldn't be the first muscle group that actually fire while you're doing this.
},
{
    486.44,489.48
     The next exercise that I'm going to show you and coach you
},
{
    489.48,491.48
     would be body weight lunges.
},
{
    491.48,495.04
     It's a brilliant exercise for your hamstring and gluteic muscle group
},
{
    495.04,497.88
     which actually can be sometimes challenging
},
{
    497.88,499.68
     even if you do it without weights.
},
{
    499.68,502.4
     Now, one of the obvious mistakes that I've seen
},
{
    502.4,504.56
     a lot of people do while they're doing lunges.
},
{
    504.56,509.68
     First of all, they have a very narrow base of basically support, which means they keep
},
{
    509.68,514.4
     the food very close to each other and making steps in a very narrow base.
},
{
    514.4,519.88
     Now, initially you want to watch where you stand is your starting position, which means
},
{
    519.88,524.16
     feet shoulder part again and when you're making steps, you don't want to actually narrow that
},
{
    524.16,529.36
     base when you're making steps you don't want to actually narrow that base when you're making that space. As you can see there is a good gap between my two foot from each other.
},
{
    530.16,535.28
     That's the first basic point. The second point that I'm going to show you is how far you're
},
{
    535.28,541.2
     making these steps is essential. If you make short steps that would be very difficult for you to
},
{
    541.2,548.0
     actually maintain your balance and obviously we're trying to get to the full range and longer steps is essential.
},
{
    548.0,554.0
     I'm going to show you from the side, which you can see actually I'm going to make longer steps
},
{
    554.0,557.0
     and push through my heels and back again.
},
{
    557.0,561.0
     From the other side, push through the heels and come back.
},
{
    561.0,563.0
     It's a slow tempo movement again.
},
{
    563.0,569.76
     We're now trying to do it very quick. It should be slow in control, keep the back nice and tall. Now if you look
},
{
    569.76,574.76
     at it from the side, when I'm doing this exercise, I'm avoiding looking at you down.
},
{
    574.76,579.72
     I'm trying to look forward to the front wall and keep my back nice and tall and
},
{
    579.72,585.52
     then change. And that helps me to actually have a better technique and not
},
{
    585.52,590.72
     falling forward than I'm doing it. Like that. You want to keep the core engaged
},
{
    590.72,595.52
     while you're doing it. Now for example if you're adding on weights to it, it can be
},
{
    595.52,599.76
     more challenging because that can consider as an extra resistance and I
},
{
    599.76,607.32
     would suggest to keep it as close to as possible to your body. And the same thing, look forward,
},
{
    607.32,610.42
     keep the back nice and tall, longer steps,
},
{
    610.42,612.26
     and maintain your stairs.
},
{
    612.26,615.94
     Now, last thing that I wanted to mention
},
{
    615.94,619.06
     is how we get through this movement
},
{
    619.06,620.98
     and how we're gonna come back.
},
{
    620.98,624.28
     It's all pushing through your whole foot,
},
{
    624.28,625.92
     most importantly to your heels
},
{
    625.92,632.12
     and coming back. Lean forward, push through the heels and coming back. That is
},
{
    632.12,636.16
     the static lunges that you're going to give it a try in the program without
},
{
    636.16,641.36
     weights and if you feel comfortable always add some weights. The following
},
{
    641.36,645.24
     exercise that I'm going to show you would be side lunges. It's a
},
{
    645.24,650.08
     different variety of lunges. It can be a little more challenging due to the side
},
{
    650.08,654.84
     movement which we don't do it usually but I'm going to show you a simplified
},
{
    654.84,659.5
     exercise and you can give it a try at home and slowly build it up. Now, initial
},
{
    659.5,663.92
     movement I would suggest to start with feet basically double shoulder apart
},
{
    663.92,665.8
     which means you have
},
{
    665.8,671.0
     a wide base of basically support and you try to actually side bend to one side and come
},
{
    671.0,672.0
     back.
},
{
    672.0,677.64
     Now, you try to do this exercise slow tempo, control and you want to go as far as you
},
{
    677.64,678.64
     feel comfortable.
},
{
    678.64,683.08
     It should be a burning feeling, slight, that's fine, but don't go all out.
},
{
    683.08,685.48
     And make sure if you're losing balance,
},
{
    685.48,689.6
     try to maybe use something as simple as that initially
},
{
    689.6,691.2
     to help you to balance yourself
},
{
    692.8,696.14
     and then progress it without that.
},
{
    696.14,699.08
     Now, depends on how many times
},
{
    699.08,700.96
     and how many repetitions that you do,
},
{
    700.96,702.32
     you can actually challenge yourself
},
{
    702.32,705.44
     to maybe initially start to do one side for
},
{
    705.44,710.36
     five, ten, eight, and then change to the other side.
},
{
    710.36,713.88
     Now how can we progress it from there to make it a little more challenging?
},
{
    713.88,715.84
     We'll be creating some sort of movement.
},
{
    715.84,720.08
     I'm going to show you one by one how we're going to do that and give it a try.
},
{
    720.08,725.0
     The initial movement that we're going to do would be that movement.
},
{
    725.0,731.0
     But in more kind of a challenging way, in most of the cases people are struggling with this.
},
{
    731.0,737.0
     What I would suggest to do, try to maintain your foot on the ground and go for shorter.
},
{
    737.0,741.0
     And don't lift your foot off the ground.
},
{
    741.0,743.0
     Try the same thing from the other side.
},
{
    743.0,745.0
     I'll find this side more challenging.
},
{
    745.0,752.0
     I don't go for a full range. Short steps. I still get the muscle works.
},
{
    752.0,759.0
     And then when I got comfortable, I go for a full range and come back a little bit faster speed.
},
{
    759.0,765.04
     Give it a try this exercise and be patient about it and let us know how you're getting on.
},
{
    769.68,770.88
     The following exercise that I'm going to show you, it's a great exercise for our hamstring.
},
{
    775.44,780.24
     This exercise has been designed for the house, which is, you don't need that much equipment, you can use a couch or a seat, I have this guarding couch, I can use it.
},

     And I'm going to show you how to actually try to do these exercises at home.
},
{
    785.0,789.0
     And the technique that you need to watch while you're doing it.
},
{
    789.0,792.0
     Now, I'm going to show you the exercise initially.
},
{
    792.0,797.0
     You're going to lie on your back, your heel will be the contact point with the chair.
},
{
    797.0,803.0
     And what we're trying to do, we're trying to shift the hip off the ground.
},
{
    803.0,808.88
     It is kind of look like glute breaches but the
},
{
    808.88,813.44
     difference is that it has actually a massive kind of amount of tension on your
},
{
    813.44,818.48
     hamstring which is specifically work your hamstring. Obviously your glutes can
},
{
    818.48,823.16
     work as well but not as much as hamstring. Now while you do this exercise you
},
{
    823.16,829.52
     don't necessarily need to go for that high initially. What you could do start from something lower which means
},
{
    829.52,837.16
     I can still use the same stool that I have at home. I can use that or even
},
{
    837.16,849.36
     something slightly lower and try there. Same tempo guys, slow control down. I can feel it. Great tension on my hamstring
},
{
    849.36,855.6
     while I'm doing it. Slow control down and all the way back up. As you can see, I'm pushing
},
{
    855.6,862.08
     two of my heels, both heels are contact point of your basic assit. As soon as you feel comfortable
},
{
    865.04,870.86
     basically a seat. As soon as you feel comfortable that that height is easy for let's say three sets of 10, 12 or 15 then you can add on a higher height of the seat
},

    870.86,None
     or a couch and try it there. It's a great exercise guys. Give it a try and let us know how you're getting on.
