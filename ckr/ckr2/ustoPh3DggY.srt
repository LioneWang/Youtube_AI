     Hey everybody it's Doctor Jo and today I'm going to show you some real time stretches from head to toe.
},
{
    4.56,9.36
     It's a part of my office series but you can do them at home, you can do sitting at a desk,
},
{
    9.36,12.72
     or even if you've been watching TV for a while. So let's get started.
},
{
    13.52,15.44
     Disclaimer alert, disclaimer alert!
},
{
    18.4,19.92
     The Levator scapula stretch.
},
{
    22.32,28.04
     So for the levator scap which is this muscle here, you're going to bring your arm up up
},
{
    28.04,29.44
     the side you want to stretch.
},
{
    29.44,34.32
     Try and get that elbow as high as you comfortably can, and then gently pull your head towards
},
{
    34.32,35.64
     the opposite knee.
},
{
    35.64,41.24
     So you're just going to go down in this direction, and that's stretching this muscle right through
},
{
    41.24,42.24
     here.
},
{
    42.24,45.68
     And the purpose of bringing this side up is to hold that
},
{
    45.68,50.44
     scapula or that shoulder blade down. So it's going to give you a better stretch.
},
{
    50.44,56.38
     If you have a lot of pain there and you feel like that's too much, you don't have
},
{
    56.38,60.16
     to put that arm up. You can still stretch over to the side, but if you can
},
{
    60.16,64.76
     bring it up, it really kind of pushes it down so you can get that good stretch. And
},
{
    64.76,68.28
     if you can't, again, if that feels like it's too much just bring that
},
{
    68.28,73.08
     arm down but maybe try and push it down a little bit or maybe even sit on it if
},
{
    73.08,77.32
     you can that'll give you a little bit more of a stretch there as well but the
},
{
    77.32,81.16
     best way to do it is kind of just resting that hand on the back of the
},
{
    81.16,89.12
     shoulder and then pushing that elbow up as much as you can. But make sure you're getting an angled stretch here so it's not over
},
{
    89.12,95.4
     towards the side, it's not straight down, it's at that angle. And this is really
},
{
    95.4,100.1
     important because that levator scap muscle is the one that elevates our
},
{
    100.1,106.12
     shoulder blades. So when we're sitting at a desk working all day, a lot of times
},
{
    106.12,111.64
     our our shoulders start hunching up and we overwork those muscles and they get
},
{
    111.64,117.04
     really tired and petite. So this is a great stretch just to get it all nice
},
{
    117.04,122.56
     and loosened up and relax everything and start everything kind of over again. And
},
{
    122.56,127.24
     it also the muscle connects down here to
},
{
    127.24,132.56
     your scapula, but it goes all the way up into the neck as well. So sometimes this
},
{
    132.56,137.52
     can cause some shoulder pain, it can cause neck pain, it can cause tension
},
{
    137.52,141.6
     headache sometimes. So again, this is a really important one just to get it all
},
{
    141.6,146.4
     stretched out. So again, bringing that arm and that elbow up,
},
{
    146.4,152.4
     and then just gently pulling down towards the opposite knee. And a lot of times after you're
},
{
    152.4,157.76
     doing it more, you'll feel it just get a little more stretch. You can pull just a little bit more,
},
{
    157.76,162.8
     but you don't ever want that stretch to be painful. You just want to feel some tension in there. So
},
{
    162.8,171.56
     if you're feeling some pain, maybe back off a little bit up here or just go ahead and bring that on down and get that little stretch in there as well.
},
{
    172.76,177.4
     So the rest break in between if you want to kind of shake out the shoulders a little bit you can.
},
{
    177.76,181.68
     If you want to kind of rub these out a little bit you can do that as well.
},
{
    181.76,189.76
     But then just going right back into that stretch and gently pulling over. Make sure you're not pulling your whole body over
},
{
    189.76,193.16
     like that. I've had some people try and do that. You want to keep your back up
},
{
    193.16,198.0
     right and just get that pull at your neck so you're really getting that good
},
{
    198.0,207.0
     stretch right through there. So nice hold, getting that stretch, and then just looking straight down towards that opposite knee.
},
{
    212.52,218.48
     And if you feel like you're getting more of like a pinchy pain versus a stretchy pain,
},
{
    219.12,224.16
     make sure you stop, make sure you talk to your doctor or physical therapist about it,
},
{
    224.24,228.76
     because if you're not getting a stretch with this, if you're just getting pain, you
},
{
    228.76,231.84
     might have something going on where you actually don't need to be
},
{
    231.84,236.4
     stretching this out. But if you don't have any injuries, and again if you're
},
{
    236.4,241.28
     working at your desk all day long, or if you're driving a lot, if you drive a lot
},
{
    241.28,244.4
     of the day, and you're kind of holding on that steering wheel and those shoulders
},
{
    244.4,247.72
     kind of inch up like that, This is a great stretch to kind of
},
{
    247.72,256.32
     work those muscles back out for you. The rhomboid stretch. So the rhomboids are in
},
{
    256.32,259.88
     the back. They kind of hold those shoulder blades together. So you're going to
},
{
    259.88,264.12
     clasp your hands together and you're going to punch forward. Now as you punch
},
{
    264.12,265.6
     forward you're going to tuck your chin in.
},
{
    265.6,268.56
     So really just trying to round out your shoulders.
},
{
    268.56,273.58
     So if you watch a lot of my videos, you know, usually I don't want people to round out their shoulders.
},
{
    273.58,280.18
     But to get that rhomboid stretch, you really just want to punch forward as much as you can and tuck that chin in.
},
{
    280.18,283.28
     So you're getting that nice stretch in your upper back area.
},
{
    284.36,288.64
     So the rhomboids are the ones that squeeze those shoulder blades in.
},
{
    288.64,293.32
     They're right in between and they connect into the spine and on those shoulder blades
},
{
    293.32,294.4
     and squeeze them in.
},
{
    294.4,300.08
     So a lot of times those get really tight and irritated when you're sitting at a desk for
},
{
    300.08,301.52
     a long time.
},
{
    301.52,306.44
     Maybe if you're driving or even if you have to do a lot of lifting things at work.
},
{
    306.44,308.28
     So this is a great stretch to do.
},
{
    308.28,309.68
     You can do it standing up,
},
{
    309.68,311.8
     you don't have to do it sitting down.
},
{
    311.8,313.12
     You can even do it on the floor
},
{
    313.12,315.0
     with your legs straight out in front of you,
},
{
    315.0,318.56
     but really just punching forward and tucking that chin in,
},
{
    318.56,322.16
     and you should feel that stretch in your upper back area.
},
{
    322.16,323.34
     And it feels really good,
},
{
    323.34,328.56
     and it just kinda lets everything be nice and relaxed relaxed. So again just kind of right through there is
},
{
    328.56,333.92
     where you should feel it and just kind of in between just get it nice and
},
{
    333.92,337.68
     relaxed and shake it out a little bit and then go back into the last stretch
},
{
    337.68,342.36
     right here. So again punching forward as far as you come from the can, tucking in,
},
{
    342.36,348.88
     try and keep the lower part of your back straight though so you're not punching forward like that. You're really just curling that top
},
{
    348.88,354.4
     part forward and punching as far as you can, getting that nice good stretch in there.
},
{
    355.52,360.08
     And that stretching should never be painful, it should just feel a little bit of tension
},
{
    360.08,367.28
     kind of stretch in there. Three, two, one. The prayer stretch for your wrist.
},
{
    369.12,374.56
     So with the prayer stretch, this is for things like if you have carpal tunnel syndrome. So put
},
{
    374.56,379.52
     your hands together and bring them down and as you bring them out, bring your elbows out so you're
},
{
    379.52,385.92
     getting a really good stretch right there. So even if you don't have carpal tunnel syndrome, if you are working
},
{
    385.92,392.0
     on a computer a lot or using your hands for a lot of twisting and turning motions, you're probably
},
{
    392.0,396.08
     going to have a lot of tightness in the wrist area. So this is a really good stretch just to kind of
},
{
    396.08,401.92
     loosen everything up in there. So a lot of times if you know that you're starting to get some of
},
{
    401.92,408.24
     those symptoms, it's a tingly numbness kind of feeling in your hands, there's some pain through there, and so again this is a
},
{
    408.24,413.56
     really great stretch. Just see how my elbows go out as I come down. If you
},
{
    413.56,419.14
     already have some symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome, you might get some
},
{
    419.14,423.52
     more tingling when this when you do this stretch, but as long as if you stop it
},
{
    423.52,429.28
     goes away. That's okay because that's just as you're stretching it's putting a little more pressure on the nerve, but like
},
{
    429.28,432.4
     I said, as long as it goes away as soon as you stop then that's fine, but if it seems
},
{
    432.4,436.32
     to last a little bit longer, you probably want to stop and make sure and check with your
},
{
    436.32,440.48
     doctor or your physical therapist because there might be something else going on in there.
},
{
    440.48,447.26
     But it's that median nerve going down and there's usually the culprit that's getting pressed on right through that carpal tunnel there
},
{
    447.26,450.48
     So I have a lot of other stretches for
},
{
    450.92,452.0
     carpal tunnel syndrome
},
{
    452.0,458.0
     But this is a good one to get you started and again if you're working on the computer and you rest those wrists on the
},
{
    458.24,463.36
     Table or on a little pad while you're typing a lot of times that area gets really tight
},
{
    463.36,468.2
     So this one's an easy one to do just to stop and stretch it out really quickly to
},
{
    468.2,473.84
     get everything nice and loosened up. And your co-workers might go, oh that looks
},
{
    473.84,477.92
     interesting maybe we should try it too. So get everybody together and stretch out
},
{
    477.92,485.36
     those wrists. Seated knitted chest stretch. So with the knee to chest stretch,
},
{
    485.36,488.24
     all you're gonna do is just bring your knee up
},
{
    488.24,489.08
     towards your chest.
},
{
    489.08,490.92
     So it's just how it sounds.
},
{
    490.92,494.08
     The key is don't bring your body forward,
},
{
    494.08,496.04
     bring your knee up towards your chest.
},
{
    496.04,498.76
     If you can't bring it as high as mine, that's fine.
},
{
    498.76,500.12
     You know, if you can only bring it to here
},
{
    500.12,501.72
     and you're starting to feel a stretch,
},
{
    501.72,503.24
     that's completely okay.
},
{
    503.24,505.6
     If you have some knee issues,
},
{
    505.6,512.16
     instead of holding it like this, you might want to grab underneath and pull it up. I tell my patients
},
{
    512.16,517.2
     to do that a lot, but if you don't really have any knee issues, sometimes you can get a better pull
},
{
    517.2,521.12
     when you're pulling on the outside versus the inside, but make sure you don't end up irritating
},
{
    521.12,525.6
     your knee by doing this stretch. But when you stretch and you're pulling up,
},
{
    526.24,530.56
     you should feel a little stretch in your bottom area and your low back. That's where you're trying
},
{
    530.56,536.64
     to stretch. Some people feel a little pinching in their groin area, so if you're feeling that little
},
{
    536.64,543.28
     bit of a pinching, either bring your your hip out a little bit with your knee or just don't pull up
},
{
    543.28,548.22
     as high because again you don't want to be pinching something and get it hurting while you're trying to
},
{
    548.22,551.48
     stretch something else out but if you're not feeling that that pinch in there
},
{
    551.48,556.5
     just give it a nice pull and get that stretch as much as you can and then take
},
{
    556.5,560.5
     that little break in between. So make sure that if you're sitting at a desk move
},
{
    560.5,564.54
     out a little bit so you don't bang that knee into the desk but just get that
},
{
    564.54,569.2
     nice little pull. I like having the outside hand up on top and the
},
{
    569.2,572.96
     inside on the bottom I just feel like that's more comfortable for me. Again
},
{
    572.96,576.84
     you can kind of just hold it this way if you want to as long as you don't have
},
{
    576.84,581.76
     any finger issues or knee issues but again if you have some knee pain already
},
{
    581.76,588.72
     just go ahead and grab underneath and pull up and you're you're going to get the same benefit by holding up that stretch this way.
},
{
    588.72,592.2
     But again, don't curl down and stretch like that.
},
{
    592.2,597.52
     Keep your back nice and straight and relaxed because anytime you're stretching something,
},
{
    597.52,599.72
     you really want your whole body to be fairly relaxed.
},
{
    599.72,603.8
     So if you're tensing up other muscles to try and do it, then you're kind of defeating
},
{
    603.8,604.8
     the whole point.
},
{
    604.8,607.72
     So if this is hard and you're having a hard time pulling that
},
{
    607.72,611.64
     knee up, then you can definitely do this lying down which might be a little more
},
{
    611.64,615.16
     comfortable for people. You just might want to wait till you get home to do it
},
{
    615.16,618.96
     and you can check out some of my other videos to be able to do it on the ground
},
{
    618.96,623.8
     at home or even on your bed if you don't want to lie on the ground or if it's too
},
{
    623.8,629.52
     hard to get up you can do it lying on your bed or on the couch as well. So lots of different places to try it, lots of
},
{
    629.52,636.48
     different positions to try it, but just getting that nice stretch in there. And again you should
},
{
    636.48,641.84
     feel it kind of in that low back area, kind of in the bottom area, getting a good stretch in there.
},
{
    647.4,653.04
     getting a good stretch in there. Again, pulling up. Some people ask about the foot. Should it be pulled up? Should it be pointed down? Should it be relaxed? Kind
},
{
    653.04,656.24
     of goes back to the same thing that I was talking about. When you're stretching, I
},
{
    656.24,660.04
     really feel like you should be relaxed. So some people might feel more of a
},
{
    660.04,663.6
     stretch if they're pulling their toes up, but then again you're activating
},
{
    663.6,668.84
     muscles and the point of a stretch is to get those muscles nice and elongated
},
{
    668.84,672.12
     and stretched out. So if you're if you're contracting something sometimes
},
{
    672.12,676.98
     you're defeating that point just a little bit. So again just taking a little
},
{
    676.98,680.92
     rest break in between. Sometimes if you're on a harder chair versus a softer
},
{
    680.92,686.0
     chair it might you know make it a little bit harder or easier depending on what kind of
},
{
    686.0,690.72
     chair surface you're on. But if it's a little bit harder, it might be easier to get the stretch,
},
{
    690.72,695.28
     but you might have a little more pressure on the sit bone. So just make sure you're comfortable
},
{
    695.28,699.52
     again while you're doing it because you don't want to irritate anything down there while you're
},
{
    699.52,706.3
     doing the stretch. And again, if you feel like you're getting a lot of pressure on that
},
{
    706.3,709.84
     knee you can even kind of bring it out a little bit because you're really
},
{
    709.84,714.52
     focusing on pulling this part up. But again if you want to get that knee in
},
{
    714.52,719.68
     there too then you can do that as well. Standing quad stretch. So I'm gonna go
},
{
    719.68,724.76
     ahead and start it and then we'll go along. So with the quad stretch standing
},
{
    724.76,725.48
     you're just
},
{
    725.48,730.36
     going to grab your foot and make sure the top part of your leg is straight down.
},
{
    730.36,735.52
     So the important part of that stretch is that that quad is down. If it's here
},
{
    735.52,739.56
     you're not really going to get a good stretch so you want it there and maybe
},
{
    739.56,744.4
     even back just a little bit. The closer you can get your heel to the bottom, your
},
{
    744.4,747.32
     bottom, the better stretch you're going to get. But you don't have to pull it all
},
{
    747.32,752.76
     the way back. Just pull it until you feel a little stretch in there. And then take
},
{
    752.76,756.82
     that little break in between. But again, if your thigh is coming
},
{
    756.82,760.4
     forward, then you're no longer stretching your quads. So you really want to focus
},
{
    760.4,765.28
     on that. So if you have to hold on a lot to be able to do that, that's fine.
},
{
    771.12,775.2
     Also the most important thing, second to getting that that leg back there, is not to lean forward because see you can be like, well my legs back now, but if you're leaning forward again you're
},
{
    775.2,781.36
     taking away from that stretch. So keep your upper body nice and upright and just pull backwards.
},
{
    781.36,785.84
     Again, you don't have to pull up as high as I do. I stretch every day, so
},
{
    785.84,791.44
     I'm pretty flexible. So if you can only go to there, that's okay. You just go until you feel
},
{
    791.44,798.96
     a comfortable stretch with that. You can also add in a little bit more pushing back to get the hip
},
{
    798.96,809.32
     flexors as well if you want to. So if I'm stretching here and I pull that knee back just a little bit more, I'm gonna get those hip flexors stretching a little bit as well. So if
},
{
    809.32,812.8
     you really want to get kind of a combination stretch, you can do that
},
{
    812.8,817.76
     because that's a great area to stretch out if you're sitting, uh-oh, no falling,
},
{
    817.76,821.16
     if you're sitting a lot throughout the day because those muscles are in a
},
{
    821.16,827.92
     shortened position. So if you pull it back just a little bit, you're going to get a combination stretch, which is really good as well.
},
{
    831.04,835.2
     There's a whole bunch of different ways to stretch out your quad. You can do it lying down,
},
{
    835.2,841.36
     you can do it lying on your side, on your stomach. You can use a strap to stretch it out. But if you're
},
{
    841.92,845.4
     at work and you don't really have equipment this is the
},
{
    845.4,849.76
     best way to stretch it out and it's pretty easy to do especially if you work
},
{
    849.76,854.2
     at a desk and you don't get to move a lot because you can just stand up at your
},
{
    854.2,858.24
     desk you don't have to go anywhere to stretch out and so this is a good way
},
{
    858.24,861.92
     just to keep those muscles moving especially if you don't get to move
},
{
    861.92,867.9
     your legs throughout the day because you don't want to get blood clots or dbt's anything like that and stretching out
},
{
    867.9,873.52
     your legs is a great way to prevent all of that. So again just with the
},
{
    873.52,879.36
     stretching out a little bit getting that break in between and then we've
},
{
    879.36,888.26
     got one more on each side. So with the quad stretch you should feel it right through
},
{
    888.26,893.98
     here. Some people feel it a little bit more in their knee. That could be because
},
{
    893.98,898.38
     maybe that joint is tight as well. So if you're feeling it more in your knee
},
{
    898.38,904.46
     versus in that quad muscle belly area, again maybe you can't go as high but try
},
{
    904.46,908.6
     and bring that leg back just a little bit and that should help get that muscle
},
{
    908.94,915.5
     versus that knee joint because it's all connected and since it's all connected, if it's tight through here,
},
{
    916.14,918.62
     sometimes your knee is going to be very tight as well.
},
{
    920.94,922.94
     So if you feel like
},
{
    923.7,927.44
     your knee is hurting and you're having a lot of pain
},
{
    927.44,931.16
     through there when you're stretching then go ahead and hold off because if
},
{
    931.16,934.52
     you're having pain when you're stretching then there might be something
},
{
    934.52,937.12
     else going on and you should check in with your doctor or your physical
},
{
    937.12,940.72
     therapist because it might not be just tight muscles or might actually be
},
{
    940.72,943.8
     something going on in there and you really want to find out what's going on.
},
{
    943.8,946.9
     So it shouldn't be painful you should just feel tension with
},
{
    946.9,950.7
     the stretch as you're stretching through it.
},
{
    951.14,958.08
     Antirotibialis stretch. So with the anterior tibialis a lot of times if you
},
{
    958.08,961.76
     have shin splints this is the muscle that's irritated. So an easy way to
},
{
    961.76,970.48
     stretch that out is just take your foot behind you and you want your toes, the top of the toes to be flat on the floor. So I'm putting that
},
{
    970.48,975.56
     on the floor to stretch out. Your leg doesn't have to be completely straight. You can bend
},
{
    975.56,981.36
     your knee a little bit, but you want to feel the stretch through right there. So a lot
},
{
    981.36,989.76
     of times when you're stretching, you don't have to push really hard to get that stretch. You can also move your foot around a little bit to
},
{
    989.76,993.36
     stretch the inside and then stretch the outside so you're kind of getting that
},
{
    993.36,998.8
     whole shin area. And I like doing that especially after I do exercises or if I
},
{
    998.8,1003.92
     go for a run. So if I have my foot down like this I can kind of turn it in to
},
{
    1003.92,1007.68
     get that inside of the shin and then I can roll
},
{
    1007.68,1013.92
     my toes to the outside really to get that anterior tip stretch right there. And a lot of times when
},
{
    1013.92,1020.32
     people do this if you get cramping in your feet this might trigger that cramping. So I would say
},
{
    1020.32,1025.68
     if you get a lot of cramping maybe stretch with with your shoes on burrs and see how you feel.
},
{
    1025.68,1029.56
     And if you're starting to get some cramping there, then I wouldn't do it without your shoes on.
},
{
    1029.56,1034.84
     But if you're not getting any cramping, you're probably going to get a little bit better stretch if you take your shoes off.
},
{
    1034.88,1037.54
     So again, just kind of putting your foot back.
},
{
    1038.12,1042.04
     Again, you can bend your knee a little bit, straightening out completely. It's fine.
},
{
    1042.04,1048.28
     You might get a little bit better stretch, but you don't have you can keep it a little bit and again I like to kind of
},
{
    1048.28,1053.84
     halfway through roll it to the outside and then roll it to the inside so you
},
{
    1053.84,1059.28
     can kind of see let me pull up there so you can see I'm pushing out on the big
},
{
    1059.28,1063.88
     toe there and then kind of rolling out to the the pinky toes right there just to
},
{
    1063.88,1070.2
     get that stretch all the way around. Again like I said sometimes if people have a
},
{
    1070.2,1074.56
     tendency to have some cramping that might try and make your foot cramp just
},
{
    1074.56,1081.12
     a little bit. So be be gentle with it at first don't go too crazy with it just as
},
{
    1081.12,1086.0
     a warning so you'll know that that might happen to you. But again a lot
},
{
    1086.0,1090.62
     of times people who walk a lot, people who run, if you're running on surfaces
},
{
    1090.62,1095.36
     that are a little bit harder like concrete or roads with a pavement and
},
{
    1095.36,1101.2
     stuff like that, people do tend to get some shin splints. So this is a really
},
{
    1101.2,1106.72
     good stretch to do, especially if you're exercising after you exercise.
},
{
    1106.72,1110.7
     But a lot of times it's good just to stretch this out if you're sitting at a desk when
},
{
    1110.7,1114.68
     you work all day because you're really not getting these muscles moving very much.
},
{
    1114.68,1119.72
     And it's so important to stretch out these lower muscles because when you're not working
},
{
    1119.72,1124.52
     those muscles throughout the day, then you could be prone to getting blood clots or those
},
{
    1124.52,1128.4
     DVTs which can be very scary. So the more that you're moving around
},
{
    1128.4,1133.44
     and keeping those legs moving, the less likely chance you're going to get a
},
{
    1133.44,1138.24
     blood clot. So you always want to be safe and sorry and any kind of movement is
},
{
    1138.24,1142.2
     going to be really good for that. So this is a good one just to get that whole
},
{
    1142.2,1145.9
     shin area stretched out a little bit.
},
{
    1147.9,1150.08
     So we've got one more on the other side. And again, you can kind of shake those out,
},
{
    1150.08,1152.82
     wiggle those toes a little bit to loosen them up some
},
{
    1152.82,1155.24
     just so they don't try and cramp up on you.
},
{
    1156.84,1160.12
     So again, if you wanna really get that anterior tibialis,
},
{
    1160.12,1162.88
     go roll it out to your pinky toes
},
{
    1162.88,1166.24
     and that's gonna get a nice big stretch. But maybe if you
},
{
    1166.24,1173.2
     have your posterior tibialis a little bit irritated then if you roll over onto your big toe you're
},
{
    1173.2,1178.0
     going to get more of a stretch on the inside there. So I always say just go back and forth and do a
},
{
    1178.0,1183.44
     little bit of both on each side just to get that whole area nice and stretched out and feel pretty
},
{
    1183.44,1185.96
     good about all of it. So there
},
{
    1185.96,1189.36
     you have it those were some real-time stretches which were a part of my office
