{
    0.0,15.04
     Would you like to know what options you have if you're unable to use your inhaler or if
},
{
    15.04,16.4
     your asthma symptoms get worse?
},
{
    16.4,17.4
     Sure.
},
{
    17.4,20.28
     One of the things that you may need to use is a nebulizer.
},
{
    20.28,22.28
     A lot of times the inhaler is much more convenient.
},
{
    22.28,25.94
     The nebulizer will take a little bit longer, but what it does is it delivers the medication
},
{
    25.94,28.4
     over 10 to 15 minutes.
},
{
    28.4,32.64
     And if you're having really severe symptoms, you may not be able to concentrate to do the
},
{
    32.64,36.2
     proper procedure for the inhaler, which we've talked about before.
},
{
    36.2,40.32
     This allows you to get that medication if you're in really, really bad asthma attack.
},
{
    40.32,42.56
     With this, there's two options that you can use.
},
{
    42.56,46.64
     There's a mouthpiece or a mask, which we do for little kids,
},
{
    46.64,49.52
     or if somebody is older and can't hold the mouthpiece.
},
{
    49.52,51.24
     But for most people, the mouthpiece
},
{
    51.24,52.4
     is gonna be the best option,
},
{
    52.4,54.24
     because you're gonna get the medicine down into your lungs
},
{
    54.24,55.68
     instead of into your nose.
},
{
    55.68,57.48
     The mask, if you do have to use a mask,
},
{
    57.48,59.68
     make sure that you do still breathe through your nose,
},
{
    59.68,60.84
     or in through your mouth,
},
{
    60.84,62.92
     to get the medicine down into your lungs.
},
{
    62.92,64.04
     And again, it's beneficial,
},
{
    64.04,65.32
     because if you're really,
},
{
    65.32,67.4
     really tight when you take that inhaler,
},
{
    67.4,69.16
     the first dose of medication is only gonna get
},
{
    69.16,70.6
     to those larger airways.
},
{
    70.6,72.88
     And then if you wait a couple minutes in between,
},
{
    72.88,74.46
     the next dose might not get deep enough.
},
{
    74.46,75.96
     So taking the inhaler over 10,
},
{
    75.96,78.76
     or the nebulizer over 10 minutes will let you get
},
{
    78.76,80.8
     more of the medicine, really open you up,
},
{
    80.8,82.92
     really make you start to feel better.
},
{
    82.92,84.94
     So as far as how to use this,
},
{
    84.94,87.48
     there's a few pieces of equipment that you're gonna need.
},
{
    87.48,88.4
     One of the things you're gonna need
},
{
    88.4,90.2
     is a handheld nebulizer device.
},
{
    90.2,92.86
     They come in all different kinds of varieties.
},
{
    92.86,94.36
     Different companies make them.
},
{
    95.4,97.66
     So they're all gonna have similar parts.
},
{
    97.66,99.24
     They're all gonna have a medicine cup,
},
{
    99.24,101.24
     the mouthpiece or the option for a mask,
},
{
    102.28,103.92
     the nebulizer tubing,
},
{
    103.92,106.24
     which is what you're gonna hook up to the compressor.
},
{
    106.24,112.8
     So the compressor generally plugs into an electrical outlet, but they do make ones that have an adapter
},
{
    112.8,117.28
     that you can use in your car, and some of them also have a battery. So if you're, you know,
},
{
    117.28,121.52
     into camping or going out and do stuff where you might not have the option of plugging it in,
},
{
    121.52,129.8
     the batteries are going to be there for you. This is just a tabletop one, so it just uses the regular outlet. But it's important to
},
{
    129.8,133.2
     remember that if you have one of the devices that has a battery, make sure
},
{
    133.2,135.92
     you check the battery because the last thing you want to worry about when
},
{
    135.92,139.6
     you're out and about is that your battery has died and now you can't get your
},
{
    139.6,144.04
     medicine. So always make sure you double check that. To use the nebulizer, it's
},
{
    144.04,145.38
     very simple.
},
{
    145.38,150.22
     It's going to come in pieces and you just basically assemble it all together.
},
{
    150.22,155.78
     You attach the tubing to the compressor wherever the nozzle is.
},
{
    155.78,161.02
     And then the liquid medications will come in these little foil pouches.
},
{
    161.02,163.38
     Sometimes it will come with five of them in one pouch.
},
{
    163.38,170.24
     And then you can just keep those. And they're typically a pre-measured medication that also has saline in it. If
},
{
    170.24,174.28
     your doctor orders you a different medicine, it may come in a separate bottle, in which
},
{
    174.28,177.88
     case you'd have to put the bottle medicine in and then add saline to it. These are just
},
{
    177.88,182.2
     much more convenient. So it makes it nice and easy for you to use. So once you have all
},
{
    182.2,186.76
     of your equipment ready, the next step will be to put your medication in
},
{
    186.76,189.0
     and these just twist off nice and easy.
},
{
    189.0,190.12
     You squirt it in there.
},
{
    192.88,194.68
     Attach your mouthpiece
},
{
    194.68,196.24
     and then you're gonna turn the device on.
},
{
    196.24,198.36
     And when you turn it on, you're gonna see a mist
},
{
    198.36,200.16
     that starts to come out of the end of the tubing.
},
{
    200.16,201.8
     You also see come out of the mouthpiece.
},
{
    201.8,203.4
     So to take the treatment,
},
{
    203.4,206.0
     what you do is make a nice tight seal on the mouthpiece and just
},
{
    206.0,209.56
     nice slow easy breathing in and out.
},
{
    209.56,213.6
     Every couple breaths, take it a little bit deeper breath and hold it for about three
},
{
    213.6,215.2
     to five seconds.
},
{
    215.2,218.92
     That lets that medicine really deposit that into your lungs so that it can really help
},
{
    218.92,220.8
     you breathe and open you up.
},
{
    220.8,224.56
     If you start to feel dizzy or lightheaded while you're taking this, just slow your breathing
},
{
    224.56,225.0
     down.
},
{
    225.0,230.0
     It's common for people while they're using this device to breathe a little too fast.
},
{
    230.0,233.0
     And when that happens, you'll hyperventilate and it can make you dizzy.
},
{
    233.0,240.0
     But like I said, real simple, you just slow down your breathing and then continue to breathe for the 10 to 15 minutes that it takes to get your treatment.
},
{
    240.0,244.0
     When it's getting towards the end of the medicine, it'll actually start to make a sputtering sound.
},
{
    244.0,248.08
     And in that case, you can just kind of tap the sides of it a little bit to get all that medicine
},
{
    248.08,253.04
     down. Once the mist has stopped appearing, that means that the medication is gone and your treatment
},
{
    253.04,258.48
     is finished. So you would just turn your compressor off. And then if there's any residual liquid
},
{
    258.48,263.36
     medication, then you can just dump it out and then maintain the equipment by just rinsing it
},
{
    263.36,268.52
     and then just letting it air dry. So it's pretty simple. Really important to remember though with this that it has
},
{
    268.52,274.16
     to be kept upright. If you lay down or lean back and tilt this, the medication
},
{
    274.16,277.16
     is not going to hit that part where it needs to actually create a mist. So you
},
{
    277.16,280.36
     always have to make sure that you keep it upright.
