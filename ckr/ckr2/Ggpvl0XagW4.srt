     Hey everybody, it's Doctor Jo and Miss Remy and her pretty pink dress.
},
{
    5.2,9.64
     And today we're going to show you some of my favorite shoulder pain stretches and exercises.
},
{
    9.64,10.64
     So let's get started.
},
{
    10.64,16.12
     Disclaimer alert, disclaimer alert.
},
{
    16.12,19.92
     So before we get started, if you haven't already, make sure and click on the subscribe button

     and make your subscription either public or let me know that you're a subscriber because
},
{
    23.48,27.92
     I always try and respond to my subscribers. So the first stretch slash
},
{
    27.92,31.6
     exercise is going to be pendulums for shoulder pain and these are one of my
},
{
    31.6,35.12
     favorites and when I had shoulder surgery this really helped loosen
},
{
    35.12,39.36
     everything up and made it feel a lot better. So with the shoulder pendulums
},
{
    39.36,42.4
     it's kind of like it sounds you're making your arm like a pendulum
},
{
    42.4,45.12
     but you really want it to be as passive as it
},
{
    45.12,50.08
     possibly can if you have a lot of shoulder pain. If you're not on any precautions or if you're not
},
{
    50.08,54.32
     on post-op surgery where you have things that you're not allowed to do you can actively move it a
},
{
    54.32,59.76
     little bit but I find that if you really just let your arm hang down and relax and move it with your
},
{
    59.76,65.04
     body that makes it feel a lot better because just the arm hanging down really opens
},
{
    65.04,69.4
     up that joint and it makes it just feel so much better. So with this one you're
},
{
    69.4,72.6
     just gonna make some circles. So you can see I'm probably activating it a little
},
{
    72.6,75.88
     bit. It's really hard to make something completely passive when you're away, but
},
{
    75.88,80.24
     really using the body to make most of that movement. So you can do maybe like 10
},
{
    80.24,84.96
     one way and then reverse it and go back the other way just to get it nice and
},
{
    84.96,86.16
     loosened up.
},
{
    86.16,90.8
     You can also do a front to back motion where you're just kind of rocking your body and that
},
{
    90.8,97.36
     shoulder is following along with it and then you can even do like a side to side. So again this is
},
{
    97.36,102.08
     really nice you don't necessarily have to do for reps if you want to just do 30 seconds worth of
},
{
    102.08,108.4
     beach and build your time up to one minute doing it it a couple times a day, you can do that. That makes it feel really, really good.
},
{
    108.4,113.64
     The next one would be table slides for your shoulder. I'm just going to do
},
{
    113.64,117.44
     demonstrated on the chair so we don't actually have to go to a table or move
},
{
    117.44,121.4
     anything differently. But you want a flat surface, you want it to be pretty smooth.
},
{
    121.4,126.64
     If you need something like a towel to help it slide, you can.
},
{
    126.64,130.2
     But most of the time, you can just kind of move it very nicely
},
{
    130.2,132.92
     on like a tabletop or again, like a chair or something.
},
{
    132.92,134.48
     But if you have any issues, you probably
},
{
    134.48,135.68
     don't want to sit like this.
},
{
    135.68,137.48
     But you can do a countertop too, because then you
},
{
    137.48,139.72
     can stand up and do it a little bit easier.
},
{
    139.72,142.44
     When you put your arm out in front of you on the counter
},
{
    142.44,147.14
     or the chair or the table, put your thumb in an upward position.
},
{
    147.14,149.14
     This helps open up that shoulder joint.
},
{
    149.14,153.62
     If you go this way, it'll put it in a little bit more of an impinged position and it might
},
{
    153.62,155.0
     be more uncomfortable.
},
{
    155.0,157.6
     So I like having people start off this way.
},
{
    157.6,162.28
     And all you're going to do is you're using the support of whatever it's on and you're
},
{
    162.28,164.08
     just sliding forward.
},
{
    164.08,165.08
     So see, as I slide forward, it's on and you're just sliding forward. So see as I slide
},
{
    165.08,170.32
     forward it's stretching out that shoulder. So I'm getting that stretch but I'm
},
{
    170.32,174.46
     having something supported so it's not that I'm actively doing it. I'm actively
},
{
    174.46,179.66
     assisting doing it and so just going as far as you comfortably can and coming
},
{
    179.66,183.88
     back up. Again you can just start off with five or ten. You can also go in
},
{
    183.88,189.28
     different directions so if you wanted to do like a scaption motion, which would be almost like that 45 degree
},
{
    189.28,198.08
     angle, you can slide it this way. You could even turn completely to the side and do like an abduction
},
{
    198.08,204.32
     motion, sliding it out. But just go till you feel some tension. Don't go till you feel pain. And if
},
{
    204.32,205.76
     you want to hold it there, once you get that tension for Don't go till you feel pain. And if you wanna hold it there,
},
{
    205.76,207.82
     once you get that tension for two or three seconds,
},
{
    207.82,210.32
     really just to get that stretch in there, you can.
},
{
    210.32,213.32
     So you can kind of just continuously go back and forth,
},
{
    213.32,215.72
     or you can hold a little bit and get a nice stretch in there.
},
{
    215.72,218.8
     So again, maybe just starting off with five to 10
},
{
    218.8,221.4
     in each direction, doing that a couple of times
},
{
    221.4,222.42
     throughout the day.
},
{
    222.42,224.04
     So next I'm gonna sit in the chair
},
{
    224.04,227.04
     and I'm gonna do some resistive band work.
},
{
    227.04,228.76
     So when you use resistive bands,
},
{
    228.76,230.4
     start off with the lightest band.
},
{
    230.4,233.88
     And it also depends on what branded is
},
{
    233.88,235.24
     of the color of resistance.
},
{
    235.24,237.36
     So this one is just the next step up.
},
{
    237.36,240.16
     But if you haven't used resistive bands
},
{
    240.16,242.16
     before, I would start with the lightest one.
},
{
    242.16,243.6
     So the next exercise is gonna be
},
{
    243.6,250.72
     an external rotation of the shoulders. So keep your elbows by your side, put your thumbs up on top. You don't
},
{
    250.72,254.64
     have to bring them up, but that's the position. You don't want to be this way. You want to be up
},
{
    254.64,258.96
     this way. And try and keep your wrist locked out in a neutral position. Sometimes when people do
},
{
    258.96,262.8
     this exercise, they want to pull like this. We don't want to get your shoulder better and then
},
{
    262.8,266.0
     having your wrist start hurting. So try and keep those in a neutral position.
},
{
    266.0,267.28
     And I'm going to take a second here
},
{
    267.28,269.64
     just to do my smile for my thumbnail.
},
{
    270.94,273.4
     So you can take that picture too if you want to.
},
{
    273.4,275.76
     Keep your elbows by your side the whole time
},
{
    275.76,278.72
     and then just gently pull out.
},
{
    278.72,281.8
     Really try and control the band coming back in
},
{
    281.8,283.4
     and really keep your elbows by your side.
},
{
    283.4,284.48
     Sometimes people want to do this.
},
{
    284.48,289.12
     I see a lot of my patients try and do this, but that's changing the exercise. That's not quite
},
{
    289.12,293.68
     getting external rotation anymore. So keep those elbows by your side, keep those wrists in that neutral
},
{
    293.68,301.52
     position and really just control that band. So it's not fast, it's nice and smooth, especially
},
{
    301.52,305.44
     the coming back in motion. So when you're using resistive bands,
},
{
    305.44,307.08
     if you haven't used them before,
},
{
    307.08,310.64
     again, I'd start off with low reps, five to 10,
},
{
    310.64,314.72
     10 to 15, but just do a couple sets
},
{
    314.72,316.76
     and then a couple times throughout the day.
},
{
    316.76,319.08
     But I'd rather you do less and then build it up
},
{
    319.08,322.36
     so you don't get super sore while you're doing that.
},
{
    322.36,326.32
     So then the next one is gonna be shoulder rows. You can do rows
},
{
    326.32,330.96
     in every single position. You can do it on the floor with your feet out or on your bed with
},
{
    330.96,334.96
     your feet out. You can do it standing with the band kind of wrapped around something,
},
{
    334.96,340.64
     but I like to do it just sitting in a chair and wrapping the band around my feet. So then you're
},
{
    340.64,345.56
     in a comfortable position and then you've got a nice angle of the band,
},
{
    345.56,349.0
     but you can wrap it around your feet and not have to have something that you need to wrap
},
{
    349.0,350.0
     it around.
},
{
    350.0,352.0
     So it's kind of, it just makes it really easy to do.
},
{
    352.0,355.2
     Same kind of concept where you want your wrist to be in a neutral position.
},
{
    355.2,359.52
     You want those thumbs to be in an upward position and you want your elbows to be pretty close
},
{
    359.52,360.52
     to your side.
},
{
    360.52,362.88
     So it's not coming out like this.
},
{
    362.88,368.04
     It's really pulling in and squeezing your shoulder blades back while you do it.
},
{
    368.32,371.48
     If you want to change the angle, if this feels too hard, you can bring your
},
{
    371.48,374.2
     feet up a little bit and then get that different angle.
},
{
    374.36,376.32
     But try and keep your shoulders down.
},
{
    376.32,378.32
     So it's not coming up like this.
},
{
    378.32,383.76
     It's really getting that motion in the shoulders, going back and squeezing those
},
{
    383.76,385.52
     shoulder blades together while you're
},
{
    385.52,392.96
     doing it. Same thing, try and control the band, really get that smooth motion, especially
},
{
    392.96,398.56
     the coming back position with that. Just starting off with five to ten, one or two sets, a couple
},
{
    398.56,404.96
     times a day. So the last one is going to be what we call a serratus punch, and that's those
},
{
    404.96,406.0
     anterior serratus
},
{
    406.0,410.8
     muscles and those are the ones that really kind of help stabilize that shoulder blade. The shoulder
},
{
    410.8,416.08
     blade has over 20 muscles connected to it so if there's something wrong, if it's not moving how
},
{
    416.08,422.16
     it's supposed to, it can make the whole shoulder complex painful. So serratus punches are sometimes
},
{
    422.16,430.4
     another one that people have a little bit of a hard time with. So I'm going to start out just straight out in front of me, but to get the best exercise for it,
},
{
    430.4,436.32
     you really want to come up to about maybe a hundred, fifteen, a hundred and twenty degree angle and do the motion,
},
{
    436.32,442.08
     but it's easier, I think, to start off with that 90 degrees to get the concept of the punch.
},
{
    442.08,446.0
     So with a serratus punch, you're not bending your elbows at all.
},
{
    446.0,451.04
     You're not punching your arms forward. People tend to want to punch like this, but to get those muscles
},
{
    451.04,458.72
     working, you're keeping those elbows straight and you're moving your whole shoulder complex forward
},
{
    458.72,464.56
     and then backward. So see the movement's coming from here. It's not coming from my elbow. So going
},
{
    464.56,468.6
     forward almost like I'm trying to reach and grab something and then bringing
},
{
    468.6,471.36
     everything back in almost where I'm squeezing those shoulder blades together
},
{
    471.36,478.68
     again. So again not punching but really just pushing forward and coming back in.
},
{
    478.68,483.24
     So once you get it in that plane pretty comfortably then bring it up just a
},
{
    483.24,485.28
     little bit and then you're punching up
},
{
    485.92,490.72
     and coming back in. So you're getting that serratus punch and then once you get that
},
{
    490.72,494.88
     mastered then you can add a resistive band to it. So I've got that in some of my other videos if
},
{
    494.88,498.72
     you want to check those out. So there you have it those were some of my favorite shoulder pain
},
{
    498.72,502.24
     stretches and exercises. If you'd like to help support my channel make sure and click on the
