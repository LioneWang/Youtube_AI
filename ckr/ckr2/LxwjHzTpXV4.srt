     Hey guys, welcome to another video from Skinny Medic.
},
{
    18.76,22.84
     Some of my other videos I've talked about how to do tourniquets and how to apply tourniquets.
},
{
    22.84,31.04
     We'll have a brand new product I want to show you guys. This product is called the Cat Tourniquet. It is designed for the military. So instead
},
{
    31.04,36.32
     of having to tie triangle bandage and tie knot around it and twist it, this is all one
},
{
    36.32,41.84
     package, neatly packaged. It's a very neat product. Guys, this is the Cat Tourniquet
},
{
    41.84,48.8
     here a little closer up for you. It has the band that goes around the extremity with it being an arm and a leg.
},
{
    48.8,51.32
     And it has your tightening device already right here.
},
{
    51.32,58.92
     This is a composite stick that's round with a ribbon that goes throughout the entire strap
},
{
    58.92,60.84
     so prevent from pinching.
},
{
    60.84,62.44
     And this is your tourniquet here in one package.
},
{
    62.44,68.56
     So you're not trying to find a band or not trying to find some cloth and a knife or something to apply the
},
{
    68.56,73.44
     tourniquet. It's all here in one neat little package. For this portion of the
},
{
    73.44,77.4
     video we're gonna say that I have a some profuse bleeding right here coming from
},
{
    77.4,87.0
     the crease of my elbow. So you would just take the tourniquet, slide it on here and then this tightens down.
},
{
    87.0,95.4
     Then from my little elbow, strap this around just like that.
},
{
    95.4,99.16
     Okay, so now we've got this tight.
},
{
    99.16,107.46
     This rotates and spins around and you would keep spinning this knob here until your bleeding cuts off.
},
{
    107.46,111.9
     See if you can see it.
},
{
    111.9,115.94
     Then once you get the bleeding stop this locks into place
},
{
    115.94,119.5
     just like that. Then
},
{
    119.5,123.1
     bring this back around and there you go.
},
{
    123.1,126.32
     It is in place. So you can apply this to yourself
},
{
    126.96,131.44
     to control bleeding if something were to happen. Instead of having to tie an overhand knot and
},
{
    131.44,137.36
     turn it and try to tie it again, this is much simpler, much easier. Same thing here if you
},
{
    137.36,142.16
     had some profuse bleeding coming from your leg. Get it as close as you can to the side,
},
{
    142.16,146.88
     but you want this to be on the side closest to the heart. Same thing, get this as tight as you can to the side but you want this to be on the side closest to the heart.
},
{
    153.6,154.48
     Same thing, get this as tight as you can, wrap it around and then this just rotates.
},
{
    161.12,162.0
     Rotate this until bleeding stops okay. It locks into place right there with this plastic.
},
{
    164.48,166.32
     Strap that down. You can also note the time down if you'd wish.
},
{
    166.32,172.4
     So this should stop all major bleeding. This is the cat tourniquet guys. Like I said, it's
},
{
    172.4,176.92
     currently being used by our military out in the field and they are having great results
},
{
    176.92,184.28
     with it. It has a 0% failure rate, okay? So it means 100% of the time this device is working
},
{
    184.28,186.32
     and without any malfunctions.
},
{
    186.32,187.32
     It's great.
},
{
    187.32,189.88
     You can put it in your backpack, keep it in your survival kit.
},
{
    189.88,192.52
     It's a great item to have.
},
{
    192.52,193.88
     Once again, thank you for watching.
},
{
    193.88,195.32
     I hope this video helps you.
