     What's up guys? Hey, Jared Bechstra here, doctor of physical therapy, tonentine.com.
},
{
    4.56,8.84
     In this video, I want to share with you two of my favorite neck exercises that can alleviate
},
{
    8.84,11.84
     your neck pain about as fast as this intro.
},
{
    21.84,27.2
     Pretty quick, am I right? Honestly though, the exercises that I'm about to show you, I have given to patients in the
},
{
    27.2,30.64
     past and they do offer some pretty immediate results.
},
{
    30.64,33.64
     However, it has to be for the right kind of neck pain.
},
{
    33.64,37.12
     I tell people all the time, not all neck pain is created equally.
},
{
    37.12,41.68
     And depending on what's causing your pain, we need to treat that just a little bit differently.
},
{
    41.68,52.08
     So for the purposes of this video, if you're having joint related neck pain, arthritis, limited range of motion, if your joint is stuck, if you can only get so far,
},
{
    52.08,56.64
     maybe in your rotation or your extension, and you feel a significant amount of pain or a mechanical
},
{
    56.64,63.52
     block at that point, these exercises can be highly effective for you. As always, if you do have any
},
{
    63.52,65.14
     ridiculous pain or symptoms, meaning if do have any ridiculous pain or symptoms,
},
{
    65.14,66.34
     meaning if you have any numbness
},
{
    66.34,68.9
     or tingling going on in your arm or shoulder,
},
{
    68.9,70.34
     please go get that checked out.
},
{
    70.34,73.54
     That's not something that we wanna mess around with at all.
},
{
    73.54,77.1
     That's not something that we can maybe treat here on YouTube.
},
{
    77.1,79.1
     That's something that you best be served
},
{
    79.1,81.46
     by consulting with a local professional
},
{
    81.46,82.98
     to get exercises that are right
},
{
    82.98,85.1
     for your specific condition.
},
{
    85.1,86.9
     Now that being said, you guys know me,
},
{
    86.9,89.06
     let's jump into the anatomy lesson
},
{
    89.06,92.2
     to give you a little rundown of why these exercises
},
{
    92.2,94.32
     are going to be effective for you.
},
{
    94.32,97.82
     So here's my spine model and let's get a zoom in here
},
{
    97.82,98.68
     on the neck.
},
{
    98.68,101.68
     Right now I turned it around and so they're actually facing
},
{
    101.68,104.04
     this the skeletons actually facing away from you,
},
{
    104.04,106.8
     zoom in here tight. Now you'll can see you can see
},
{
    106.96,113.6
     If I rotate that skeletons head to the right that motion occurs at the top vertebrae first
},
{
    113.6,118.56
     And then the rotation occurs on this top down kind of segmented motion
},
{
    118.56,122.6
     The majority of your rotation range of motion is going to come from this upper vertebrae
},
{
    122.6,129.68
     And so keep that in mind the other thing that I want to show you with this is as I rotate his neck to the right or as I
},
{
    129.68,135.2
     rotate his head to the right, which way do those vertebrae move? Now the spinous process, that's
},
{
    135.2,140.72
     this big bony part right here, actually moves to the left. So right rotation, those vertebrae,
},
{
    140.72,149.92
     you can see them moving this direction to the left. And so those are the two things that I want you to keep in mind that motion usually occurs from the top and comes down.
},
{
    149.92,155.52
     And that whenever we rotate, it's those spinous processes going in the other direction. That
},
{
    155.52,160.88
     becomes important because depending on how far you can move your head, if it's only very little,
},
{
    160.88,164.88
     we know that that problem is a little higher up. However, if you can move a little further until
},
{
    164.88,166.88
     you get to that pain point, we know that that pain is a little higher up. However, if you can move a little further until you get to that pain point, we know
},
{
    166.88,169.16
     that that pain is a little bit further down.
},
{
    169.16,174.24
     So now what I want to do is show you a couple of simple stretches, but we're going to preface
},
{
    174.24,177.2
     those with a couple of simple joint mobilizations.
},
{
    177.2,178.64
     I want to mobilize the joint.
},
{
    178.64,183.44
     I want to get it moving the way that it normally should before we stretch.
},
{
    183.44,186.52
     If we can mobilize that joint out of the pain
},
{
    186.52,188.48
     to make the stretching more effective,
},
{
    188.48,189.92
     it's gonna be a lot better for you.
},
{
    189.92,192.46
     So let's show you these two exercises right now.
},
{
    193.62,195.0
     For both of these exercises,
},
{
    195.0,197.34
     all that you're going to need is a pillowcase
},
{
    197.34,200.44
     or even a hand towel that's approximately this size.
},
{
    200.44,203.22
     What I want you to do is grab opposite corners.
},
{
    203.22,209.68
     That's gonna make that pillowcase as long as possible and then just put that over your neck or over your head and behind your neck
},
{
    209.76,212.12
     Now I mentioned in the introduction here that
},
{
    212.52,219.02
     Depending on where that sticky point is or where that pain point happens. It's either going to be higher or lower in your neck
},
{
    219.02,221.02
     It's important that with this pillowcase
},
{
    221.44,228.78
     We isolate that point and so I either want the pillowcase up nice and high on my head or depending on where that pain point is
},
{
    228.78,233.1
     I can move it down on my neck. The first thing I want to show you is a
},
{
    233.1,239.5
     mobilization in a rotation motion to your neck. And so for example pillowcases
},
{
    239.5,243.0
     around my neck if I can only rotate my head let's say I'm gonna rotate my head
},
{
    243.0,247.72
     to the left and let's say I can only go that far before that pain starts to happen.
},
{
    247.72,251.88
     What I want to do is I want to get this towel right on that spinous process.
},
{
    251.88,257.84
     So right on that, that bony point on the back of my neck and then help it to rotate further.
},
{
    257.84,259.68
     I'm rotating to the left.
},
{
    259.68,262.0
     That vertebrae needs to rotate to the right.
},
{
    262.0,269.36
     To do that, I'm going to keep this left hand down with my right hand. I'm on that spinous process on the back, on the back of my neck. As I rotate
},
{
    269.36,274.64
     here, I'm just going to push a little further with my hand. And what that's doing is moving
},
{
    274.64,278.88
     that spinous process just a little further. It doesn't need to be a big motion. Just needs
},
{
    278.88,284.64
     to be a slight motion. And I'm going to do about five or so of those pulses. What you should find
},
{
    284.64,286.12
     is you'll be able to rotate your neck
},
{
    286.12,289.24
     a little further before that pain point hits,
},
{
    289.24,290.84
     and then you're going to repeat that again,
},
{
    290.84,293.3
     about five of those little pulses,
},
{
    293.3,296.28
     just trying to get that vertebrae mobilized,
},
{
    296.28,298.84
     just trying to get that joint used to moving
},
{
    298.84,300.48
     without pain again.
},
{
    300.48,302.72
     As soon as we do about three sets of that,
},
{
    302.72,305.88
     so I would even do that one more time into that end range.
},
{
    305.88,308.4
     And as soon as we can get a little bit further
},
{
    308.4,310.88
     without that pain response happening,
},
{
    310.88,313.84
     now let's take it into a stretch for your neck.
},
{
    313.84,316.5
     To do that, you're going to let go of the pillowcase,
},
{
    316.5,317.92
     you're going to cross your arms,
},
{
    317.92,320.28
     and then you're going to grab the pillowcase again.
},
{
    320.28,321.36
     With my right hand,
},
{
    321.36,323.36
     I'm gonna keep that right against my chest.
},
{
    323.36,331.2
     Now I'm gonna use my left hand to pull kind of across my cheekbone in this rotation motion. As I pull my left hand kind of
},
{
    331.2,337.52
     away and behind my body, you're going to feel a great stretch right in the back, right in the neck,
},
{
    337.52,342.96
     in that area where you just mobilized. What I tell people is to hold that for about a 20 second count
},
{
    342.96,346.86
     and then release it and then you you're gonna repeat that three times.
},
{
    346.86,349.98
     And so that is your rotation mobilization
},
{
    349.98,353.14
     and stretch series that I'd like you to go through.
},
{
    353.14,355.44
     You can repeat this series three, four,
},
{
    355.44,357.6
     and even up to five times a day.
},
{
    358.98,360.48
     So we talked about rotation.
},
{
    360.48,362.48
     That's probably the primary limitation
},
{
    362.48,364.22
     that I typically see with neck pain.
},
{
    364.22,368.68
     The second one that most people complain about is extension, meaning the ability to look
},
{
    368.68,369.68
     up.
},
{
    369.68,372.08
     I look up and it's pain, it's sharp, it's stabbing.
},
{
    372.08,374.72
     I can't look up without pain in my neck.
},
{
    374.72,377.6
     Those are the types of reports that I get from patients.
},
{
    377.6,381.24
     Those are the types of things that I want to show you how to work your way out of right
},
{
    381.24,382.24
     now.
},
{
    382.24,383.84
     We're going to grab our pillow case again.
},
{
    383.84,388.24
     The other thing that I've changed up is I've got a chair here and you'll notice that it's a sturdy chair.
},
{
    388.24,393.76
     I don't want it to pivot or swivel or anything. And then it's also got a relatively low back on it.
},
{
    393.76,398.64
     I don't want it to be super high up on my shoulder blades because I'm going to want to be able to
},
{
    398.64,405.4
     extend back over it. Still got my pillowcase. It's still folded at the corners and I'm going to go
},
{
    405.4,412.56
     up right over my neck again. So same test applies here as I extend back. If I'm stuck
},
{
    412.56,418.04
     about right there, what I want to do is get that pillowcase up right on that level where
},
{
    418.04,423.84
     it tends to be sticky. Now the first thing that we want to do is just perform some gentle
},
{
    423.84,425.06
     kind of active range of
},
{
    425.06,427.06
     motion type exercises.
},
{
    427.06,430.56
     You're going to get that right up on that vertebrae and you're going to just hold it
},
{
    430.56,431.56
     right there.
},
{
    431.56,434.14
     So we're right here and then all you need to do is push.
},
{
    434.14,439.62
     I'm pushing this way with the towel, just a gentle pressure as I try to look up.
},
{
    439.62,440.86
     So it looks just like that.
},
{
    440.86,444.74
     All you're going to do is look up, hold two, three and down.
},
{
    444.74,449.84
     Up and hold two, three, and down. And what you should find is that as you continue to
},
{
    449.84,454.48
     perform this motion about five or so times, you should be able to look up a
},
{
    454.48,460.28
     little higher each time that you go up. Now as you get higher and higher, we want
},
{
    460.28,464.32
     to continue to mobilize that neck and promote that extension. We're going to do
},
{
    464.32,467.0
     that through the neck as well as through the upper back with the
},
{
    467.0,470.6
     chair. So I'm right here. I'm right on my spot.
},
{
    470.68,474.32
     I'm going to come up to where I kind of meet that pain point.
},
{
    474.44,478.36
     But now what I can do is with my hands, lift my hands up.
},
{
    478.4,480.12
     So about the level of my eyes,
},
{
    480.12,482.72
     my eyes are about looking at my hands right here.
},
{
    482.72,485.04
     I'm going to come up and then I'm going to lift
},
{
    485.04,491.2
     just like this to extend further into that extension motion because you can apply that traction
},
{
    491.2,496.8
     force and that lifting force. Oftentimes that's enough to eliminate that pain response and help
},
{
    496.8,501.76
     you into that further range of motion. You can then take this even one step further and extend
},
{
    501.76,506.26
     back over the chair. Really helps your thoracic spine and your posture
},
{
    506.26,508.0
     to get to where they need to be.
},
{
    508.0,510.12
     And so that whole thing will look just like this.
},
{
    510.12,513.04
     We're right here, I'm gonna extend back with my neck,
},
{
    513.04,515.12
     I'm gonna extend up with my hands,
},
{
    515.12,517.88
     and then I'm going to extend back and over the chair
},
{
    517.88,520.4
     just until a comfortable stretch is felt,
},
{
    520.4,522.32
     and then hold that for about five seconds
},
{
    522.32,524.0
     and then come back down out of it.
},
{
    524.0,529.68
     So we're gonna come up, hold here, extend back, lift over the chair, hold one,
},
{
    529.68,535.08
     two, three, four, five, and it looks just like that. I typically recommend that you
},
{
    535.08,539.56
     perform that one about ten times and then like the other exercise that I
},
{
    539.56,543.52
     showed you, you can perform that three to five times throughout your day. As
},
{
    543.52,548.0
     always, if any of these increase your your pain that's an indication they're going the wrong
},
{
    548.0,551.7
     direction. I want you to cut them out immediately and again it's a good idea to
},
{
    551.7,555.72
     go get it checked out by a local physical therapist or a local professional. So I
},
{
    555.72,559.12
     hope those help you guys out. I hope that helps you out of some of the neck pain
},
{
    559.12,562.52
     or discomfort that you might be experiencing. If it does do me a favor
