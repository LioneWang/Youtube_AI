},

    69.12,72.04
     Yeah, fit index, vibrating massage ball.
},
{
    72.04,73.16
     I haven't had problems with that.
},
{
    73.16,74.12
     That's a nice one.
},
{
    74.12,75.56
     Yeah, this got three settings.
},
{
    75.56,76.92
     Well, it's four settings actually.
},
{
    76.92,79.28
     The fifth, the fourth setting is actually intermittent.
},
{
    79.28,80.12
     Yeah, intervals.
},
{
    80.12,83.24
     But this baby works like a little vibrating fold roll.
},
{
    83.24,84.8
     It's a little bit of bounce roll a little bit.
},
{
    84.8,87.08
     Oh yeah, down here, this way, you can see it.
},
{
    87.08,87.92
     Whoa!
},
{
    87.92,88.76
     Look at that baby.
},
{
    88.76,89.84
     Hop to it.
},
{
    89.84,90.68
     All right Brad,
},
{
    90.68,91.52
     let's go on.
},
{
    91.52,92.36
     We go here for other things.
},
{
    92.36,96.12
     Sciatic leg pain, the pain that starts typically
},
{
    96.12,98.16
     in the back runs down the leg,
},
{
    98.16,100.92
     oftentimes in the back, the leg sometimes in the front,
},
{
    100.92,104.14
     and all the way to the foot or even to the toes.
},
{
    104.14,105.72
     That's what we're looking at here.
},
{
    105.72,108.08
     The vast majority of time it's caused
},
{
    108.08,110.84
     from a low back disc problem.
},
{
    110.84,112.64
     Like a herniated disc, bulging disc.
},
{
    112.64,113.6
     Exactly.
},
{
    113.6,115.9
     So that's what I'm gonna show you a system
},
{
    115.9,117.24
     that's gonna start you out.
},
{
    117.24,120.36
     Seven steps, when you get to the seventh step,
},
{
    120.36,121.84
     things are doing quite well.
},
{
    121.84,122.84
     So let's get going.
},
{
    122.84,123.68
     All right.
},
{
    123.68,124.52
     You're rare.
},
{
    125.28,127.36
     I'm ready Bob. No, there. I'm ready, Bob.
},
{
    127.36,128.56
     No, I don't need that, yeah.
},
{
    128.56,129.68
     Okay.
},
{
    129.68,130.96
     I'm just getting a little nervous now.
},
{
    130.96,132.44
     You know, those stage fright.
},
{
    132.44,134.92
     All right, so the first thing you're gonna do is,
},
{
    134.92,137.72
     I'm sorry, is we're going to,
},
{
    137.72,140.72
     you can do this on the floor's preferable carpeted floor.
},
{
    140.72,143.84
     If you have a firm bed, I'm gonna do it here.
},
{
    143.84,144.72
     That will be fine.
},
{
    144.72,149.32
     We're gonna be on our back.
},
{
    149.32,151.36
     I'm sorry, I'm so confused.
},
{
    151.36,153.48
     On our back, hook line position.
},
{
    153.48,154.4
     All right, gotcha.
},
{
    154.4,156.34
     Single knee, now both knees are up.
},
{
    156.34,158.8
     We're gonna take the single one knee,
},
{
    158.8,161.0
     bring it up and do a stretch.
},
{
    161.0,162.88
     And you're gonna continue this as long as
},
{
    162.88,166.16
     nothing is worsened or increased pain. If it makes it worse, you're not doing this a stretch. And you're gonna continue this as long as nothing is worsened or increased pain.
},
{
    166.16,167.0
     If it makes it worse,
},
{
    167.0,169.0
     you're not doing this particular stretch.
},
{
    169.0,171.24
     Particularly anything down the leg.
},
{
    171.24,174.08
     If it feels worse below the knee and the foot,
},
{
    174.08,176.6
     definitely right away you'll stop.
},
{
    176.6,179.18
     This more than likely will not do it.
},
{
    179.18,180.52
     That's why I'm having you do it.
},
{
    180.52,182.28
     And you can go up and then bring the knee
},
{
    182.28,184.48
     across the chest slightly
},
{
    184.48,185.04
     so we get that
},
{
    185.04,187.18
     piriformis muscle stretched.
},
{
    187.18,188.02
     And we're just gonna-
},
{
    188.02,190.68
     So is the idea Brad, that if it's the piriformis
},
{
    190.68,192.76
     it's gonna help, and if it's not the piriformis
},
{
    192.76,193.9
     it's not gonna help?
},
{
    193.9,194.74
     Or we're thinking-
},
{
    194.74,196.14
     Right, we're just, we're eliminating
},
{
    196.14,199.02
     one more potential source for that sciatica.
},
{
    199.02,201.62
     So this is kind of a test stretch.
},
{
    201.62,203.9
     And if this stretch makes it worse,
},
{
    203.9,205.36
     you're not gonna do it. If it makes it worse, you're not gonna do it.
},
{
    205.36,207.04
     If it makes it better,
},
{
    207.04,210.56
     you're gonna go ahead and proceed and continue to do it.
},
{
    210.56,211.4
     Exactly.
},
{
    211.4,212.8
     Do it just like I'm doing
},
{
    212.8,215.4
     five to 10 repetitions on a side.
},
{
    215.4,216.24
     Okay.
},
{
    216.24,218.16
     And now this next exercise,
},
{
    219.82,220.8
     it's kind of optional,
},
{
    220.8,222.0
     but I like to throw it in there
},
{
    222.0,224.74
     because it can help relax the back muscles
},
{
    224.74,226.98
     around where the disc is.
},
{
    226.98,229.62
     And we're just gonna do some crunches like this.
},
{
    229.62,231.3
     Just to work the abdominal muscles
},
{
    231.3,234.12
     because when these muscles contract,
},
{
    234.12,235.8
     the opposite muscles,
},
{
    235.8,237.7
     they're logically relaxed.
},
{
    237.7,239.34
     You don't even have to think about it.
},
{
    239.34,242.34
     And we're only gonna do 10 of those, okay?
},
{
    242.34,244.3
     And, you know, it puts very little
},
{
    244.3,245.76
     to no stress on the back.
},
{
    245.76,247.24
     I've seen people do that to Brad
},
{
    247.24,248.94
     where they actually just do a little bit
},
{
    248.94,250.04
     of marching with their legs.
},
{
    250.04,250.88
     Oh, sure.
},
{
    250.88,252.72
     Yeah, and it's the same thing.
},
{
    252.72,255.12
     It's kicking in the abdominal muscles.
},
{
    255.12,255.96
     Yep.
},
{
    255.96,257.88
     And makes the back muscles relax.
},
{
    257.88,260.12
     So like I've seen it with back spasms.
},
{
    260.12,260.96
     Sure.
},
{
    260.96,262.96
     That this actually, you don't even have to lift up the head.
},
{
    262.96,264.68
     You just move the legs up and down.
},
{
    264.68,266.28
     But we're gonna go over seven minutes.
},
{
    266.28,268.16
     All right, okay, sorry.
},
{
    268.16,269.0
     But it was a good point.
},
{
    269.0,269.84
     I feel like I had to jump in.
},
{
    269.84,270.98
     It's a good option.
},
{
    270.98,273.28
     Now, when you roll over, particularly if your back
},
{
    273.28,276.2
     and your leg is, sorry, you're gonna do this very slowly
},
{
    276.2,279.8
     like you're a log and roll over, take your time.
},
{
    279.8,281.88
     Everything moves together at the same time.
},
{
    281.88,285.06
     Yeah, and then you need to have a pillow available.
},
{
    285.06,287.32
     And we're gonna take this pillow
},
{
    287.32,289.68
     and you're gonna bring it underneath your stomach
},
{
    289.68,290.52
     and the hip area.
},
{
    290.52,292.88
     You can put it this way or this way.
},
{
    292.88,293.72
     Length wise.
},
{
    293.72,294.56
     Yep.
},
{
    294.56,295.4
     I'm gonna do it this way.
},
{
    295.4,297.96
     And that's something that depends on the individual.
},
{
    297.96,299.6
     And we're just gonna lay here like this.
},
{
    299.6,301.28
     If that feels comfortable, you're gonna hang out.
},
{
    301.28,302.4
     You're gonna lie there, Brad.
},
{
    302.4,303.24
     Oh.
},
{
    303.24,304.36
     I'm learning my English.
},
{
    304.36,305.86
     I appreciate it, Bob. I really appreciate it. You're gonna lie there Brad. Oh. I'm learning my English. I appreciate it Bob.
},
{
    305.86,307.0
     I really appreciate it.
},
{
    307.0,308.96
     English has always been a problem for me.
},
{
    308.96,312.44
     And so we're gonna lie here like this.
},
{
    312.44,315.76
     If this feels good and the leg is feeling good
},
{
    315.76,319.16
     and the pain's literally going away from the foot
},
{
    319.16,322.3
     and then the calf and the knee area,
},
{
    322.3,323.92
     then we're gonna go up to here.
},
{
    323.92,325.28
     So what we're looking for,
},
{
    325.28,326.96
     I'm gonna do it on this side, Brad, okay?
},
{
    326.96,328.76
     Just a matter of convenience.
},
{
    328.76,329.6
     That's fine, yep.
},
{
    329.6,332.76
     So let's say this stripe represents his pain.
},
{
    332.76,333.6
     Yes.
},
{
    333.6,336.68
     What you wanna see is that pain actually starts to move up
},
{
    336.68,339.08
     away from the calf and foot first.
},
{
    339.08,339.92
     Right.
},
{
    339.92,342.64
     So now he just feels it in this area here.
},
{
    342.64,346.12
     Right, so if that's the case, leave it there Bob, cause you're feeling better.
},
{
    346.12,346.96
     Okay.
},
{
    346.96,350.2
     Then I'm gonna start doing some mini press ups.
},
{
    350.2,353.72
     Like this, letting my waist and pelvis
},
{
    353.72,355.4
     stay glued to the pillow.
},
{
    355.4,358.24
     Do that 10 times and as long as things feel the same
},
{
    358.24,359.96
     or get better.
},
{
    359.96,361.8
     This stripe might even go up further now.
},
{
    361.8,365.12
     Yep, then it's time to get rid of the pillow.
},
{
    365.12,367.28
     And then I'm gonna lay flat again.
},
{
    367.28,369.44
     Give it about 30 seconds to see how it goes.
},
{
    369.44,370.28
     Yeah, this is a nice progression
},
{
    370.28,371.24
     of what he's doing here.
},
{
    371.24,375.36
     Yep, now we're on step number four.
},
{
    375.36,377.4
     I believe we're at five.
},
{
    377.4,381.12
     It doesn't matter how we do this, it's the same.
},
{
    381.12,382.68
     You're on step number five right?
},
{
    382.68,384.88
     Yeah, so as long as this goes good,
},
{
    384.88,386.24
     we can just prone on elbows.
},
{
    386.24,388.84
     Prone on elbows, kind of hang out there.
},
{
    388.84,391.44
     Now there's a little, if you can wiggle it around a little bit,
},
{
    391.44,393.56
     sometimes that can help relieve the pain.
},
{
    393.56,395.32
     I had a patient that loved doing that, Brad.
},
{
    395.32,396.72
     He would get up on his elbows
},
{
    396.72,398.24
     and he would wiggle back and forth
},
{
    398.24,400.4
     and it just, it seemed like it started
},
{
    400.4,402.12
     improving the pain down the leg.
},
{
    402.12,404.5
     Now, if all of a sudden, if you notice you wiggle
},
{
    404.5,405.4
     to the right and that clearly makes the leg if you notice, you wiggle to the right,
},
{
    405.4,407.52
     and that clearly makes the leg feel better,
},
{
    407.52,409.2
     and you'll wiggle to the other direction,
},
{
    409.2,411.72
     it feels worse, just go to the one direction,
},
{
    411.72,415.32
     and that can be a big step in the right direction as well.
},
{
    415.32,416.68
     So listen to your body.
},
{
    416.68,420.04
     Any little thing that makes the pain go up the leg,
},
{
    420.04,422.04
     like this, is better,
},
{
    422.04,426.04
     and then I'm gonna start doing mini press ups.
},
{
    426.04,428.12
     See now the difference is the pillow's gone.
},
{
    428.12,431.28
     So there's a little more stress on the back
},
{
    431.28,434.36
     because he was doing mini push ups,
},
{
    434.36,436.32
     press ups before with the pillow in place.
},
{
    436.32,438.68
     And that would be a positive stress stress.
},
{
    438.68,439.52
     That was good for you.
},
{
    439.52,440.36
     That's a lot of peas.
},
{
    440.36,441.2
     Yeah.
},
{
    441.2,443.64
     Mini press up with the pillow and be positive.
},
{
    443.64,446.16
     And I am not gonna finish off the rest.
},
{
    446.16,448.48
     Bob's gonna get on here and finish off
},
{
    448.48,450.28
     because I have spondylastasis,
},
{
    450.28,452.88
     which means I cannot do full press ups
},
{
    452.88,455.08
     without creating back problems.
},
{
    455.08,457.36
     So he's been doing the mini press ups.
},
{
    457.36,460.52
     He got to that point, hands underneath the shoulder.
},
{
    460.52,462.04
     He's doing the mini press ups.
},
{
    462.04,463.72
     It's still feeling very good.
},
{
    463.72,466.18
     The pain is still traveling up the leg, looking its way up. It's no longer mini press ups. It's still feeling very good. The pain's still traveling up the leg,
},
{
    466.18,467.54
     walking its way up.
},
{
    467.54,469.02
     It's no longer felt down here.
},
{
    469.02,471.52
     It's never no longer felt down in my calf.
},
{
    471.52,474.56
     So now I'm gonna go see if I can go further and further.
},
{
    474.56,478.1
     Now the idea here is that you do not lift the pelvis up.
},
{
    478.1,480.86
     If you're lifting up the pelvis, your back is too tight
},
{
    480.86,483.98
     and you need to continue to work on the mini press ups.
},
{
    483.98,486.0
     But if the back is starting to allow you,
},
{
    486.0,487.5
     you wanna go ahead and get to the point
},
{
    487.5,488.76
     where you get way up like this.
},
{
    488.76,493.24
     And we even have some advanced things you can do beyond this.
},
{
    493.24,495.96
     Just watch, we're gonna have a full sciatica program
},
{
    495.96,499.68
     on Bob and Brad on our website
},
{
    499.68,501.96
     and it's under the program section.
},
{
    501.96,504.32
     And it's got 40 some videos on sciatica.
},
{
    504.32,505.04
     Right. And they're all 40 some videos on sciatica. Right.
},
{
    505.04,506.04
     And they're all free.
},
{
    506.04,507.12
     There's no charge.
},
{
    507.12,510.28
     And you get PDF printouts of the exercises.
},
{
    510.28,512.52
     So you don't have to come back and look at our ugly mugs.
},
{
    512.52,513.64
     You can just look at the paper.
},
{
    513.64,515.88
     We're uploading them right now as we speak.
},
{
    515.88,517.28
     So it's gonna take a while,
},
{
    517.28,519.96
     but eventually when you go to our channel,
},
{
    519.96,520.8
     you'll find them there.
},
{
    520.8,521.64
     Right.
},
{
    521.64,524.08
     So you can go through the whole procedure,
},
{
    524.08,525.48
     the seven steps.
},
{
    525.48,527.16
     When you're done, things should be feeling better.
},
{
    527.16,528.44
     The leg pain is better.
},
{
    528.44,531.68
     And you can repeat this a number of times per day.
},
{
    532.76,534.96
     To be honest with you, once you start feeling better,
},
{
    534.96,537.0
     you don't have to do the first couple of steps.
},
{
    537.0,539.28
     Although you can, they're not gonna hurt you.
},
{
    539.28,541.12
     Actually it's gonna be good for you,
},
{
    541.12,543.0
     but it's not absolutely critical.
},
{
    543.0,544.6
     So use your best judgment.
},
{
    544.6,547.92
     The whole goal is to get to that last press up
},
{
    547.92,548.76
     that Bob was doing.
},
{
    548.76,551.44
     The more the more motion you get,
},
{
    551.44,553.6
     generally that's where the magic happens.
},
{
    553.6,556.4
     Remember, you need to say that the more and you know,
},
{
    556.4,558.96
     so eventually you can maybe just go right into that.
},
{
    558.96,562.96
     You know, you go right to the, if you want to move your breath.
},
{
    562.96,566.44
     Go right to the floor and you can start doing these press ups.
},
{
    566.44,570.12
     You can try to do full ones if your body's waiting for it.
},
{
    570.12,572.52
     I mean, I do these preventively.
},
{
    572.52,576.6
     I do some mini ones and I do some full stretches every day.
},
{
    576.6,578.64
     I do them a couple of times a day
},
{
    578.64,581.48
     because it keeps my back out of trouble.
},
{
    581.48,584.28
     So again, you're not going to jump into that one
},
{
    584.28,587.48
     unless by that time your leg pain is pretty much gone
},
{
    587.48,589.72
     and you're getting into that maintenance phase.
},
{
    589.72,592.96
     So yeah, it's a wonderful program.
},
{
    592.96,596.2
     Work with it as we instruct it and...
},
{
    596.2,597.04
     Give us your comments below.
},
{
    597.04,598.38
     You'll do well, very well.
},
{
    598.38,599.92
     Remember Brad and I can fix just about anything.
},
{
    599.92,600.88
     Except for...
},
{
    600.88,601.84
     A broken heart.
},
{
    601.84,603.48
     But we're working on that Bob.
},
{
    603.48,605.02
     We did a lot on backs, but we haven't done much on hearts. Yeah, yeah, but we're we're working on that, Bob. Get a lot on backs.
},
{
    605.02,606.16
     But we haven't done much on hearts.
},
{
    606.16,609.16
     Yeah, yeah, but we're gonna continue to work on this, Bob.
},
{
    609.16,611.2
     It's one of those things when we retire,
},
{
    611.2,612.64
     we can continue to work on it too.
},
{
    612.64,613.96
     I'm playing him, by the way.
},
{
    613.96,614.8
     That's not being gotten.
},
{
    614.8,615.64
     Bye!
},
{
    615.64,None
     Thanks for watching. you
},
