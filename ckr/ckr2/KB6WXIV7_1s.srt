     Hi I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist, Brad Handed physical therapist and together we
},
{
    4.96,8.52
     are the most famous physical therapists on the internet. Well in our opinion of course
},
{
    8.52,13.84
     Bob. Brad we just did a video on how to do the Epley maneuver to the right now
},
{
    13.84,17.52
     we're going to do it to the left. Okay. We're going to jump right into this. Alright. This time we're
},
{
    17.52,21.08
     doing with the pillow we're also going to show it without the pillow but you need
},
{
    21.08,24.48
     a pretty you know it's good you can do it on the bed if the laundry bed is fairly
},
{
    24.48,28.56
     firm. The other thing remember we got a brand, can you just stand up for sure?
},
{
    28.56,33.8
     Sure. And we got to show what a 45 degree angle is. All right, when you face
},
{
    33.8,38.6
     straightforward that's zero degrees, if he turns all the way to the right, that's
},
{
    38.6,43.0
     90 degrees, although you're looking at it a little tighter, right? Halfway in between,
},
{
    43.0,46.9
     that's 45. You need to know what a 45 degree angle is
},
{
    46.9,49.06
     because we're gonna do that a number of times.
},
{
    49.06,51.3
     We're also gonna bring the head back, probably,
},
{
    51.3,52.42
     yeah, there we go.
},
{
    52.42,54.42
     We're gonna bring the head back, probably 20 degrees,
},
{
    54.42,56.34
     maybe 30 degrees.
},
{
    56.34,57.18
     So you need that?
},
{
    57.18,58.02
     Not that, not that.
},
{
    58.02,61.14
     It's just about a little tilt back, okay?
},
{
    61.14,62.9
     So you know how high 45 is?
},
{
    62.9,64.22
     You know what, 20 to 30.
},
{
    64.22,65.28
     All right, Brad, jump up there. These people aren't hurt. All right, there you know what 45 is? You know what 20 to 30. All right, Brad, jump up there.
},
{
    65.28,71.0
     These people are in a hurry. Let's go. All right, we're going to start with, and we're doing this to the left.
},
{
    71.0,76.0
     So you're going to, let me just, simply to the left, you're going to turn your head 45 degrees to the left.
},
{
    76.0,81.0
     You're using a pillow, and that's going to hit you between the shoulder blades, and it goes down.
},
{
    81.0,86.04
     And now he tilts back about 20 to 30 degrees with the angle still maintaining
},
{
    86.04,87.92
     at 45 degrees.
},
{
    87.92,89.36
     You keep your eyes open.
},
{
    89.36,90.96
     He may get dizzy from this.
},
{
    90.96,92.48
     He may get a little vertigo.
},
{
    92.48,95.16
     He may get the eye shifting back and forth.
},
{
    95.16,101.04
     You wait until that goes away or 20 seconds, whichever one comes first.
},
{
    101.04,105.58
     After that, then, you go ahead and turn your head 45 degrees to the right. Same
},
{
    105.58,109.18
     thing you're gonna wait for the symptoms to go away or you're gonna wait for the
},
{
    109.18,116.72
     20 seconds to finish. After that you're gonna go up onto the right shoulder and
},
{
    116.72,119.68
     when you get up to the right shoulder you're gonna look down completely look
},
{
    119.68,123.9
     down. Same thing you're waiting for 20 seconds or you're waiting for the
},
{
    123.9,126.0
     symptoms to abate.
},
{
    126.0,129.0
     Alright, now he's going to bring his legs off the edge.
},
{
    129.0,132.0
     Now he's going to push off with his arm.
},
{
    132.0,137.0
     He's keeping his head tilted to the right and then he slowly brings it to the center.
},
{
    137.0,143.0
     After this, now it's very important, I hope you understand this because we talked about this in the last video,
},
{
    143.0,147.58
     I want you to keep your head upright for the rest of the day.
},
{
    147.58,149.14
     Brad and I were talking about this.
},
{
    149.14,152.14
     That's why this is probably a good thing to do in the morning even to give plenty of time
},
{
    152.14,155.18
     for those crystals to settle in the right spot.
},
{
    155.18,157.14
     But you want to keep it up for the rest of the day.
},
{
    157.14,162.18
     They used to stay for 48 hours and we used to have people wear a collar to sleep upright.
},
{
    162.18,167.0
     But now they say that you can just do it until the end of the day and then you should get good results.
},
{
    167.0,169.28
     So now we're about I can't look down.
},
{
    169.28,173.44
     You can't bend down, you can't put shoes on, you can't.
},
{
    173.44,174.72
     So I'm going to be doing this.
},
{
    174.72,175.72
     Yeah.
},
{
    175.72,177.28
     You're going to have to turn right to left.
},
{
    177.28,178.28
     Yeah.
},
{
    178.28,180.2
     You can do all those things just keep your head up.
},
{
    180.2,181.2
     Yeah.
},
{
    181.2,182.2
     All right.
},
{
    182.2,185.1
     Now we're also going to show you this from a side angle so you know another way to do
},
{
    185.1,186.1
     it.
},
{
    186.1,189.72
     Alright, okay now we're going to do it from the side position and we're doing it this
},
{
    189.72,194.48
     time without a pillow so he can just hang his head off the edge of the bed.
},
{
    194.48,196.48
     Head off the edge of the bed.
},
{
    196.48,200.48
     Okay, first again, turn his, tilt his head 45 degrees to the right and he's going to
},
{
    200.48,201.48
     come back.
},
{
    201.48,202.48
     Left.
},
{
    202.48,203.48
     I'm sorry.
},
{
    203.48,208.52
     Turn his head 45 degrees to the left and then he's going to come back. Left. I'm sorry. Turn his head 45 degrees to the left and then he's going to come back.
},
{
    208.52,213.2
     And he's going to tilt back about 20 to 30 degrees while he's maintaining his head 45
},
{
    213.2,214.72
     degrees to the left.
},
{
    214.72,219.6
     Again, eyes open, waiting for the symptoms to stop for 20 seconds.
},
{
    219.6,222.32
     Then turns his head to the right.
},
{
    222.32,226.66
     Eyes open, waiting for the symptoms to stop. Nausea, dizziness,
},
{
    226.66,232.84
     eye shaking, whatever you feel. Alright, after that stops, now Brad's going to go
},
{
    232.84,238.66
     up onto the right shoulder, keeping his head and then he's going to actually look
},
{
    238.66,243.44
     down, down to the floor. Same thing, waiting for the symptoms to abate,
},
{
    243.44,246.16
     waiting for the, or 20 seconds. He's now going to push himself thing, waiting for the symptoms to abate, waiting for the or 20
},
{
    246.16,251.28
     seconds. He's then going to push himself up, legs off the edge, push himself up,
},
{
    251.28,258.52
     head still turned to the right, now he slowly turns to the left. Okay, going to
},
{
    258.52,261.4
     keep your head off the rest of his a, right Brad? Right here. Keep your chin up, right?
},
{
    261.4,268.16
     Mm-hmm. All right, again this this was for benign, proximal, positional vertigo.
},
{
    268.16,272.56
     This is the most common form of vertigo that you're going to find.
},
{
    272.56,276.36
     We're assuming that you were probably diagnosed by your physician with this.
},
{
    276.36,280.64
     And in this instance, we were showing you a person that gets symptoms mostly when they
},
{
    280.64,282.6
     turn to the left or roll to the left.
},
{
    282.6,286.32
     It all seems to be left-sided.
},
{
    286.32,289.96
     With vertical benign position, approximate positional
},
{
    289.96,292.68
     vertical, there's really three types.
},
{
    292.68,295.48
     And it all depends on which canal it's in.
},
{
    295.48,297.32
     This is the most, the one we showed you
},
{
    297.32,299.32
     involves the posterior canal.
},
{
    299.32,302.28
     And that's involved 76% of the time.
},
{
    302.28,308.84
     And the one we showed you, that involves that one. if you're not having any luck with this because most people
},
{
    308.84,312.92
     I think it was like 80% have good luck with this for a third time
},
{
    313.24,318.48
     If you're not any luck with it might be one of your other canals and you probably should try one of the other maneuvers
},
{
    318.48,322.28
     Which we will be showing in the future sure so you want to keep that in mind
},
{
    322.28,325.54
     It's the little debris and crystals or rocks or whatever you want to call
},
{
    325.54,330.28
     Yeah, yeah, so all right anything else Brad you want to say at this time?
},
{
    330.28,334.8
     Well Bob I'm thinking that if you want to continue to get information like this issues
},
{
    335.52,342.92
     Right to us right if you're 40 and over and you want to stay have information on stay healthy and fit and pain-free and
},
{
    343.12,349.24
     have information on how to stay healthy and fit and pain-free and vibrant and no busyness. No misery, no love. Subscribe. Is it below an inch? It's up.
},
{
    349.24,351.52
     It's down. It's below. It's somewhere.
},
{
    351.52,379.08
     I'm gonna buy that. Thank you.
},
