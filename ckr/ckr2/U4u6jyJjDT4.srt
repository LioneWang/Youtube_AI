     Hi, I'm Juliet Gibson.
},
{
    11.36,15.68
     I am a board certified dermatologist practicing at Trinity Dermatology, which is a member
},
{
    15.68,18.44
     of U.S. dermatology partners.
},
{
    18.44,24.72
     One very common reason I see patients is for lesions of concern, like a growth that they're
},
{
    24.72,25.28
     concerned about.
},
{
    25.28,31.48
     Is this skin cancer? Is this okay? And so just some general tips on when you want
},
{
    31.48,35.6
     to seek a dermatologist. I tell patients to look out for things that are
},
{
    35.6,41.48
     changing, changing in color, size, symptoms. Maybe they didn't feel anything and
},
{
    41.48,48.28
     now it's getting painful or itchy itchy And I tell patients especially things that are
},
{
    48.88,53.72
     Bleeding you want to see a dermatologist things that are not healing
},
{
    53.72,59.5
     So if something's not healing in a few weeks, you definitely need to see your dermatologist to get that checked out
},
{
    61.12,65.12
     There are definitely certain things that will put you at a higher risk for getting a skin
},
{
    65.12,66.56
     cancer.
},
{
    66.56,72.68
     One is if you are fair skinned or you have light hair, light eyes, and if it's hard for
},
{
    72.68,78.44
     you to tan, so if you're usually burning and if you've had blistering sunburns in
},
{
    78.44,82.4
     the past, that puts you at a little bit of a higher risk.
},
{
    82.4,87.12
     If you've had a skin cancer, you're at a higher risk. If
},
{
    87.12,91.84
     you have someone in your family who has a skin cancer, another thing that puts you at a higher
},
{
    91.84,97.28
     risk of skin cancer is a history of indoor tanning. So this is even if you did it once,
},
{
    97.28,101.36
     when you were in college, this still puts you kind of at a higher risk because of the
},
{
    101.36,105.36
     concentrated UV radiation you're getting in those sessions.
},
{
    105.36,106.72
     And so that would be something where
},
{
    106.72,108.36
     you'd want to come in and see dermatologists
},
{
    108.36,111.68
     to get a full body skin check.
},
{
    111.68,114.2
     There are three main types of skin cancer.
},
{
    114.2,116.76
     They're the non-melanoma skin cancer, such as basal cell
},
{
    116.76,119.68
     cancer and sueyma cell cancer.
},
{
    119.68,122.04
     And then there's melanoma.
},
{
    122.04,126.6
     Basal cell cancer is the most common cancer. and that is the most thing that you're most
},
{
    126.6,129.0
     likely to have.
},
{
    129.0,134.52
     That type of cancer is very rare to spread to other parts of your body, but it's very
},
{
    134.52,142.24
     important to get tested and to treat after the biopsy because it can grow and invade
},
{
    142.24,148.16
     local structures and cause some local damage.
},
{
    148.16,152.96
     Squamous cell cancers are kind of a little bit up from basal cell cancers and how aggressive
},
{
    152.96,153.96
     they are.
},
{
    153.96,160.76
     They can spread from place to place and especially if they have certain high risk features.
},
{
    160.76,166.72
     And then we have melanomas which is what this is our most serious type of skin cancer
},
{
    166.72,173.44
     that can spread to different areas of your body and is something that needs to be treated
},
{
    173.44,174.44
     aggressively.
},
{
    174.44,179.88
     And if in certain states, we hope to catch it at an early stage where that's all we have
},
{
    179.88,189.02
     to do is cut it out, but sometimes it's kind of past then. And then we're going to be working with an oncologist
},
{
    189.02,194.6
     and you, and to kind of come up with the best treatment plan.
},
{
    194.6,196.06
     Every dermatologist does it differently,
},
{
    196.06,198.46
     but what I do is I go from head to toe.
},
{
    198.46,199.82
     And so I look in your scalp.
},
{
    199.82,201.94
     I see if there's anything that I'm concerned about.
},
{
    201.94,207.24
     I look closely at your face, your arms, your chest, your back, I look at your legs.
},
{
    207.24,209.58
     I will ask you if you would like me to look
},
{
    209.58,212.68
     at your genitalia, because for a lot of women,
},
{
    212.68,215.08
     that happens at the OB-GYN as well.
},
{
    215.08,217.56
     So it's really, for me, my patients' preferences,
},
{
    217.56,219.4
     but I do like to screen there,
},
{
    219.4,222.56
     because skin cancer can occur on anywhere there is skin.
},
{
    223.32,226.08
     We'll look at your buttocks, we'll look inside
},
{
    226.08,230.8
     your mouth, we'll look at your eyes, and then we'll even look in between your toes and on
},
{
    230.8,235.88
     the bottoms of your feet. We're looking at all of the different spots that you have that
},
{
    235.88,242.72
     you may have noticed came up. We're looking for even textural changes that sometimes tell
},
{
    242.72,245.92
     us maybe that there is a pre-cancer.
},
{
    245.92,251.0
     We are looking for spots that maybe you didn't notice that aren't healing.
},
{
    251.0,257.4
     You can see the link below to do a skin cancer risk assessment to get an idea for your own
},
{
    257.4,259.76
     personal risk for skin cancer.
},
{
    259.76,263.6
     There's also a link below to schedule an appointment with a board certified dermatologist to get
},
{

     your full body skin exam.
