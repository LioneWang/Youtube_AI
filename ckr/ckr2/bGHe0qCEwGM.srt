     Hi, this is Dr. Kolo-Denker and we're going to go over how to tape the big toe joint for pain

     underneath the big toe joint, sesamoid pain, sesamoiditis, metatarsalgia. Basically the goal
},
{
    15.26,23.04
     of the taping is to keep the toe in a planar flexed downward position. The two bones down here,
},
{
    23.04,26.24
     the sesamoids, are connected with
},
{
    26.24,29.96
     ligaments. There are tendons that come in in attachment this way and typically a
},
{
    29.96,34.08
     strain will create pain around this area. So if you press around you'll
},
{
    34.08,39.04
     typically have a little bit of tenderness, swelling, pain. So by taping it down, it
},
{
    39.04,48.36
     will relieve some of the tension off the ligaments and the tendons and allow it to heal up. If you are active
},
{
    48.36,51.56
     you might need to cut down your activities, reevaluate your shoe gear,
},
{
    51.56,59.44
     and the taping will allow you to be more comfortable and recover faster. This is a

{
    59.44,71.8
     pre-cut KT tape. What you're going to do is basically measure it on the bottom of your foot and cut it so that way it ends at about this level of the big toe

{
    71.8,78.38
     joint. I also like to cut one side bigger than the other. It seems to make it
},
{
    78.38,85.88
     easier to stick. So then you peel back these layers. Now remember when you are applying KT tape
},
{
    85.88,88.88
     the beginning and end pieces
},
{
    88.88,94.38
     have no tension on them and the middle aspect is where all the tension takes place.
},
{
    97.9,101.88
     After doing this a few times you will also become an expert on taping.
},
{
    101.88,106.8
     So we're going to start from here. This is just to hold
},
{
    106.8,112.4
     the toe. So you don't have to worry about it being perfect. Next is where the
},
{
    112.4,115.8
     tension comes in. So you want to pull the toe in a little bit of a downward
},
{
    115.8,121.4
     position, about a 50% pull on the KT tape, and you're going to keep applying it
},
{
    121.4,127.44
     until you get to just about the very end. Stick it down and the end again has no tension. You just lay it down.
},
{
    129.92,134.88
     Depending on the quality of the tape, sometimes it'll last you all day.
},
{
    134.88,140.48
     Sometimes it'll only last a few hours. What you can always do is re-tape it.
},
{
    140.48,145.28
     You can apply another layer of tape and what you should feel is a pull of the big
},
{
    145.28,148.64
     toe joint in a downward position.

    148.64,152.56
     If you have any questions, comments, feel free to post them.
},
{
    152.56,156.32
     You can find the tape at your local pharmacies or you can purchase them online.
