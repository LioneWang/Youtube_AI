     Learning Objectives By the end of this video, the learner will
},
{
    35.82,42.62
     be able to explain the pathophysiology of Kawa Sake Disease, recognize the clinical features
},
{
    42.62,45.72
     and diagnostic criteria, describe the potential
},
{
    45.72,52.72
     complications, and discuss the important steps in managing a child with Kawasaki disease.
},
{
    52.72,53.72
     Introduction
},
{
    53.72,61.56
     Kawasaki disease is an acute systemic vasculitis of children. Approximately three-quarters of
},
{
    61.56,65.48
     children presenting with acute disease are younger than age five,
},
{
    65.48,69.68
     but Kawasaki disease can occur in older children as well.
},
{
    69.68,77.92
     Boys outnumber girls 1.3 to 1, and children of Asian ancestry are at highest risk.
},
{
    77.92,82.96
     The cause of Kawasaki disease is unknown, although most experts believe that Kawasaki
},
{
    82.96,85.0
     disease reflects an immune response
},
{
    85.0,88.24
     to an unknown infectious trigger.
},
{
    88.24,92.56
     Kawasaki disease, Arteritis, particularly affects the coronary arteries, and coronary
},
{
    92.56,98.16
     aneurysms are caused by vascular infiltration first of neutrophils, transitioning to large
},
{
    98.16,107.84
     mononuclear cells, along with lymphocytes and plasma cells, causing a weakening and dilatation of the vessel walls.
},
{
    107.84,111.72
     Clinical Presentation and Diagnosis
},
{
    111.72,114.4
     The clinical presentation of Kawasaki disease
},
{
    114.4,118.08
     can be remembered by the mnemonic crash and burn.
},
{
    118.08,120.68
     C is for conjunctivitis.
},
{
    120.68,123.08
     R is for rash.
},
{
    123.08,125.0
     A is for cervical adenopathy.
},
{
    125.0,128.0
     S is for strawberry tongue.
},
{
    128.0,134.0
     H is for hands and feet, which is to say swelling and erythema of those parts.
},
{
    134.0,138.0
     B is for burn, which is to say fever.
},
{
    138.0,146.08
     The diagnosis of classical Kawasaki disease can be made clinically based on the following criteria.
},
{
    152.0,153.12
     Fever for five or more days and at least four of the five clinical features from the crash mnemonic.
},
{
    157.04,158.48
     Conjunctivitis, which is typically bilateral and non-pureulent.
},
{
    163.92,165.4
     Rash, which is a polymorphic rash that can be seen on the trunk, extremities, and groin.
},
{
    165.4,171.48
     Adenopathy, which is cervical and unilateral, with the node being at least 1.5 centimeters
},
{
    171.48,173.48
     in diameter.
},
{
    173.48,178.76
     Strawberry tongue, or erythema of the tongue with prominent papillae, as well as erythema
},
{
    178.76,182.16
     of the oral mucosa and lips.
},
{
    182.16,186.48
     Changes in the hands and feet, which may include swelling and erythema in the acute
},
{
    186.48,188.16
     illness.
},
{
    188.16,193.0
     Periungal desquamation occurs two weeks after fever onset.
},
{
    193.0,197.74
     Patients who have less than four of the five principal clinical criteria who have fever
},
{
    197.74,203.36
     with coronary abnormalities can have incomplete Kawasaki disease.
},
{
    203.36,209.2
     For these patients, you can follow the American Heart Association algorithm for evaluation
},
{
    209.2,213.32
     of suspected incomplete Kawasaki disease.
},
{
    213.32,218.28
     If a child has a fever for greater than or equal to five days, with two or three of the
},
{
    218.28,226.76
     principal clinical criteria, or if an infant has a fever for greater than or equal to 7 days without another explanation,
},
{
    226.76,230.28
     the next step is to assess laboratory tests.
},
{
    230.28,239.4
     C-reactive protein, CRP, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, ESR, are markers of inflammation.
},
{
    239.4,247.6
     If the CRP is greater than or equal to 3 mg per deciliter, and or the ESR is greater than or equal to
},
{
    247.6,257.08
     40 mmHg assessed for anemia, thrombocytosis, hypoalbum anemia, elevated alanine amino
},
{
    257.08,263.74
     transferase or ALT, leukocytosis, and white blood cells in the urine.
},
{
    263.74,269.78
     If the patient has three or more of those findings, or has a positive echocardiogram,
},
{
    269.78,272.08
     treatment should be initiated.
},
{
    272.08,276.6
     In the absence of those features, the patient should be monitored clinically with repeat
},
{
    276.6,281.52
     laboratory testing if the fever persists.
},
{
    281.52,287.0
     A patient with Kawasaki disease is often very irritable and difficult to console.
},
{
    287.0,293.0
     In addition to the classic signs and symptoms, they may also have involvement of the musculoskeletal,
},
{
    293.0,301.96
     GI, GU, respiratory, nervous, and cardiovascular systems.
},
{
    301.96,308.0
     The most concerning potential complication of Kawasaki disease is coronary artery aneurysm,
},
{
    308.0,312.36
     which occurs in about 25% of untreated patients.
},
{
    312.36,319.68
     With timely treatment, fewer than 5% of children with Kawasaki disease develop aneurysms.
},
{
    319.68,324.64
     Given the wide range of potential clinical findings, a comprehensive physical exam is
},
{
    324.64,326.44
     essential.
},
{
    326.44,329.16
     Assess the general appearance of the child.
},
{
    329.16,330.88
     Is he irritable?
},
{
    330.88,333.2
     What are his vital signs?
},
{
    333.2,335.88
     Does he appear dehydrated?
},
{
    335.88,340.0
     Inspect the skin, including the extremities and the perineum.
},
{
    340.0,350.92
     If a rash is present, describe it. The rash of Kawasaki disease is most commonly maculopapular, but may also be morbiliform,
},
{
    350.92,353.58
     targetoid, or scarletiniform.
},
{
    353.58,359.2
     It is never vesicular.
},
{
    359.2,361.92
     Are the hands and feet edematous?
},
{
    361.92,365.32
     Are the palms and soles erythematous?
},
{
    365.32,368.72
     Is there any ischemia?
},
{
    368.72,371.96
     Complete a thorough HE-ENT exam.
},
{
    371.96,375.44
     Is there conjunctival injection?
},
{
    375.44,377.98
     Are the lips red or cracked?
},
{
    377.98,381.72
     Is the tongue red with prominent papillae?
},
{
    381.72,385.68
     Is the oropharynx erythematous?
},
{
    385.68,390.8
     Is there lymphadenopathy, and if so, is it unilateral or bilateral?
},
{
    390.8,392.68
     How big are the nodes?
},
{
    392.68,394.64
     Are they tender?
},
{
    394.64,401.48
     If the lymphadenopathy is diffuse, this is more suggestive of a viral illness.
},
{
    401.48,407.64
     It is also important to perform cardiac, respiratory, and abdominal examinations, although the findings
},
{
    407.64,413.24
     may be nonspecific for Kawasaki disease.
},
{
    413.24,414.24
     Management
},
{
    414.24,419.24
     All patients with Kawasaki disease should have an echocardiogram to look for coronary
},
{
    419.24,425.74
     aneurysms or dilatation, as well as other potential cardiac complications such as pericardial
},
{
    425.74,433.08
     effusion, valvular regurgitation, or decreased left ventricular function.
},
{
    433.08,438.08
     While laboratory tests aren't necessary for diagnosis, they can be helpful if the diagnosis
},
{
    438.08,440.56
     is not certain.
},
{
    440.56,450.0
     Several abnormalities may be present, including anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, elevated CRP and ESR,
},
{
    450.0,460.0
     hypoalbuminemia, elevated ALT, sterile pyuria, and CSF pleocytosis.
},
{
    461.0,467.82
     The main stages of treatment for Kawasaki disease are intravenous immunoglobulin, IVIG, and
},
{
    467.82,469.82
     aspirin.
},
{
    469.82,475.22
     IVIG, which contains antibodies from donated blood, should ideally be given as a one-time
},
{
    475.22,478.94
     dose within the first 10 days of the illness.
},
{
    478.94,483.9
     It works as an anti-inflammatory to decrease the risk of aneurysms, as well as to lower
},
{
    483.9,487.72
     fever.
},
{
    487.72,493.52
     Moderate to high dose aspirin is often given until the patient has been a. feb. for 48-72
},
{
    493.52,501.98
     hours, followed by low dose aspirin for 4-6 weeks or until aneurysms resolve.
},
{
    501.98,528.16
     Those patients who develop a fever after 36 hours post IVIG treatment without another explanation can have refractory Kawasaki disease and may be retreated with a second dose of IVIG or other anti-inflammatory therapies if Kawasaki disease is still the likely diagnosis. Appropriate follow-up for uncomplicated Kawasaki disease includes repeat echocardiography at
},
{
    528.16,533.46
     1-2 weeks and 4-6 weeks after treatment.
},
{
    533.46,539.0
     For patients with coronary artery aneurysms, cardiologic follow-up and treatment, including
},
{
    539.0,546.44
     antithrombotic therapies, are tailored to the severity of coronary involvement. Summary
},
{
    546.44,554.34
     In summary, Kawasaki disease is an acute systemic vasculitis of childhood that presents with
},
{
    554.34,561.02
     conjunctivitis, rash, lymphadenopathy, changes in the oropharynx, and changes on the hands
},
{
    561.02,562.68
     and feet.
},
{
    562.68,567.0
     The most concerning complication is coronary artery aneurysms,
},
{
    567.04,571.96
     and echocardiography should be performed on all patients.
},
{
    571.96,578.08
     Treatment includes IVIG and aspirin. Patients with always normal coronary arteries have
},
{
    578.08,589.0
     no increase in cardiovascular mortality compared with the general population. Children with coronary artery aneurysms, even those that remodel to normal, require
},
{
    589.0,591.44
     lifelong follow-up.
