     Now let's cover shock.
},
{
    4.36,9.12
     You know the interesting thing about shock, which is pretty much defined by saying it's
},
{
    9.12,14.96
     a failure of the body to circulate oxygenated blood to cells.
},
{
    14.96,19.88
     The interesting thing about that is that everybody who dies eventually dies from some form of
},
{
    19.88,21.16
     shock.
},
{
    21.16,25.3
     So when we're talking about emergency first aid, it's one of the things we'll always
},
{
    25.3,31.48
     be watching for along with airway breathing, circulation, bleeding control. Right after
},
{
    31.48,37.76
     we get into that circulation aspect, we think about shock symptoms. Shock is sometimes misunderstood
},
{
    37.76,45.88
     as shock like psychogenic shock or psychological emotional shock like scared or surprised.
},
{
    45.88,48.44
     But that's not the kind of shock we're talking about.
},
{
    48.44,52.4
     We're talking about one of the many forms of shock.
},
{
    52.4,58.52
     Forms meaning we could have spinal shock cause secondary to a spinal cord injury.
},
{
    58.52,62.32
     Cardiogenic shock, primarily from pump failure.
},
{
    62.32,67.0
     Hypovolemic shock from loss of fluids or blood, anaphylactic shock, which
},
{
    67.8,73.74
     is primarily caused from a severe alert reaction, and those are the main types of shock we'll
},
{
    73.74,80.74
     see out in the environment. The symptoms are pretty much going to be about the same though.
},
{
    80.74,87.1
     Decrease level of consciousness, anxiety, chilled and cold, pale, clammy.
},
{
    87.1,91.12
     Poor capillary refill. You pinch the nail bed,
},
{
    91.12,94.72
     usually takes two to three seconds to refill. If it takes more than that,
},
{
    94.72,98.52
     we're probably showing a delay in capillary refill,
},
{
    98.52,103.68
     which could be an early sign of shock. The rapid breathing, rapid pulse,
},
{
    103.68,107.64
     signs of shock. Many times we don't
},
{
    107.64,111.4
     know the reason why they're going into this shock unless there's an obvious
},
{
    111.4,116.72
     external trauma. But if it's an internal injury, if it's a brain injury, a heart
},
{
    116.72,120.48
     injury, we won't know exactly why they're going into shock. We'll just know
},
{
    120.48,123.88
     that they're showing the symptoms of shock. And when they do, we're going to
},
{
    123.88,125.84
     treat it the same way. If we haven And when they do, we're going to treat it the same way.
},
{
    125.84,128.44
     If we haven't already called 911,
},
{
    128.44,130.52
     we're going to make sure our scene is safe,
},
{
    130.52,132.88
     gloves are on, CPR shields available,
},
{
    132.88,135.72
     and activate emergency medical services.
},
{
    135.72,140.06
     Then treat the primary causes of that shock.
},
{
    140.06,141.36
     If they're unresponsive,
},
{
    141.36,143.84
     we're still going to check to see if they're breathing.
},
{
    143.84,147.08
     If they are unresponsive, we're still going to check to see if they're breathing. If they are breathing, fantastic.
},
{
    147.08,153.64
     Now we know we can move to the secondary issues, bleeding control, shock management, fracture
},
{
    153.64,154.84
     management.
},
{
    154.84,161.76
     In this case, he is breathing, he's pale, cool, sweaty, delayed capillary refill.
},
{
    161.76,165.44
     No obvious signs of external bleeding that would cause us any problems.
},
{
    165.44,171.32
     We can now treat for shock. Primary treatments for shock is laying them down. After we've
},
{
    171.32,176.12
     managed airway breathing and compressions, and it's not an issue, we want to make the
},
{
    176.12,185.12
     patient as warm as possible. Why? Keeping the body warm helps it compensate for shock.
},
{
    185.12,192.36
     If it doesn't have to vasodilate in its extremities, that helps it to shunt the blood to the main
},
{
    192.36,200.36
     areas of the body, brain, heart, the different vascular organs that need to be fed with oxygenated
},
{
    200.36,202.88
     blood to stay alive.
},
{
    202.88,207.0
     Keeping them warm helps that. So when we do our demonstration,
},
{
    207.0,211.84
     we'll show how we're going to cover the patient with a warm blanket to help them with this
},
{
    211.84,218.84
     issue. And then if we don't suspect any kind of spinal cord injury or hip injury or long
},
{
    218.84,226.24
     bone fracture, we're going to go ahead and elevate the legs, making sure to put the box or object to keep
},
{
    226.24,232.92
     their legs elevated above their heart somewhere around their knees so that we don't hyper-extend
},
{
    232.92,234.32
     their knees.
},
{
    234.32,239.72
     By elevating the legs, keeping them warm, laying them down, and then reassessing them
},
{
    239.72,245.96
     for breathing and circulation and controlling any other external injuries like external bleeding
},
{
    245.96,250.64
     is how we're going to help this person combat the effects of shock and give them a second
},
{
    250.64,254.76
     chance at survival.
},
{
    254.76,257.96
     The scene is safe, my gloves are on, my CPR shield is available.
},
{
    257.96,259.64
     Sir, sir are you alright?
},
{
    259.64,261.32
     Are you okay?
},
{
    261.32,264.84
     He appears to be breathing but he's not responsive.
},
{
    264.84,267.2
     You in the plaid shirt, go call 911 and come back.
},
{
    267.2,269.28
     I might need your help.
},
{
    269.28,276.72
     He does appear to be breathing, but he looks pale, cool, sweaty, low-capillary refill, slow-capillary
},
{
    276.72,278.92
     refill, and he's unresponsive.
},
{
    278.92,280.48
     I think he might be suffering from shock.
},
{
    280.48,281.48
     I'm going to elevate his legs.
},
{
    281.48,283.56
     Let me know how he got hurt.
},
{
    283.56,284.8
     Any back injuries?
},
{
    284.8,287.44
     We find out that we don't suspect any neck or back injuries.
},
{
    287.44,321.52
     I'm going to elevate the legs, being careful not to hyper extend the knees. Server, can you hear me?
},
{
    321.52,322.52
     Can you hear me?
},
{
    322.52,324.64
     He still appears to be breathing.
},
{
    324.64,328.6
     I do not see any external hemorrhaging or bleeding that needs to be controlled.
},
{
    328.6,333.28
     I'm just going to maintain reassessment every couple minutes, make sure that if there's
},
{
    333.28,336.28
     any problems I treat them, and wait for EMS to arrive.
},
