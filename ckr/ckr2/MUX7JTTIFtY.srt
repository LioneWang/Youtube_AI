{
    21.4,26.32
     10 ways to reduce knee, calf and ankle swelling and pain.
},
{
    26.32,30.0
     This is unfortunately a part of sometimes aging,
},
{
    30.0,32.48
     sometimes different processes can be going on
},
{
    32.48,33.8
     that cause swelling.
},
{
    33.8,35.8
     And obviously you need to check with your doctor
},
{
    35.8,39.48
     if this is new and you don't know what's causing it.
},
{
    39.48,40.32
     Right.
},
{
    40.32,41.24
     I mean, if you sprained your ankle,
},
{
    41.24,42.84
     these could work as well,
},
{
    42.84,44.72
     depending on what phase of injury is.
},
{
    44.72,47.12

{
    82.48,83.36
     There you go, Bob.
},
{
    83.36,86.5
     Okay, 10 ways to reduce the swelling and pain
},
{
    86.5,87.44
     that you're having.
},
{
    87.44,90.78
     Oftentimes, if you have swelling, there's pain.
},
{
    90.78,92.36
     If there's pain, they're swelling.
},
{
    92.36,94.84
     They go together very, you know, more than that.
},
{
    94.84,96.76
     You can also get skin breakdown.
},
{
    96.76,98.68
     I mean, you can get weeping.
},
{
    98.68,100.64
     You can actually get fluid buildup.
},
{
    100.64,102.68
     When you got that edema that's really swelling up,
},
{
    102.68,104.12
     literally like a balloon.
},
{
    104.12,105.6
     It can get that bad.
},
{
    105.6,107.68
     So we're gonna show you some techniques,
},
{
    107.68,110.34
     five of them in the seated position,
},
{
    110.34,112.32
     and five in the standing position,
},
{
    112.32,114.6
     depending on what you're doing with your work
},
{
    114.6,116.32
     or at home duties.
},
{
    116.32,120.16
     So first one, sitting down, this is really critical.
},
{
    120.16,122.04
     You really have to address this
},
{
    122.04,125.44
     as the height of your chair or your feet,
},
{
    125.44,129.94
     we wanna set it up so that the edge of the chair right here
},
{
    129.94,132.68
     does not push in to your hamstrings
},
{
    132.68,134.62
     or the back of your thigh.
},
{
    134.62,138.68
     Because if I sit like this and I'm going forward,
},
{
    138.68,142.48
     that edge is pushing in and that's literally
},
{
    142.48,145.0
     restricting flow of that swelling.
},
{
    145.42,149.06
     The swelling has to come back up to your lymph nodes
},
{
    149.06,151.74
     as well as your venous return.
},
{
    151.74,154.22
     And if that is limiting that.
},
{
    154.22,155.18
     It's cutting it off.
},
{
    155.18,156.02
     It is.
},
{
    156.02,156.86
     It's like a tourniquet.
},
{
    156.86,157.94
     It's cut off, pressure.
},
{
    157.94,159.34
     It's like a half a tourniquet.
},
{
    159.34,162.9
     So we need to change your posture.
},
{
    162.9,166.04
     You can either raise the seat or lower it.
},
{
    166.04,167.52
     You know, if you just get a cushion,
},
{
    167.52,171.0
     this is a cushion that we use about two inches,
},
{
    171.0,173.18
     and it makes the seat more comfortable.
},
{
    173.18,174.48
     And that might be a-
},
{
    174.48,177.2
     You can see that cut, that eliminated the cutoff pressure.
},
{
    177.2,179.04
     Right, exactly.
},
{
    179.04,182.36
     It might be, if you're, you can't change that,
},
{
    182.36,186.6
     you might wanna put something under your feet to raise it up so you can get,
},
{
    186.6,189.28
     you should be able to get your fingers underneath here.
},
{
    189.28,191.0
     And then you know you have adequate.
},
{
    191.0,193.28
     The other thing, this is kind of on the fly here, Brad,
},
{
    193.28,196.24
     because it wasn't part of your board.
},
{
    196.24,197.64
     I'll let it go, Bob.
},
{
    197.64,200.36
     You really wanna have your knees not bent back like this.
},
{
    200.36,203.28
     This even cuts off pressure, you know, a little bit too.
},
{
    203.28,204.32
     That's an excellent point.
},
{
    204.32,206.8
     You're better off having your legs,
},
{
    206.8,208.4
     this is better for your knees too by the way.
},
{
    208.4,209.24
     Sure.
},
{
    209.24,212.0
     As you get older, these are things you gotta think about.
},
{
    212.0,213.32
     It's actually better to have your legs
},
{
    213.32,214.6
     a little bit straighter than bent.
},
{
    214.6,215.92
     I always tell my patients,
},
{
    215.92,218.04
     imagine a garden hose when you kick it,
},
{
    218.04,221.12
     it reduces the circulation, same thing with your knees.
},
{
    221.12,222.84
     That's the good analogy.
},
{
    222.84,224.72
     Okay, the next thing you can do,
},
{
    224.72,227.72
     once you know you have good circulation under the calves
},
{
    227.72,230.3
     is simply ankle pumps.
},
{
    230.3,232.8
     Up and down, 10 to 20 of them.
},
{
    232.8,234.56
     And make sure you pull them up good and far.
},
{
    234.56,235.96
     Stretch those calves out.
},
{
    235.96,238.3
     So what we're doing is we're working the muscles here.
},
{
    238.3,242.28
     That's the natural way to act as a pump
},
{
    242.28,244.0
     to pump that fluid out.
},
{
    244.0,245.64
     Sure, own body's natural pump.
},
{
    245.64,248.24
     That's trying to get that fluid back up into the abdomen
},
{
    248.24,251.28
     where it can be processed and you can pee it out.
},
{
    251.28,252.64
     Yeah, exactly.
},
{
    252.64,256.96
     And the other thing is we're gonna do long arc quads or kicks.
},
{
    256.96,259.8
     And this not only helps with the muscle contraction
},
{
    259.8,262.6
     of the fluid, but if you do have pain in your joints,
},
{
    262.6,265.46
     there's a very good chance that the pain is
},
{
    265.46,268.24
     from lack of motion in the joints.
},
{
    268.24,270.2
     So we not only wanna increase circulation,
},
{
    270.2,271.96
     but get the joints moving.
},
{
    271.96,274.24
     And about 10 on each leg would be perfect.
},
{
    274.24,276.28
     So I guess it's pretty difficult, Brad,
},
{
    276.28,278.08
     to go up further and do butt squeezes,
},
{
    278.08,280.56
     because that's what we have you do in bed.
},
{
    280.56,281.4
     Right.
},
{
    281.4,282.76
     If you're lying down in bed.
},
{
    282.76,285.28
     Well, Bob, the title says knee, calf and ankle. We're not talking about the butt. No, but we're trying to push the floor. I know, I down in bed. Well Bob, the title says knee, calf and ankle.
},
{
    285.28,286.76
     We're not talking about the butt.
},
{
    286.76,288.52
     No, but we're trying to push the floor.
},
{
    288.52,289.76
     I know, I'm just kidding.
},
{
    289.76,291.16
     We're trying to push the floor all the way up.
},
{
    291.16,292.48
     You can get up this high.
},
{
    292.48,294.84
     Now you want to use the butt to push it up harder.
},
{
    294.84,296.64
     Right, the kebab is exactly right.
},
{
    296.64,299.12
     That the lymph goes up and it actually goes back
},
{
    299.12,301.6
     into the system, above the belt line.
},
{
    301.6,303.84
     So that is helpful as well.
},
{
    303.84,305.92
     Now, the other thing that you can do
},
{
    305.92,310.64
     is get a device or something so you can get your feet moving,
},
{
    310.64,314.0
     whether if you're at a desk or just sitting at a table.
},
{
    314.0,317.76
     I'm gonna show a device that we started out with years ago
},
{
    317.76,319.96
     with a lot of our patients.
},
{
    319.96,321.8
     It's one of these literally ellipticals.
},
{
    321.8,323.68
     This is called the end motion.
},
{
    323.68,326.32
     And you can put your feet on there
},
{
    326.32,327.88
     and you just start the pedal.
},
{
    327.88,330.72
     You get some ankle, you get some knee range emotion
},
{
    330.72,334.48
     and you get some exercise, muscle contraction,
},
{
    334.48,337.4
     doing everything we want as well.
},
{
    337.4,339.28
     I had a patient Brad's that
},
{
    339.28,341.4
     and we use this a lot in the clinic too.
},
{
    341.4,346.28
     I mean, a lot of our elderly patients use these.
},
{
    346.6,349.98
     But this alone control the swelling
},
{
    349.98,351.56
     because he would do it every day.
},
{
    351.56,353.12
     And if he didn't do it,
},
{
    353.12,355.6
     he'd get some puffiness in his leg.
},
{
    355.6,358.8
     There's a couple of disadvantages to this particular model.
},
{
    358.8,362.28
     The number one thing is that it weighs about 40 pounds.
},
{
    362.28,363.12
     Oh, it's a beast.
},
{
    363.12,364.8
     It is really heavy.
},
{
    364.8,367.64
     It's just a beast like Bob says to move.
},
{
    367.64,368.98
     Ah.
},
{
    368.98,369.82
     So.
},
{
    369.82,371.14
     Ah.
},
{
    371.14,371.98
     Bob.
},
{
    371.98,373.76
     Yeah, well I'm not exaggerating.
},
{
    373.76,376.4
     I don't like lifting them.
},
{
    376.4,378.8
     So there is another device that's called a knee glide,
},
{
    378.8,379.64
     which only weighs.
},
{
    379.64,380.48
     A fit glide.
},
{
    380.48,381.32
     Fit glide, I'm sorry.
},
{
    381.32,383.28
     It's so close to the knee glide.
},
{
    383.28,386.68
     But it weighs about less than five pounds.
},
{
    386.68,388.36
     Look at this, Brad, I gotta do this.
},
{
    388.36,389.2
     Oh, Bob, good little finger.
},
{
    389.2,390.88
     I love doing this, yep.
},
{
    390.88,393.44
     So, you can do fit with curls with it.
},
{
    393.44,395.72
     Now you can grab it by this handle,
},
{
    395.72,396.6
     it's a little more awkward,
},
{
    396.6,399.24
     but you can also grab it by this one.
},
{
    399.24,400.4
     It does slam down like that,
},
{
    400.4,402.96
     but it works well for carrying around.
},
{
    402.96,405.16
     It works best just to carry her like this.
},
{
    405.16,406.52
     Sure.
},
{
    406.52,409.64
     So anyways, we're gonna put this down
},
{
    409.64,411.88
     and this is a really nice thing to do.
},
{
    411.88,414.64
     And you can use this under the desk, at home,
},
{
    414.64,416.32
     in a wheelchair, both of these,
},
{
    416.32,419.32
     if you are in a wheelchair, it works very well.
},
{
    419.32,420.84
     If it's a little bit too loud for you,
},
{
    420.84,422.68
     cause it makes a swish-wish sound,
},
{
    422.68,424.3
     what you can do is you can actually
},
{
    424.3,425.36
     put a little silicone
},
{
    425.36,427.96
     on it, and it, she really slides in.
},
{
    427.96,431.9
     So, but this is a great exercise device
},
{
    431.9,434.12
     for mom, dad, grandma, grandpa.
},
{
    434.12,434.96
     You know what I mean?
},
{
    434.96,435.8
     All right.
},
{
    435.8,437.92
     I've, you know, this is one of those things that,
},
{
    437.92,440.96
     I had a person, you said his desk.
},
{
    440.96,441.8
     Sure.
},
{
    441.8,443.14
     Underneath, he had the knee glide, same thing,
},
{
    443.14,446.64
     but with one knee, And he loved it.
},
{
    446.64,447.88
     So very good.
},
{
    447.88,450.0
     Again, five to 10 minutes, you'll know,
},
{
    450.0,451.16
     because you'll get tired.
},
{
    451.16,453.68
     And then you do that three times a day or so
},
{
    453.68,455.64
     with either one of those devices.
},
{
    455.64,457.96
     All right, next thing you can do.
},
{
    457.96,462.32
     Now this is something I'm gonna throw at you, but with...
},
{
    462.32,464.52
     You probably wanna talk to your doctor about this
},
{
    464.52,467.72
     and you might even be measured for compression socks.
},
{
    467.72,468.56
     Is that what you're gonna-
},
{
    468.56,469.52
     It's a compression sock.
},
{
    469.52,471.2
     There's a lot of different varieties,
},
{
    471.2,475.4
     but Bob says talk to your doctor first, get fitted.
},
{
    476.2,480.2
     It's helpful to have a little more compression
},
{
    480.2,483.08
     around the foot and ankle than up around by the knee.
},
{
    483.08,485.52
     That way it pushes the fluid upwards.
},
{
    485.52,488.0
     Yeah, a good compression sock will actually
},
{
    488.0,490.8
     kind of have a gradient, right?
},
{
    490.8,492.16
     Yeah, that's a good word for them.
},
{
    492.16,494.48
     Well, actually put a little more stress
},
{
    494.48,497.04
     and pressure down here and less as you go up.
},
{
    497.04,498.68
     Yeah, exactly.
},
{
    498.68,500.6
     That's why I don't like really Ted stockings
},
{
    500.6,502.64
     because they don't seem to be made that way.
},
{
    502.64,504.92
     They actually can cut off pressure here sometimes.
},
{
    504.92,505.92
     Yeah, yeah.
},
{
    505.92,510.0
     So again, compression stocks are an option,
},
{
    510.0,511.04
     but look into it first.
},
{
    511.04,513.2
     Sometimes a physical therapist is nice to work with.
},
{
    513.2,514.24
     Yeah, I didn't think about that.
},
{
    514.24,515.92
     They're very difficult to put on.
},
{
    515.92,516.76
     They can be.
},
{
    516.76,519.64
     Yeah, you gotta learn the right way to do it.
},
{
    519.64,521.12
     Now we're gonna go to standing, Bob.
},
{
    521.12,521.96
     Sure.
},
{
    521.96,524.42
     You got a job that you work at or at home.
},
{
    525.4,527.92
     The first thing you can do, I'm gonna go to standing, Bob. If you got a job that you work at or at home, the first thing you can do, I'm gonna,
},
{
    529.72,531.12
     get this out of the way.
},
{
    532.58,534.4
     Now have something to hold on to.
},
{
    534.4,537.2
     A chair, I'm gonna use a Boyastick for balance.
},
{
    537.2,540.48
     But I want you to do similar to ankle pumps,
},
{
    540.48,543.08
     but you're gonna go up on your toes
},
{
    543.08,544.6
     and then lift your toes up.
},
{
    544.6,546.8
     So rocking back and forth.
},
{
    546.8,547.96
     Make sure you have good balance.
},
{
    547.96,551.5
     Again, grab something solid, a countertop if you need to.
},
{
    551.5,554.48
     This, again, works circulation, works strength.
},
{
    554.48,556.1
     It's even good for your balance.
},
{
    556.1,560.44
     The next thing is you wanna stretch out your calf muscles.
},
{
    560.44,562.04
     You can lean up against the wall
},
{
    562.04,563.96
     and see how I'm stretching here.
},
{
    563.96,566.76
     Don't let your toe point out straight ahead and
},
{
    567.4,571.76
     Stretch you're gonna hold it five to 15 seconds. You can hold longer if you like
},
{
    572.24,574.24
     Make sure you do both feet
},
{
    574.44,576.32
     Feels good typically
},
{
    576.32,580.56
     Don't get too aggressive if you have not done these in the past hold for five seconds
},
{
    580.56,586.68
     And I don't want you to get sore the next morning. By, the way I want to mention too, on those toe-ups and heel-ups,
},
{
    586.68,589.44
     that's what's nice about those you can do all day long.
},
{
    589.44,590.28
     Sure.
},
{
    590.28,591.56
     I had a teacher, I think I practiced it before.
},
{
    591.56,593.52
     Well, not consistently.
},
{
    593.52,594.4
     You gotta take a break.
},
{
    594.4,595.24
     Wow, dope.
},
{
    595.24,597.08
     But she used to do it while she was teaching.
},
{
    597.08,598.32
     I still remember this so clearly.
},
{
    598.32,600.12
     She was my fifth grade teacher.
},
{
    600.12,602.24
     But she'd be doing these while she's,
},
{
    602.24,603.56
     you know, just standing there and teaching.
},
{
    603.56,605.36
     And she goes, my doctor told me
},
{
    605.36,606.92
     that I was supposed to do this.
},
{
    606.92,609.0
     That was like 700 years ago.
},
{
    609.0,609.84
     So.
},
{
    609.84,610.68
     So.
},
{
    610.68,611.6
     So.
},
{
    611.6,613.28
     Absolutely.
},
{
    613.28,615.18
     The other thing, if you are standing
},
{
    615.18,617.84
     and you have the opportunity to have a chair,
},
{
    617.84,620.84
     you can just simply do some sit to stand.
},
{
    620.84,622.64
     You know, do about five of these,
},
{
    622.64,624.52
     you know, 10 if you feel comfortable.
},
{
    624.52,626.08
     Again, acting like a pump.
},
{
    626.08,627.76
     It's moving the fluid up.
},
{
    627.76,632.0
     It's moving the fluid into the air where it can be processed.
},
{
    632.0,633.64
     Exactly, Bob.
},
{
    633.64,637.8
     Now, if you happen to be working at a countertop
},
{
    637.8,640.76
     or at your workplace where you're standing
},
{
    640.76,644.04
     while you're working, if you can manage it,
},
{
    644.04,646.24
     a stool like about this height,
},
{
    646.24,648.32
     you're working for about 20 minutes,
},
{
    648.32,649.92
     your leg pain is starting to, you know,
},
{
    649.92,653.2
     you can feel the swelling just to sit like this.
},
{
    653.2,655.08
     And you can work some ankle pumps,
},
{
    655.08,657.84
     sit for five minutes and stand.
},
{
    657.84,661.08
     And just working that as you can,
},
{
    661.08,663.2
     can be really helpful, particularly on the joints.
},
{
    663.2,664.44
     If your joints are painful,
},
{
    664.44,665.84
     can we grieve? Would you agree, Brad, though,
},
{
    665.84,668.4
     that you probably wouldn't recommend prolonged standing
},
{
    668.4,670.16
     if you have ankle swelling?
},
{
    670.16,672.0
     Well, I'm saying if the person is working.
},
{
    672.0,674.96
     Yeah, they're doing a job where they're forced to stand.
},
{
    674.96,678.6
     Because unfortunately, standing is probably gonna put
},
{
    678.6,681.08
     increased stress on your venous system.
},
{
    681.08,683.12
     And I mean, a lot of people,
},
{
    683.12,684.32
     that's where they get swelling is
},
{
    684.32,685.92
     because they prolonged stand. And so you of people, that's where they get swelling is because they prolong stand.
},
{
    685.92,688.28
     And so you're right, that's a great option.
},
{
    688.28,691.08
     You know, if your job entails standing,
},
{
    691.08,692.24
     try to see if something, you know,
},
{
    692.24,694.4
     your boss will let you use a stool
},
{
    694.4,696.68
     to at least sit down once while and get your feet up.
},
{
    696.68,697.96
     A little bit.
},
{
    697.96,701.2
     The other thing you can do at the same situation
},
{
    701.2,704.08
     is you can just shift your weight right to left.
},
{
    704.08,705.4
     Or if you have a short stool,
},
{
    705.4,707.32
     this is probably a little high.
},
{
    708.52,712.28
     If you can put your foot up and continue working
},
{
    712.28,714.0
     and just shift like this.
},
{
    714.0,715.28
     This is about eight inches high.
},
{
    715.28,718.56
     I'd recommend maybe four, maybe six inches,
},
{
    718.56,720.56
     a little bit lower.
},
{
    720.56,721.56
     What we always see people,
},
{
    721.56,723.6
     if they're washing dishes at the sink,
},
{
    723.6,725.48
     open up the cupboard below
},
{
    725.48,728.56
     and you can use that four inch step in there
},
{
    728.56,730.4
     for that same concept.
},
{
    730.4,733.64
     Out of these 10 ideas, you hopefully will find some
},
{
    733.64,734.48
     that work for you.
},
{
    734.48,737.12
     And you wanna see the proof, is it the pudding,
},
{
    737.12,737.96
     as they say?
},
{
    737.96,740.24
     You look down and you see it's just helping decrease
},
{
    740.24,741.48
     my swelling.
},
{
    741.48,743.24
     That's the ones you wanna keep doing.
},
{
    743.24,745.56
     And all of them probably are not going to eliminate
},
{
    745.56,747.24
     or decrease the swelling in one day.
},
{
    747.24,749.68
     You've got to work at this for a number of days
},
{
    749.68,751.08
     to see the progress.
},
{
    751.08,755.28
     Oh, Bob, we did say 10, we only did nine,
},
{
    755.28,759.0
     but for standing, this is a 10th one,
},
{
    759.0,760.6
     it's kind of a double, double dipper,
},
{
    760.6,764.16
     but you can also do compression garments as well.
},
{
    764.16,765.04
     I was standing, I thought you did, oh, I see you didn't do that number as well. I was standing.
},
{
    765.04,765.88
     I thought you did.
},
{
    765.88,766.84
     Oh, I see you did.
},
{
    766.84,767.88
     You didn't do that number 10.
},
{
    767.88,769.2
     Well, it goes on the sitting.
},
{
    769.2,770.04
     I understand.
},
{
    770.04,770.88
     I gotcha.
},
{
    770.88,773.28
     I know viewers are pretty sharp out there.
},
{
    773.28,774.12
     They count.
},
{
    774.12,774.96
     They're gonna count.
},
{
    774.96,775.8
     They would say,
},
{
    775.8,776.64
     you did nine, what happened to the 10th one?
},
{
    776.64,777.64
     Here's number 10.
},
{
    777.64,780.68
     Remember, Brad and I can fix this about anything.
},
{
    780.68,781.52
     Except for.
},
{
    781.52,782.36
     A broken heart.
},
{
    782.36,784.28
     But we're working on that as well.
},
{
    784.28,785.88
     All right, thanks for watching.
},
