     Welcome back everyone. Today I'm going to show you some stretches you can do for the
},
{
    5.6,10.8
     hamstrings that can allow you to reduce the stiffness and tightness in the hamstrings.
},
{
    10.8,14.56
     The hamstrings can cause a bit of pain in the lower back, in the hip, and even down into
},
{
    14.56,19.44
     the leg as well. So these stretches definitely help you for lower back pain and even knee
},
{
    19.44,28.16
     pain and hip pain. I hope these stretches help you as much as they help me and my patients.
},
{
    28.16,33.2
     Strap stretch. Sit on the floor with your legs in front of you, place a bout or a strap
},
{
    33.2,38.24
     around the ball of your foot. Now, as you lay back down, keep the tension of the strap
},
{
    38.24,43.16
     so you don't lose the placement on the ball of your foot. The ideal flexibility that most
},
{
    43.16,46.68
     people should aim for is to have about 90 degrees of hip
},
{
    46.68,49.48
     flexion with your legs straight.
},
{
    49.48,53.92
     If you can't pull your legs this far, just pull it to the point of stretch.
},
{
    53.92,57.76
     If you feel like your hamstrings are too tight, you can add a little bit of a bend in the
},
{
    57.76,58.76
     knee.
},
{
    58.76,63.12
     Don't force the stretch if you can't do it, otherwise you might hurt yourself.
},
{
    63.12,65.16
     Take a deep breath in and as
},
{
    65.16,71.34
     you exhale gently draw the leg towards your torso and hold in for an easy stretch
},
{
    71.34,78.04
     for 20 to 30 seconds. Hold this stretch at approximately 50 to 60% stretch
},
{
    78.04,83.4
     capacity. Now from this position push your foot against the belt or strap that
},
{
    83.4,88.08
     you're using as if you were trying to lower the leg towards the ground.
},
{
    88.08,90.4
     But resist this by holding tight to the strap
},
{
    90.4,91.92
     or belt that you're holding
},
{
    91.92,94.74
     and not allowing the leg to go anywhere.
},
{
    94.74,98.14
     This creates an isometric contraction in the hamstrings.
},
{
    98.14,100.86
     Hold this for about six to eight seconds
},
{
    100.86,106.6
     and apply about 30 to 40% of force against the strap. Once six to eight
},
{
    106.6,112.92
     seconds is over, take a deep breath in and as you exhale take the leg back into
},
{
    112.92,118.56
     stretch again and hold it for about 20 to 30 seconds. Then relax for 30 seconds
},
{
    118.56,128.88
     and repeat this five to six times on each leg. In this video your will increase, and if you weren't able to touch your toes,
},
{
    128.88,134.28
     I wouldn't be surprised if you were able to touch your toes after doing the PNF stretches
},
{
    134.28,136.04
     in this video.
},
{
    136.04,141.08
     If your goal was to be able to touch your toes, I highly recommend doing these PNF stretches
},
{
    141.08,144.44
     for at least 3 to 4 days a week.
},
{
    144.44,147.24
     Your resting range of motion will slowly increase
},
{
    147.24,149.44
     to the point that you'll be able to touch your toes
},
{
    149.44,151.02
     whenever you feel like it.
},
{
    151.02,152.92
     If you're really serious about this,
},
{
    152.92,155.66
     please do it three to four days a week
},
{
    155.66,157.92
     and do it for the next 12 weeks.
},
{
    157.92,161.16
     A research paper was published in 2014
},
{
    161.16,163.28
     on the different effects of PNF stretching
},
{
    163.28,165.8
     versus passive stretching. It was found that
},
{
    165.8,171.36
     rapid muscle activation capabilities were maintained if you did PNF stretching over
},
{
    171.36,177.2
     passive stretching, which is crucial to maintain dynamic joint stability.
},
{
    177.2,181.56
     Passive stretching is pretty much traditional stretching where you pretty much hold your
},
{
    181.56,186.2
     joints in the end ranges of motion and hold it for a certain amount of time.
},
{
    186.2,192.16
     However, if you suffer from poor joint stability or do a lot of agility training such as sports,
},
{
    192.16,195.28
     PNF stretching might be a lot more beneficial for you.
},
{
    195.28,198.02
     Standing hamstring stretches.
},
{
    198.02,203.2
     This is a great way you can still do the PNF stretches without getting onto the floor,
},
{
    203.2,205.04
     especially if you have trouble getting up
},
{
    205.04,206.68
     and down from the floor.
},
{
    206.68,213.0
     Just find a stool or chair that you can place your heel on it, whilst keeping your leg straight
},
{
    213.0,214.56
     and your knee extended.
},
{
    214.56,219.9
     To really target the hamstring muscles, please anteriorly tilt your hips by rotating your
},
{
    219.9,221.08
     hips forward.
},
{
    221.08,225.2
     This places your hamstrings in an elongated position by pulling the hamstrings
},
{
    225.2,230.8
     into a pre-stretched position. Now lean your body forward without hunching your back by
},
{
    230.8,236.32
     holding up your chest as much as possible. This will help target the hamstrings a lot
},
{
    236.32,241.94
     better. I like to gently rest my hands slightly above my knee to promote my leg to stay in
},
{
    241.94,245.34
     a straight position and my knee in extension. After
},
{
    245.34,250.42
     holding this stretch for about 20 to 30 seconds at approximately 50-60% capacity,
},
{
    250.42,255.14
     I want you to press your heel back onto the chair or bench for about 6 to 8
},
{
    255.14,261.62
     seconds and apply about 30 to 40% force against the chair or bench with your
},
{
    261.62,268.96
     heel. Once 6 to 8 seconds is over, you can go back to the point of stretch and hold it again
},
{
    268.96,274.8
     for about 20 to 30 seconds at about 50 to 60% capacity of stretch.
},
{
    274.8,279.44
     When you are doing this stretch, please keep your shoulders square on whilst facing the
},
{
    279.44,281.36
     leg that you're stretching.
},
{
    281.36,285.36
     Sometimes when the stretch is too intense, you may twist your body and
},
{
    285.36,288.88
     one of the shoulders will be closer to the leg that you're stretching compared to the
},
{
    288.88,295.52
     other. This will create an uneven stretch and you won't be getting a good stretch in
},
{
    295.52,301.48
     your hamstrings. Once you've done stretching on one leg, don't forget to repeat the process
},
{
    301.48,304.32
     5-6 times on each leg.
},

    304.32,306.32
