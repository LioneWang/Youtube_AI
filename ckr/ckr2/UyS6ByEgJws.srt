     Hello, my name's Daughter Gill. I've been asked to do some lung function testing on yourself
},
{
    16.4,19.36
     today, some spirometry. Have you had that done before?
},
{
    19.36,20.36
     I know.
},
{
    20.36,23.96
     Super. So before we start that, can I confirm your name and date of birth please?
},
{
    23.96,27.0
     Yeah, but I've been taughtth December 4th December 96th.
},
{
    27.0,34.0
     Super. So what long-function testing means is we're going to get you to use this device,
},
{
    34.0,39.0
     we're going to get you to take a full breath in all the way to the bottom of your lungs, as it were,
},
{
    39.0,45.68
     and then breathe out as hard and as fast as you can, and we're going to see how well your lungs are working. OK? Yeah.
},
{
    45.68,50.2
     So we need to cover a few safety questions before we can actually do the test.
},
{
    50.2,52.68
     Have you had a cough at the moment? No.
},
{
    52.68,55.24
     Have you had any recent chest infections? No.
},
{
    55.24,60.28
     OK. And have you ever had problems with your eyes and needed surgery on them?
},
{
    60.28,61.28
     No.
},
{
    61.28,64.52
     And have you had any chest or abdominal surgery? No.
},
{
    64.52,66.0

     less common ones? Have you ever had a blood clots at all? No. Okay and have you
},
{
    71.0,75.66
     ever had a lung collapse? No. Okay and just for the data I want to put it in do you
},
{
    75.66,80.76
     smoke at all? No. Super. Okay in that case we should be able to go ahead and do the
},
{
    80.76,85.74
     test. So we've got a brand new mouthpiece for yourself and what we need
},
{
    85.74,89.44
     to do first, we're just going to get you to step over to the side here and we're going
},
{
    89.44,94.6
     to check your vital statistics. So we're going to check your height and weight if you could.
},
{
    94.6,107.0
     So let's go this way. And then step onto the scales. Super. Okay, that's grand. And if we just move over to get your height.
},
{
    107.0,110.0
     So if you come back against here for me.
},
{
    111.0,113.0
     And then come away please.
},
{
    114.0,118.0
     OK, so we'll call that 166 bang on.
},
{
    119.0,121.0
     Right, we've got those.
},
{
    121.0,124.0
     So let's put that into the system for you.
},
{
    124.0,128.0
     So we load up for the spirometry, which is what we're testing.
},
{
    128.4,133.8
     And your female, your Caucasian, we've got your height as 166.
},
{
    134.24,136.88
     And we have your weight as 81 kilos.
},
{
    137.28,140.2
     And your age, as we know, is 24. Perfect.
},
{
    140.48,142.08
     That's all set.
},
{
    142.08,145.04
     Now, in terms of doing the test, I'm going to have to ask you to wear
},
{
    145.04,149.4
     this nose peg so that the air is only coming out of your mouth. So I'll ask
},
{
    149.4,155.04
     you to put that on in a moment. We've got a brand new mouthpiece for you with
},
{
    155.04,160.12
     new bacterial seal and we're going to put that in there. When you do take this
},
{
    160.12,165.52
     I want you to hold it in your hands like so, sitting up nice and straight with your legs
},
{
    165.52,171.88
     uncrossed and it's full breath all the way in, all the way out of your lungs and we'll
},
{
    171.88,176.4
     follow the graph as we're doing it. We're going to do that three times to make sure
},
{
    176.4,193.08
     that everything, we get the correct data. Okay, so if I give you that And put those piece on excellent and then sit up nice and straight deep breath in and harden fast as you can
},
{
    196.32,202.52
     That was excellent, okay, so we're going to do the best of three so if you can do the same again, please
},
{
    213.52,225.0
     best of three so if you can do the same again please. Excellent. Okay and the final one for our three. Okay that was the best of all three, terrific.
},
{
    226.32,229.52
     So, if we take that from you, okay,
},
{
    229.52,233.8
     and we'll get you to bin that shortly.
},
{
    233.8,237.32
     So put that there, take this over to the side.
},
{
    238.28,242.08
     Right, so let's have a look at those results.
},
{
    242.08,247.0
     So we can see here your FEV1 is 14% higher than normal so
},
{
    247.0,253.08
     that's how much you can breathe out in one second. We've got your FEVC so that's
},
{
    253.08,259.08
     a 4% more than normal so that's how much air you can hold and this is able to
},
{
    259.08,264.36
     calculate your lung age that's under 25 which the machine is agreeing with. We've
},
{
    264.36,265.92
     got normal spirometry.
},
{
    265.92,268.96
     You've done a good blow and the BTS criteria.
},
{
    268.96,272.72
     So some of the respiratory specialists have this criteria.
},
{
    272.72,275.28
     That's all normal and is excellent.
},
{
    275.28,277.32
     So we've given you a clean bill of health
},
{
    277.32,279.48
     with regard to your lungs.
},
{
    279.48,281.24
     Do you have any questions for me at the moment?
},
{
    281.24,282.08
     No.
},
{
    282.08,287.0
