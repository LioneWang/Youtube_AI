     Jared Bechstrand here, doctor of physical therapy at tonentighting.com.
},
{
    5.6,9.24
     And today I wanted to talk all about muscle knots in your lower back, specifically what
},
{
    9.24,14.12
     they are, why you get them, and about 10 simple exercises that you can do right now at home
},
{
    14.12,15.68
     to help eliminate yours.
},
{
    15.68,23.36
     Let's get started right now.
},
{
    23.36,27.2
     All right, so one of my more popular videos here on YouTube is all about how to get rid
},
{
    27.2,30.84
     of muscle knots in your neck and shoulders and upper back.
},
{
    30.84,33.96
     I'm going to leave a link to this in the description to this video.
},
{
    33.96,36.36
     I'll also drop in a little tag right up here above.
},
{
    36.36,40.44
     You can click that link that's floating around up there, and that will take you to that video.
},
{
    40.44,42.76
     That's again, probably one of my more popular ones.
},
{
    42.76,48.08
     However, one of the questions that I'm getting a lot in the comments to that video are, well,
},
{
    48.08,49.08
     this is great for the upper back.
},
{
    49.08,50.56
     What do I do about my lower back?
},
{
    50.56,54.08
     And if my lower back has these muscle knots in it, what are some things that I can do
},
{
    54.08,57.96
     to eliminate tension and to eliminate knots in my lower back?
},
{
    57.96,58.96
     And here you go, you guys.
},
{
    58.96,61.24
     I'm all about helping you guys out.
},
{
    61.24,64.76
     Let me shoot a quick video about that and show you some things that I like to recommend
},
{
    64.76,68.96
     to patients in order to eliminate these muscle knots in kind of your lower back and in the
},
{
    68.96,73.2
     top of your hip. Now of course before we do that I've got to give you the anatomy lesson and I've
},
{
    73.2,78.64
     got to give you the physiology lesson. So what is a muscle knot? So the muscles in our bodies,
},
{
    78.64,83.84
     the fibers in those muscles are lined up like this and in the relaxed state they're nice and
},
{
    83.84,86.3
     elongated and nice and loose like this.
},
{
    86.3,89.02
     In the contracted state, they slide over each other
},
{
    89.02,91.06
     and they come closer together just like this.
},
{
    91.06,92.92
     So relaxed and contracted.
},
{
    92.92,96.64
     What a muscle knot is, it's an area of a muscle,
},
{
    96.64,98.46
     so certain fibers in that muscle
},
{
    98.46,100.12
     that get into this contracted state
},
{
    100.12,101.4
     and then don't let go.
},
{
    101.4,106.84
     And so they stay in this constant contracted state without that relaxation.
},
{
    106.84,107.96
     That's what causes that tension.
},
{
    107.96,109.44
     That's what causes that pain.
},
{
    109.44,111.42
     You can actually feel it in your back.
},
{
    111.42,113.68
     If you've kind of, you know, feel around in your lower back.
},
{
    113.68,118.92
     If you've got one area that feels tighter than the others, that's most likely a muscle
},
{
    118.92,120.92
     knot that you've got going on back there.
},
{
    120.92,123.28
     There are some things that you can do to get rid of it.
},
{
    123.28,128.72
     That's what I want to teach you about right now. Before we do that, however, let's talk a little bit more about why these muscle
},
{
    128.72,133.2
     knots occur, why you get these muscle knots, so that we can better understand how we treat them.
},
{
    133.2,137.36
     The three main causes that I see why people develop these muscle knots in their lower back
},
{
    137.36,143.28
     are going to be weakness, lack of activity, or like a sedentary lifestyle, and then some postural
},
{
    143.28,145.48
     issues as well. Now weakness,
},
{
    145.48,149.66
     we all know how important it is to keep a nice strong core. If your core is not
},
{
    149.66,153.98
     strong and if you develop weakness over time, that's one of those predisposing
},
{
    153.98,158.2
     factors to causing those muscle knots to get tight and then to not let go. And so
},
{
    158.2,161.18
     weakness is a big thing. We're going to show you some strengthening exercises in
},
{
    161.18,168.72
     this video. The second one is a lack of activity or a sedentary lifestyle. Your muscles are designed to move. Your muscles are
},
{
    168.72,172.96
     designed to contract and relax. If you spend all day maybe sitting at a desk,
},
{
    172.96,176.72
     sitting on your couch, laying in your bed, whatever you're doing, if you don't live
},
{
    176.72,180.76
     a very active lifestyle, you're not getting that muscle contraction in those
},
{
    180.76,184.72
     areas and then that can be another reason why those muscles get tight and
},
{
    184.72,188.72
     bound up. So definitely a lack of activity is another one. Finally,
},
{
    188.72,192.8
     posture is a big issue as well. Specifically what I call a desk job
},
{
    192.8,197.44
     posture. So if you spend all day seated and especially if your hip flexors are
},
{
    197.44,201.4
     in this shortened state and then you stand up and they pull excessively on
},
{
    201.4,205.14
     your lower back, that can be another big predisposing factor
},
{
    205.14,206.6
     for these muscle knots.
},
{
    206.6,209.52
     And so those are the three things that we certainly want to address.
},
{
    209.52,211.76
     We're going to do those with a bunch of exercises.
},
{
    211.76,215.44
     I'm going to go grab my wife, we'll bring her in and we'll demonstrate again about
},
{
    215.44,219.72
     10 different ways that you can help to alleviate some of these muscle knots and this muscle
},
{
    219.72,221.48
     tension in your lower back.
},
{
    221.48,224.48
     All right, so I brought in my lovely assistant.
},
{
    224.48,225.88
     You guys are used to seeing my wife.
},
{
    225.88,228.08
     She pops up in my videos quite regularly.
},
{
    228.08,232.08
     But we're going to run through, again, about 10 different ways that you can treat those
},
{
    232.08,234.24
     muscle knots that you're getting in your lower back.
},
{
    234.24,239.24
     Now, the first thing that I always recommend to people is just some heat on that area.
},
{
    239.24,244.04
     So if you grab a heating pad, and what I'll do is I've got a couple favorites that I like.
},
{
    244.04,248.16
     I'll leave a link in the description to this video you click on that if you don't have a heating pad
},
{
    248.8,252.4
     Between the two of us. We use ours like almost every day
},
{
    253.16,258.2
     They're great. It's a great way to open up capillaries to promote blood flow into an area
},
{
    258.36,264.16
     Also to promote some relaxation in those knots and so a heating pad and so I would just put that down
},
{
    264.16,268.6
     She would lay on it on her back. We use it in our chairs, like sitting up in your chair.
},
{
    268.6,273.0
     It works well right there. Leave it on for about 10 or 15 minutes. Take it off
},
{
    273.0,276.64
     for about 10 or 15 minutes, and then you can really do that all day long. So a
},
{
    276.64,281.12
     heating pad is the first thing that you're going to reach for. Now the second
},
{
    281.12,284.4
     thing that we need to do is stretch out some of those tight muscles. So what
},
{
    284.4,287.32
     Camille's going to do is get down up here on her hands and knees.
},
{
    287.32,290.88
     We're going to show you my favorite, it's a popular yoga pose to stretch your lower
},
{
    290.88,293.02
     back, it's called the child's pose.
},
{
    293.02,297.36
     And so she's down on her knees and basically you sit down on your heels, your hands stay
},
{
    297.36,301.72
     out here in front of you and that's how you're going to stretch out that lower back.
},
{
    301.72,306.72
     Now the thing that I like about this is you can actually bias it from one side to another,
},
{
    306.72,309.36
     depending on maybe which side your muscle knots are.
},
{
    309.36,312.24
     She's gonna walk her hands over here to the right side,
},
{
    312.24,314.64
     and then if she kinda sits down and to the left,
},
{
    314.64,317.6
     what that's going to do is increase the stretch
},
{
    317.6,320.76
     on the lower left side of her back down here.
},
{
    320.76,323.58
     So you can really kinda facilitate that stretch.
},
{
    323.58,327.36
     A lot of these muscles that you're gonna to get knots in, basically from your pelvis
},
{
    327.36,331.96
     to your bottom rib with some attachment in your lower spine, in your lumbar spine, your
},
{
    331.96,336.04
     lower back right here, anything we can do to kind of pull the pelvis away from the rib
},
{
    336.04,338.72
     is actually going to stretch that out a little more effectively.
},
{
    338.72,340.54
     So that's her over here to the right side.
},
{
    340.54,342.5
     She can also walk over to the left side.
},
{
    342.5,347.76
     That's going to facilitate and enhance that stretch over here on the right. She's going to hold that for about 20 seconds
},
{
    347.76,351.6
     and repeat that about three times. The other stretch that I love, Camille's going to roll
},
{
    351.6,357.22
     over onto her back and we're going to do what we call a piriformis stretch. Now, 10 low
},
{
    357.22,361.12
     back pain patients can walk into my clinic and I guarantee about nine of them are going
},
{
    361.12,365.48
     to have tension through that upper hip, kind of that piriformis area.
},
{
    365.48,369.76
     It's a popular place to get knots in your back or in the back of your hip.
},
{
    369.76,373.72
     To stretch that out, what she's going to do is cross this right leg over her left with
},
{
    373.72,374.72
     her hand.
},
{
    374.72,377.48
     She's going to reach down and she's going to grab right around the back of that left
},
{
    377.48,381.52
     leg and then pull her left knee up towards her left shoulder.
},
{
    381.52,385.84
     Now the higher she pulls on that, she's going gonna fill that stretch, correct me if I'm wrong,
},
{
    385.84,387.4
     right through the top,
},
{
    387.4,389.28
     right through the top of that right glute
},
{
    389.28,390.48
     is what we're going for.
},
{
    390.48,391.32
     That's a good one.
},
{
    391.32,393.64
     And so we're gonna hold that in a comfortable position,
},
{
    393.64,396.04
     same thing, 20 seconds, three times,
},
{
    396.04,398.28
     to just try to promote some relaxation
},
{
    398.28,400.04
     in those muscle fibers in there.
},
{
    400.04,401.76
     So those are the stretches that I like.
},
{
    401.76,402.6
     She's gonna do it on the other side.
},
{
    402.6,404.24
     I gotta even it out.
},
{
    404.24,405.72
     She doesn't walk around in circles. She's gonna do it on the other side. I gotta even it out. She doesn't walk around in circles.
},
{
    405.72,407.52
     She's gotta even it out.
},
{
    407.52,408.36
     Awesome.
},
{
    408.36,411.32
     So then let's get into some actual resisted exercises.
},
{
    411.32,412.76
     We mentioned how, oh, let's go ahead and stay there.
},
{
    412.76,413.68
     I'm sorry.
},
{
    413.68,416.48
     We mentioned how the weakness
},
{
    416.48,418.24
     and the lack of muscle activation
},
{
    418.24,420.44
     are a couple of factors that can predispose you
},
{
    420.44,421.8
     to get these muscle knots.
},
{
    421.8,423.96
     And so let's show you some resisted exercises.
},
{
    423.96,427.0
     We'll even just some body weight exercises to help those out.
},
{
    427.0,430.0
     So on her back, just like this, what Camille's going to do first
},
{
    430.0,431.0
     is we're going to do some bridges.
},
{
    431.0,434.0
     She's going to squeeze her butt together, so contract the glutes,
},
{
    434.0,437.0
     and then lift your hips straight up towards the ceiling.
},
{
    437.0,439.0
     And so then it looks just like that.
},
{
    439.0,441.0
     She's going to hold that for about three to five seconds,
},
{
    441.0,443.0
     and then come right back down.
},
{
    443.0,446.72
     Now the emphasis here, you really want to focus on contracting your glutes to lift your
},
{
    446.72,450.4
     hips up towards the ceiling but you're also going to feel a lot of activation
},
{
    450.4,455.12
     in those lower back muscles. This one is safe for I'd say most people go ahead and
},
{
    455.12,458.52
     come back down. Most people who are experienced low back pain can tolerate
},
{
    458.52,462.2
     this exercise. This is a popular one that I give out. It's just a great way to
},
{
    462.2,467.92
     strengthen what we call the posterior chain, meaning your hamstrings, your glutes, and your lower back, go ahead and come up
},
{
    467.92,472.92
     again, are all active as she's doing this bridging exercise. Typically I'll recommend
},
{
    472.92,479.64
     do that 10 reps and then repeat that for three sets, just once a day on that one should be
},
{
    479.64,483.4
     adequate for you. The other one that I like, go ahead, she's going to roll over onto her
},
{
    483.4,489.7
     hands and knees, and we're going to run through what we call a cat cow or a cat camel. I make a
},
{
    489.7,494.94
     point, I try not to say cat cow, I don't know, there's something about it that sounds
},
{
    494.94,500.16
     offensive to me. Anyway, we're going to go with a cat camel, sometimes referred to as
},
{
    500.16,504.96
     a cat cow. This is another great yoga pose to just work on stretching and some muscle
},
{
    504.96,509.64
     activation in this lower part of her back. So to get into the angry cat part of the stretch,
},
{
    509.64,514.64
     she's going to basically raise her back up towards the ceiling as high as she can go.
},
{
    514.64,518.08
     Looks just like that. Hold that for about five seconds and then she's going to lower
},
{
    518.08,524.12
     back down and this is the cow or the camel part of the pose right here. Now Camille
},
{
    524.12,529.06
     and I have worked enough on this that she does it actually really well. The thing that I see the most
},
{
    529.06,533.32
     often in people is that you get a ton of mobility up here but not a ton of
},
{
    533.32,536.72
     mobility down through here. This is the area that I really want you to focus on.
},
{
    536.72,540.28
     So she comes back up into that angry cat. What you're gonna see is she's actually
},
{
    540.28,544.32
     gonna tuck her hips kind of underneath herself. She's gonna roll her pelvis
},
{
    544.32,547.24
     underneath herself to really get a good stretch through
},
{
    547.24,548.24
     the back.
},
{
    548.24,551.6
     And then as she comes down into the cow part of the pose, she's actually going to roll
},
{
    551.6,553.72
     her hips, roll her pelvis forward.
},
{
    553.72,557.56
     You can see how much that's really going to enhance that stretch and facilitate that
},
{
    557.56,560.6
     motion right through that lower back part right there.
},
{
    560.6,562.52
     And so I tell people about 10 reps on this.
},
{
    562.52,564.92
     So you're going to come up and down 10 times.
},
{
    564.92,566.48
     And then that's usually good. So about 10 times on this so you're gonna come up and down 10 times and then that's that's usually good
},
{
    566.48,570.26
     So about 10 times just once a day on that one looks great just like that
},
{
    570.26,572.26
     I might not get hurt
},
{
    572.58,576.94
     Nice okay, and so those are the stretches and the exercises that I like
},
{
    576.94,582.52
     Let me show you guys some trigger point release techniques that I like we're gonna get rid of this table coming right at you right now
},
{
    583.94,584.62
     All right
},
{
    584.62,587.56
     So another great way that you're to eliminate these muscle knots in your lower
},
{
    587.56,592.72
     back would be to do some actual what we call trigger point release techniques.
},
{
    592.72,595.76
     Basically it's also called an acupressure technique.
},
{
    595.76,600.56
     You find that knot, you load it up with pressure, you hold it for a certain amount of time and
},
{
    600.56,608.28
     what happens is that muscle knot kind of melts underneath that tension or underneath that pressure. Basically what you're doing is you're starting that
},
{
    608.28,614.2
     area of blood flow causing it to relax and to reset if you will and then when
},
{
    614.2,618.04
     you release it blood rushes back in and hopefully what you've done is again help
},
{
    618.04,621.96
     that area to reset. And so what we're going to do is we've got some tennis
},
{
    621.96,624.76
     balls here. Well I've got a couple I've got some tennis balls and I've got some
},
{
    624.76,625.2
     golf balls. Camille's going to lay down we've got some tennis balls here. Well, I've got a couple. I've got some tennis balls and I've got some golf balls.
},
{
    625.2,631.16
     Camille's going to lay down on her lower back and then what she would do, if you just
},
{
    631.16,637.32
     have that knot on one side of your back, let's say it's on the right side of her back, she's
},
{
    637.32,642.84
     going to take this tennis ball, roll slightly to her left and then find where that spot
},
{
    642.84,646.12
     is in her lower back and then just roll right
},
{
    646.12,650.0
     back onto the top of it. And again you might have to adjust it up or down,
},
{
    650.0,655.12
     in or out. It shouldn't be right on your spine, it should be just to the side of
},
{
    655.12,659.04
     your spine of your vertebrae column and then you'll be able to find some of those
},
{
    659.04,663.2
     muscle knots in there. And then what she can do is she can just lay right on that.
},
{
    663.2,669.52
     Now if a tennis ball is too big, or a racket ball or a golf ball works well, golf ball is
},
{
    669.52,674.22
     obviously a lot harder. There's not as much forgiveness with a golf ball, but I
},
{
    674.22,679.02
     wouldn't go necessarily too much bigger than this. The other technique that I like
},
{
    679.02,688.0
     to show people is if you get these muscle knots on both sides of your spine, you can actually grab two tennis balls, stuff them in a sock,
},
{
    691.0,695.0
     and now all the sock does is just kind of hold them in place and keep them together
},
{
    695.0,697.0
     so you can roll onto it a little easier.
},
{
    697.0,700.0
     So you can see that depending on how big your spine is
},
{
    700.0,703.0
     or how wide you want those tennis balls to be,
},
{
    703.0,705.92
     you can kind of pull them apart or put them closer together.
},
{
    705.92,711.56
     So now she can take that, put one of those balls on each side of her spine, and then
},
{
    711.56,715.96
     you're actually performing this acupressure technique on both sides.
},
{
    715.96,717.84
     And now it's going to be uncomfortable.
},
{
    717.84,722.36
     That's not the most comfortable thing in the world to lay on those balls.
},
{
    722.36,725.36
     But what you do is, again again about 20 to 30 seconds or
},
{
    725.36,729.98
     just until you feel that not kind of melting away, that's about the recommended amount
},
{
    729.98,731.88
     of time on there.
},
{
    731.88,734.16
     The last thing that you can do, are you doing okay?
},
{
    734.16,735.16
     Is that right?
},
{
    735.16,736.16
     Lay on those.
},
{
    736.16,741.2
     The last thing you can do is actually promote what we would call a muscle flossing while
},
{
    741.2,743.2
     you're doing that acupressure.
},
{
    743.2,748.08
     And so what she's going to do is lay one leg down straight and then simply what you have
},
{
    748.08,752.88
     to do is raise this knee all the way up and then all the way down.
},
{
    752.88,757.88
     And now what we're doing here, and she can even facilitate that by grabbing it.
},
{
    757.88,763.36
     So she's going to bring it up and then pull and then release and then bring it up and
},
{
    763.36,765.24
     then pull and then release. And then bring it up and then pull and then release.
},
{
    765.24,769.92
     And what we're doing there is we're actually promoting some motion in that muscle while
},
{
    769.92,772.24
     we've got that pressure on there.
},
{
    772.24,775.48
     It's just a way that we can actually facilitate that release.
},
{
    775.48,777.2
     What do you think?
},
{
    777.2,778.2
     She hates that one.
},
{
    778.2,779.2
     That's a good one.
},
{
    779.2,780.2
     That's a really good one.
},
{
    780.2,782.0
     It's one who gets muscle knots.
},
{
    782.0,783.6
     You can go ahead and bail off of there.
},
{
    783.6,786.48
     Now what I never recommend to people,
},
{
    786.48,789.4
     what I see a lot, especially here on YouTube,
},
{
    789.4,791.52
     people will grab their foam roller
},
{
    791.52,793.76
     and say you've got to foam roll your low back
},
{
    793.76,795.52
     to release those muscle knots.
},
{
    795.52,798.68
     Now, I really don't like that.
},
{
    798.68,801.3
     I think the foam roller is great for your upper back,
},
{
    801.3,804.3
     but for your lower back, it's just too big.
},
{
    804.3,805.84
     This is a six inch foam roller and you can lower back, it's just too big. This is a six-inch foam roller,
},
{
    805.84,811.04
     and you can see the diameter on this is really big. We've got to get pressure basically between
},
{
    811.04,818.4
     your ribs and your pelvis. That's not really a lot of space. This is too big to fit into that space.
},
{
    818.4,823.92
     The other thing, go ahead and try this out. The other thing, if she were to foam roll her lower
},
{
    823.92,825.4
     back, there's just A, there's no comfortable way to do it, but you to foam roll her lower back. There's just a
},
{
    825.4,829.48
     there's no comfortable way to do it but you can see what she's doing. She's
},
{
    829.48,834.64
     doing ab crunch while we're doing it. The idea is to relax and mobilize. You're
},
{
    834.64,840.4
     good. The idea is to relax and mobilize not to sustain an aggressive contraction
},
{
    840.4,847.2
     while you're on a foam roll. And so if it's me, I don't like to foam roll the lower back.
},
{
    847.2,851.4
     Now one thing that I do like to foam roll is going to be kind of the top of the hip,
},
{
    851.4,853.56
     top of the glute and the piriformis muscle.
},
{
    853.56,857.12
     To do that, she's going to go ahead and sit up right onto that foam roll.
},
{
    857.12,859.86
     She's going to cross one leg over the other.
},
{
    859.86,864.24
     And then if she rolls kind of to that right side, put your hands back behind it.
},
{
    864.24,871.04
     There it is and then we can roll up and down over the top of that piriformis muscle that way again a popular
},
{
    871.48,876.64
     Popular a common place to get muscle knots is in the top of the hip the top of that glute
},
{
    876.64,883.04
     This is a great way that you can mobilize and and kind of get to those muscle knots in those areas
},
{
    883.28,886.0
     Just like that. So don't foam roll your lower back,
},
{
    886.0,888.32
     but definitely foam roll your upper glute
},
{
    888.32,889.68
     and your piriformis.
},
{
    889.68,891.44
     Finally, the last thing that I like
},
{
    891.44,893.56
     is going to be one of these theracanes.
},
{
    893.56,895.64
     Now, again, I mentioned to you earlier
},
{
    895.64,898.12
     that I did another video that was all about
},
{
    898.12,900.58
     muscle knots in the neck and upper back.
},
{
    900.58,903.2
     We kind of introduced the theracane in that spot.
},
{
    903.2,907.84
     It's a great way that you can just kind of apply that pressure to that spot in
},
{
    907.84,912.2
     your back. But then with this, you can also do it so you can turn it this way.
},
{
    912.4,915.2
     And then you can do it with your lower back as well.
},
{
    915.4,919.36
     And so she's going to just grab both handles on that theracane and find the
},
{
    919.36,923.28
     spot that she wants to massage and mobilize in there. So a pressure point.
},
{
    923.28,930.36
     So then as soon as she finds that trigger point, you would just hold it on that spot to again apply that acupressure
},
{
    930.36,935.92
     into those areas until you get those muscle knots to release. Now again, these Theracanes,
},
{
    935.92,939.28
     this is another one. I had to go get this from our office upstairs just because that's
},
{
    939.28,945.56
     where it's always at. I will leave a link in the description to this video for the
},
{
    945.56,948.72
     theracane as well. That's another thing that will really help you guys out. And
},
{
    948.72,953.6
     so then finally the thing that we talked about was going to be some posture
},
{
    953.6,957.84
     and some posture issues. What I would recommend there and one more link for you.
},
{
    957.84,961.84
     I'll leave a link in this video. I'll also have it pop up right up here. I've
},
{
    961.84,966.96
     got a video all about how to correct your low back posture.
},
{
    966.96,969.84
     It's got some good exercises, it's got some good stretches.
},
{
    969.84,973.72
     So make sure that you go and check that one out.
},
{
    973.72,974.72
     That will be easier.
},
{
    974.72,976.04
     I know this video is getting long.
},
{
    976.04,977.04
     That will be easier.
},
{
    977.04,978.64
     So just go and check that video out.
},
{
    978.64,979.64
     It does a much better job.
},
{
    979.64,982.12
     It goes into a lot more detail than I want to go into right here.
},
{
    982.12,984.0
     So I hope you guys check that out.
},
{
    984.0,985.12
     So there you have them, you guys,
},
{
    985.12,988.68
     about what, 10 to 12 different things that you can do
},
{
    988.68,990.94
     to help eliminate some of the muscle knots
},
{
    990.94,993.76
     and some of the pressure that you feel in your lower back.
},
{
    993.76,996.24
     Again, I give those to my patients all the time.
},
{
    996.24,997.96
     I give those to my wife all the time.
},
{
    997.96,1000.16
     I do them on myself all the time.
},
{
    1000.16,1001.16
     They work, you guys.
},
{
    1001.16,1002.28
     They help your back.
},
{
    1002.28,1004.08
     They're maybe a little uncomfortable at first.
},
{
    1004.08,1007.08
     But consistency over time yields great results. And so I hope you guys. They help your back. They're maybe a little uncomfortable at first, but consistency over time yields great results.
},
{
    1007.08,1011.88
