     I'm going to talk now about what causes numb big toes and what you can do about it.
},
{
    4.52,7.88
     So when we talk about numb big toes, we have a lot of patients that come in, we have plenty
},
{
    7.88,12.2
     of numbness along the side of their toes, sometimes tingling and sometimes pain.
},
{
    12.2,16.84
     There's a very specific reason why this occurs and it's usually very easy to treat.
},
{
    16.84,21.08
     And by the way, this is the same thing that causes calluses on the side of the toe.
},
{
    21.08,25.52
     So if you look at a normal human step, most of us are going to hit on the outside of
},
{
    25.52,30.0
     our heel, we're going to roll in and we're going to go forward and the big toe joint is going to bend.
},
{
    30.72,36.8
     From the side it's going to look like this. All right, so that's a normal step. Now some people
},
{
    36.8,44.24
     when they walk their foot rolls in this way too much and so as it rolls in the ground presses up
},
{
    44.24,46.0
     under the big toe joint here.
},
{
    46.0,50.48
     And so now when they try and walk forward, that toe joint doesn't bend. And you can try that on
},
{
    50.48,56.0
     yourself. Just have, take your shoe off, sit down, have somebody push up under this area here,
},
{
    56.0,61.76
     and try and bend the big toe that won't bend. So if you can't bend this big toe, your body still
},
{
    61.76,69.2
     has to find some way to move forward. And the way it does it is instead of bending that toe fully, you end up, let me show you with
},
{
    69.2,73.72
     this foot, instead of bending forward like that, you end up rolling right off the side
},
{
    73.72,74.72
     of the toe.
},
{
    74.72,79.96
     What that does is it pinches this skin here, can cause what are called pinch calluses, and
},
{
    79.96,84.76
     in addition it can compress the nerves that run right underneath this area, and that's
},
{
    84.76,86.76
     actually what causes that numbness.
},
{
    86.76,92.12
     So when we try and treat this problem, our goal is to go back and get this toe to work
},
{
    92.12,94.8
     through a full range of motion when you walk forward.
},
{
    94.8,98.36
     If we can do that, we can almost always get rid of those symptoms.
},
{
    98.36,102.64
     The most effective way to do that is use shoes that are stable enough to stop your heel from
},
{
    102.64,107.64
     rolling in, and you can go to our website and get our shoe list to find those shoes.
},
{
    107.64,113.04
     And the second is to put some sort of orthotic inside your shoe that encourages this bone
},
{
    113.04,117.2
     to go down so that when you walk forward you have full range of motion in that joint.
},
{
    117.2,122.16
     Now the best orthotics that do that are what are custom orthotics that can form extremely
},
{
    122.16,123.52
     tight to the arch of the foot.
},
{
    123.52,126.26
     And those can be full sizedsized orthotics like this,
},
{
    126.26,129.22
     or women's small dress orthotics like this,
},
{
    129.22,131.5
     if in a dress shoes, flats, and heels.
},
{
    131.5,135.1
     But that really needs to grab that arch very, very tight
},
{
    135.1,136.7
     when the foot's in that position.
},
{
    136.7,138.1
     That works the best.
},
{
    138.1,140.58
     In addition, there are some over-the-counter devices
},
{
    140.58,141.42
     you can use.
},
{
    141.42,142.74
     They don't work quite as well,
},
{
    142.74,144.62
     but here's a good over-the-counter orthotic.
},
{
    144.62,147.72
     And see, the arch isn't quite as high, so the foot's still going to flatten
},
{
    147.72,151.68
     a little bit and that's going to jamming that joint, but it's still better than your
},
{
    151.68,155.84
     shoe alone. So again, on our website, if you go to the website and do a search for numb
},
{
    155.84,161.28
     toes or big toe numbness, you'll find some suggestions on some over-the-counter devices
},
{
    161.28,167.8
     and some more information on the custom orthotics that can help this problem. So this is an easy problem to treat. Don't live with it.
},
{
    167.8,171.64
     Again, it's caused by jamming of that big toe joint and you can always treat it
},
{
    171.64,173.72
     with the right device inside your shoe.
},
