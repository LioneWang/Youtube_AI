     Hi, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.
},
{
    3.44,4.44
     Brad Heineck, physical therapist.
},
{
    4.44,7.0
     Together we are the most famous physical therapists on the internet.
},
{
    7.0,8.76
     Well, in our opinion, of course, Bob.
},
{
    8.76,14.76
     Today, Brad, we just did a video on the top three signs that you may have Osgood-Slautern
},
{
    14.76,16.76
     disease or syndrome.
},
{
    16.76,20.36
     If you do, now you've come here because we had it at the end of that video to the top
},
{
    20.36,22.28
     three treatments for Osgood-Slautern.
},
{
    22.28,23.28
     Sure.
},
{
    23.28,27.62
     Now, the thing is, you want to remember about this, you're really not able to treat it to the
},
{
    27.62,31.52
     point where you can make it go away. This is what it's called a self-limiting
},
{
    31.52,36.96
     disease which means it's going to keep going on until your growth plates fuse
},
{
    36.96,41.36
     so it's going to keep going as long as you're growing and once it stops
},
{
    41.36,46.08
     the pain will stop. Sure, you think I could just interrupt Bob? Sure. Yeah. Well
},
{
    46.48,55.6
     Just so you understand that is what's happening. Your bones are growing rapidly and your muscles and this tape represents your quadriceps muscles
},
{
    55.6,57.6
     Which connect to your
},
{
    58.0,63.64
     Patellar or kneecap which end up connecting to your tibia, but the bones are growing
},
{
    65.8,69.84
     up connecting to your tibia, but the bones are growing and if this is your muscle it's going to grow in and starts to stretch the muscles so that all the
},
{
    69.84,74.92
     stress ends up down there on that knee. So the thing to do is we want to stretch
},
{
    74.92,80.44
     these muscles and strengthen these muscles so that mostly stretch them, we have
},
{
    80.44,83.96
     strength too, but so we get slack on there, take some of the pressure off that
},
{
    83.96,85.04
     point of injury and
},
{
    85.04,90.72
     Strengthening is important too because the muscles not keeping up with the bone and it's having to move a larger leather
},
{
    90.96,95.72
     than it did before so so these are the three things and that's good that you explain that Brad because
},
{
    96.52,103.28
     You have to understand this on and why we're doing the treatments that we're doing right so and then when you quit growing
},
{
    103.28,107.12
     Well, then the muscles will catch up muscles to catch catch up and strengthen. And then you're fine.
},
{
    107.12,111.42
     Yeah and then you're fine. So again we're trying to teach you how to cope with it
},
{
    111.42,115.72
     basically, there's no quick fix, you're just gonna grow it eventually. So the first
},
{
    115.72,120.6
     thing we suggest is that actually before you do an event or before the practice I
},
{
    120.6,124.92
     would actually do some massage on the tendon itself and I don't see anybody
},
{
    124.92,129.28
     else is recommending this but I highly recommend it for this reason.
},
{
    129.28,133.52
     And by the way, here's the kneecap, and right below is the tendon.
},
{
    133.52,137.0
     So here's your kneecap, right here is the tendon.
},
{
    137.0,141.52
     And you just take one finger and put it on top of the other and rub across it like this,
},
{
    141.52,143.32
     really hard.
},
{
    143.32,145.16
     And now if you're having pain there by the way
},
{
    145.16,149.68
     maybe you don't have Oshgud Slaughter. Oshgud Slaughter is the pain a little
},
{
    149.68,153.92
     bit below on the bump. This might be more of a tendonitis but what this will do
},
{
    153.92,158.6
     is this will stretch the tendon prior to competition, prior to you working out and
},
{
    158.6,163.4
     it'll put just a little bit less stress on the bone then. Sure. And it'll also get
},
{
    163.4,167.08
     more blood flow to it. So you're gonna do that for a couple minutes.
},
{
    167.08,168.16
     Couple minutes.
},
{
    168.16,170.6
     And your fingers aren't gonna get tired actually.
},
{
    170.6,173.12
     If you do that, it's very tender and continues to hurt
},
{
    173.12,174.8
     and it creates a lot of pain,
},
{
    174.8,176.72
     then you probably wanna avoid it.
},
{
    176.72,178.96
     But after about 30 seconds to a minute,
},
{
    178.96,181.6
     it should start to feel a little bit better,
},
{
    181.6,182.6
     maybe even a little numbish,
},
{
    182.6,183.68
     then you know you're right on.
},
{
    183.68,184.64
     Right.
},
{
    184.64,189.68
     So you can go right from that into the second treatment for our second way
},
{
    189.68,193.68
     to manage Oskar Schlatter, which is you are going to have to warm up and you're
},
{
    193.68,197.48
     going to have to warm up more than any of your classmates or teammates or
},
{
    197.48,202.0
     anything like that. You've got to really emphasize because you really want to make
},
{
    202.0,207.76
     sure the muscles are as stretched as far as possible and warmed up as far as possible. So the first thing you want to
},
{
    207.76,211.74
     make sure especially you want to make sure you're stretching the quadriceps.
},
{
    211.74,216.8
     Right. So let's check that out.
},
{
    216.8,221.6
     So to stretch the quadriceps there's a lot of ways to do it but what I like just
},
{
    221.6,225.7
     the standing way and you can grab the ankle
},
{
    225.7,231.2
     or if you grab the foot by the opposite but I just grab the ankle like this and
},
{
    231.2,235.8
     I pull back like this keep a good posture and right here if you want to add a
},
{
    235.8,240.92
     little twist to it you tilt your pelvis down sure you sure tilt down in
},
{
    240.92,246.4
     spread so it's going back this way and you'll find it you'll feel it stretch right
},
{
    246.4,252.0
     there more when you pull this knee back this way and keep your shoulder. You've got a little string
},
{
    252.0,257.52
     on your shirt. We can't have that in our video. Anyways so here we go we're going to stretch that
},
{
    257.52,262.56
     out. You're going to get a good hip flexor stretch along with this and that quadra stuff. You can
},
{
    262.56,270.36
     do this laying down too which is a little more comfortable depending and I kind of like doing this just because you can relax. I
},
{
    270.36,275.28
     can relax more anyways and again it's like you stretch and then if you
},
{
    275.28,278.2
     push up a little bit here you'll get some more stretch. So it's just another
},
{
    278.2,283.28
     option. It's very important that you do that stretch. The hamstring
},
{
    283.28,289.0
     stretch is important too. You can find a wall or something that's about this height
},
{
    289.0,296.0
     Keeping good posture, just going to lean forward, that's about as far as I can go Brad. Knee straight, don't let the knee bend
},
{
    296.0,301.0
     That's cheating, good long stretch on both of those
},
{
    301.0,308.68
     And then you're going to want to start warming up the muscles slowly. By the way, one of the strengthening exercises we want you
},
{
    308.68,312.6
     to do for the quadricep is what is called eccentric and that's strengthening it
},
{
    312.6,317.28
     while you're going lowering down basically. So what you're going to do is
},
{
    317.28,320.36
     you're going to start off and you're going to lower yourself onto a chair like
},
{
    320.36,325.1
     this and then you can go up with both legs and then again lower yourself
},
{
    325.1,334.76
     onto a chair. It'll be easier on here if it's too painful to do this and you
},
{
    334.76,346.36
     should go on a higher surface. I couldn't lower myself all the way down. If you're 15, 20, or 12, 15, you probably can do that.
},
{
    346.36,349.8
     You can do this easier with better balance, I'm not keeping over 50.
},
{
    349.8,358.0
     And then you can do slow side stepping, braiding, retroambulation, all these
},
{
    358.0,362.32
     things very slowly to get the muscles warmed up, kind of some of that
},
{
    362.32,366.36
     dynamic stretching. Yeah, so you're gonna do these warm-ups before you get out to ready
},
{
    366.36,369.62
     Do your full spritzer, you know, whatever your activity is
},
{
    369.64,376.76
     Okay, the other thing then the third treatment for our good slaughter category basically is how do you decrease the pain?
},
{
    377.08,381.6
     So one thing after every event after every athletic event every practice
},
{
    381.6,384.52
     I want you to ice it and a quick way to ice
},
{
    386.04,389.84
     Is to actually just take a styrofoam cup and fill it with water, put it in your freezer and
},
{
    389.84,398.04
     after it's frozen you just tear off the top to get down to the ice and as you
},
{
    398.04,401.84
     put my hand on to smooth out the ice a little bit and then you can just go ahead
},
{
    401.84,406.26
     and put it on there and rub it until it gets numb and you know that way
},
{
    406.26,409.96
     It's not going to take that long to cool it down and do it right on the bone
},
{
    409.96,412.96
     Usually about five minutes, five minutes or less
},
{
    412.96,416.96
     Put a towel under your leg otherwise you get a wet floor and your mom will get mad at you
},
{
    416.96,418.24
     That's right
},
{
    418.24,421.54
     The other way you can just throw an ice pack on and you can leave that off for 20 minutes
},
{
    421.54,423.04
     Sure, if you want to
},
{
    423.04,425.4
     Strapping, do you want to show the strap Brad? Sure
},
{
    429.2,435.88
     This is something you have to trial with and see how it works, but they're not real expensive if it's not effective
},
{
    435.88,437.88
     It's not a big loss
},
{
    438.64,445.26
     This one they call them a chou pad, but that's just a manufacturer. There's other companies that make it. It's kind of like a rope
},
{
    445.98,452.6
     within size the strap, so there's a bump there at a ridge and you put that right above the bump over that
},
{
    452.68,457.68
     tendon, that hollow spot below the kneecap and that bump and then you just simply
},
{
    458.6,460.6
     strap it.
},
{
    461.24,464.24
     A little tight there and give that a whirl.
},
{
    464.24,467.56
     The idea is that you're taking some of the stress off that bump
},
{
    467.56,472.04
     And now instead of the tendon pulling on the bump, it's pulling right here. That's the idea
},
{
    472.04,476.2
     Now I think the effectiveness of this is questionable
},
{
    476.2,480.32
     But I would try it, it's worth a try and you can actually tape this way
},
{
    480.32,483.32
     There's a taping method even for doing this. Sure.
},
{
    482.48,485.92
     this way, there's a taping method even for this. Sure, it's a, yeah, I'd say if it doesn't work,
},
{
    485.92,487.54
     you're not out a lot of money.
},
{
    487.54,489.56
     I've had people worse, they like it.
},
{
    489.56,490.72
     Yeah, they like it.
},
{
    490.72,493.0
     And you know, if even it gives a little bit of relief,
},
{
    493.0,495.28
     it may be worth trying.
},
{
    495.28,496.8
     Another issue we want to consider
},
{
    496.8,500.24
     to help decrease pain, sometimes if you have flat feet,
},
{
    500.24,502.6
     that will contribute to, I should slaughter,
},
{
    502.6,504.44
     believe it or not, and the way it does,
},
{
    504.44,505.0
     is this bone
},
{
    505.52,511.6
     gets turned when you have flat feet and when this bone gets turned it actually puts more stress on the tendon
},
{
    511.6,518.16
     Right, so every time you put weight bearing through that leg that bone will slightly rotate and it does affect the stress on that
},
{
    518.16,523.48
     So it may want to get some more thottics to help prevent the foot from flattening out, right?
},
{
    523.68,525.0
     Some arch support, which may help you in other reasons, you out. Right, some arched reports.
},
{
    525.0,527.0
     Yeah, which may help you in other reasons,
},
{
    527.0,528.4
     you know, anyway, reasons anyway.
},
{
    528.4,532.4
     But the final thing really is you have to understand
},
{
    532.4,535.4
     that you do have a syndrome or a disease
},
{
    535.4,539.0
     and it's not going to go away until you're done growing.
},
{
    539.0,540.6
     So you need to manage it,
},
{
    540.6,543.0
     which means you manage it with rest at times.
},
{
    543.0,549.06
     You may not be able to work out as much as you want and you may not be able to even possibly you're
},
{
    549.06,552.7
     playing timey at the beginning of the race. You just can't push through this.
},
{
    552.7,557.94
     Particularly things like if you want to do squats and things where you're lifting a
},
{
    557.94,562.38
     lot of weight, this is going to irritate it and you're not going to progress. It's
},
{
    562.38,568.0
     probably actually going to make a major flare up. You're gonna have to figure out how much you can work out
},
{
    568.0,569.36
     and how much you can play
},
{
    569.36,571.52
     and still keep the pain at a manageable level.
},
{
    571.52,573.0
     And that's only for you to discover,
},
{
    573.0,575.2
     but you need to understand that.
},
{
    575.2,576.88
     So good luck with it.
},
{
    576.88,578.0
     I know it's a crappy thing,
},
{
    578.0,580.6
     but I guess that's life, isn't it?
},
{
    580.6,582.8
     Right, and when you're young and you got this,
},
{
    582.8,585.54
     you're probably feeling strong like bolt everywhere else
},
{
    585.54,590.96

{
