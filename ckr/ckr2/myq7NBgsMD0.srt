     Now let's cover shock emergencies. In this scenario we had an individual who was
},
{
    7.8,12.84
     bleeding from an arterial wound and lost quite a bit of blood. Now they didn't
},
{
    12.84,18.4
     pass out but they were starting to feel dizzy and lightheaded. So we helped lay
},
{
    18.4,22.64
     them to the ground and now we're going to be suspect that they either are going
},
{
    22.64,28.52
     into kind of a psychogenic psychosomatic shock, which is more psychological because they've seen all the blood and they're
},
{
    28.52,34.28
     concerned, or they might have lost enough that they're having some hypovolemic shock,
},
{
    34.28,36.96
     which means low blood volume.
},
{
    36.96,40.28
     Either way, the symptoms are the same and we're not going to take a chance.
},
{
    40.28,41.64
     We're going to treat them.
},
{
    41.64,46.92
     Gloves are on, our shield is available with a one-way valve, and we've checked for scene safety.
},
{
    46.92,48.36
     The scene is safe.
},
{
    48.36,50.16
     They are responding to me.
},
{
    50.16,53.08
     They are breathing normally, and they do have a pulse.
},
{
    53.08,56.24
     So it's still something where we're trying to decide,
},
{
    56.24,57.88
     do we call 911 or not?
},
{
    57.88,60.08
     But as soon as I see that they're pale,
},
{
    60.08,62.52
     that they're starting to lose a level of consciousness
},
{
    62.52,64.72
     or going to pass out, in my opinion,
},
{
    64.72,67.36
     that's time to call 911. You in the plaid shirt,
},
{
    67.36,71.52
     go call 911 and come back, bring an AED with you if you can find one.
},
{
    71.52,76.24
     And so now we're ready to begin treatment. I want to reassess like I just did for
},
{
    76.24,80.24
     normal breathing and for a pulse, but now I see that they're a little
},
{
    80.24,86.44
     pale. I squeeze the nail bed and turn it white and then I let go. It takes
},
{
    86.44,92.4
     longer than it takes me to say capillary refill for it to refill. This is an
},
{
    92.4,97.8
     early sign of potential shock. To treat this I'm now going to explain to my
},
{
    97.8,103.92
     patient what's going on. I'm going to elevate their legs. It's important that
},
{
    103.92,105.08
     you just find something that's 6-12 inches high. It's important that you just find something
},
{
    105.08,106.56
     that's 6, 12 inches high.
},
{
    106.56,108.08
     It doesn't have to be super high,
},
{
    108.08,110.76
     but you could use a stool, a chair, a box,
},
{
    110.76,113.0
     whatever you have available.
},
{
    113.0,114.44
     I have a blanket here,
},
{
    114.44,117.36
     but you wouldn't have to necessarily use a blanket.
},
{
    117.36,120.76
     You could use coats, you could use newspaper,
},
{
    120.76,123.82
     anything that helps maintain the body temperature
},
{
    123.82,125.32
     of the person that is going
},
{
    125.32,129.48
     into shock because this is going to help maintain their core body temperature.
},
{
    129.48,133.96
     When they start going into shock their body shunts the blood from the
},
{
    133.96,139.44
     extremities and brings it back to their vital organs. This makes them very cold
},
{
    139.44,147.2
     to the peripheral. When this happens the body will only take so long before it thinks it needs to reheat the rest of the body.
},
{
    147.4,154.72
     When it does that it will re-vase or dilate and the blood pressure that they do have could drop again.
},
{
    154.84,158.26
     So we want to help combat that by keeping them warm,
},
{
    158.68,169.6
     comforted them and watching for regular breathing, making sure they're awake, and if they ever change, lose their breathing, lose their pulse, we're going to respond with CPR and
},
{
    169.6,173.2
     wait for EMS to arrive.
},
