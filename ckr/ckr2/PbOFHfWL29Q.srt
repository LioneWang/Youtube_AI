     So today we're talking about a pinched nerve in your neck and what can cause that particular
},
{
    9.96,10.96
     problem.
},
{
    10.96,17.5
     Actually, it's not like you think like a nerve is being actually pinched by some muscle.
},
{
    17.5,28.88
     It typically comes from your disc area. So C6-7 is typically where you have disc problems. You can use the C7 discs or
},
{
    28.88,34.72
     spinal processes here. The bone that sticks out. So between C6 and C7 is
},
{
    34.72,39.72
     typically where you have nerve problems that are resulting from discs that can
},
{
    39.72,43.52
     cause you to have pinched nerve type symptoms. And you can see here,
},
{
    43.52,46.14
     cervical or radiculopathy,
},
{
    46.14,49.24
     you can see that the nerves travel down in between your
},
{
    49.24,52.68
     shoulder blades and all the way down the back of your arm and
},
{
    52.68,54.18
     around your hand.
},
{
    54.18,58.26
     So having pain in between your shoulder blades and chronic
},
{
    58.26,61.86
     pain with real serious muscle spasms all the time,
},
{
    61.86,63.9
     you need to get that checked out because it could be an
},
{
    63.9,66.74
     indication of a cervical disc. Even though you don't have arm pain all the time, you need to get that checked out because it could be an indication of a cervical disc.
},
{
    66.74,69.74
     Even though you don't have arm pain all the way down your arm,
},
{
    69.74,73.94
     a pinched nerve or a disc that is compressing on a nerve could
},
{
    73.94,77.64
     actually cause you to have chronic muscle spasms in this
},
{
    77.64,78.64
     area.
},
{
    78.64,81.4
     So treatment for this, sometimes massage and mouth
},
{
    81.4,87.64
     fascial type of releases are helpful, but sometimes are temporary
},
{
    87.64,89.14
     relief.
},
{
    89.14,94.2
     Sometimes people will have to undergo a nerve block, which is done in an imaging center
},
{
    94.2,100.72
     with an anesthesiologist that injects the actual disc area or the nerve root to decompress,
},
{
    100.72,108.18
     not to decompress, but to reduce the pain that is causing the nerve to contract the muscle.
},
{
    108.18,111.14
     So the muscle is in spasm, but the problem is up here.
},
{
    111.14,115.32
     Now another thing that's important is to have good postural stability.
},
{
    115.32,118.56
     So we have a normal cervical curve and then a thoracic curve.
},
{
    118.56,123.34
     So sometimes people have a flat neck here, so we want them to maintain a more normal
},
{
    123.34,129.0
     curve and we can do that by strengthening the muscles in between the shoulder blades and stretching out the
},
{
    129.0,133.74
     muscles in the front. A pinched nerve is a debilitating problem for some people.
},
{
    133.74,138.94
     I think an accurate diagnosis is a key to results on this.
