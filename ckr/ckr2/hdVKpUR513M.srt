    85.0,91.0
     Yeah, well done, well done. I attempt to breathe slowly and deeply to help control their breathing.

    91.0,93.5
     Sit them down in a comfortable position.
},

     getting worse, or they become exhausted, call 999 or 112 for emergency help.
},

     Help them to continue to use the inhale as needed.
},
{
    122.6,127.2
     Keep checking their breathing, pulse, and level of response.
