     So if you haven't already make sure you click on that subscribe button down
},
{
    18.96,22.96
     there otherwise I won't see your comments and if I don't see your comments how can
},
{
    22.96,28.36
     I answer them? Okay so instead of cracking your neck these stretches and exercises are a
},
{
    28.36,32.16
     great way to kind of loosen everything up and sometimes they actually get a
},
{
    32.16,36.04
     little pop as well. We're going to start off with isometric exercises and
},
{
    36.04,40.5
     isometric exercises really do sometimes if you need that pop if that's
},
{
    40.5,43.88
     something that you enjoy getting you can get that sometimes with isometric
},
{
    43.88,47.96
     exercises. So isometric exercises, really just you're activating
},
{
    47.96,51.68
     the muscles but you're not moving. So you're pushing into something that's not
},
{
    51.68,55.52
     moving and you can easily do that with your hands. So the first one is just
},
{
    55.52,60.4
     going to be a side bend movement but you're not going to actually do that
},
{
    60.4,64.0
     movement. This is what you're pushing into. This is the motion you're going to
},
{
    64.0,67.48
     be pushing into but you're going to put your hand just on the side of
},
{
    67.48,72.48
     your head and then push into your hand. But see my head's moving a little bit
},
{
    72.48,75.72
     just because I want you to see the motion I'm doing but really your head
},
{
    75.72,80.94
     shouldn't be moving at all. So this is me just pushing into my hand and so to
},
{
    80.94,85.6
     start off you really just want to push maybe only about 20 or 30% because
},
{
    85.6,90.72
     if your neck is hurting, if it's painful, you don't want to push too hard.
},
{
    90.72,95.86
     Just hold that push for about three to five seconds holding that contraction and then
},
{
    95.86,96.86
     relaxing.
},
{
    96.86,99.08
     You can do alternating sides if you want to.
},
{
    99.08,104.38
     So then this is the motion I would be doing and now I'm pushing it into my hand this way.
},
{
    104.38,105.12
     And then you can do
},
{
    105.12,110.0
     three to five doing that three to five second hold on each side. You can alternate or if you just
},
{
    110.0,114.08
     want to do them all on one side if you can tell that's usually the side that you need to get that
},
{
    114.08,118.24
     pop you can just do them all on one side but I would do both sides just because it's your neck
},
{
    118.24,123.76
     and you want to keep it balanced. So then the next one is another isometric exercise but this
},
{
    123.76,125.52
     time you're going to be doing rotation.
},
{
    125.52,130.42
     So this is the motion that you'll be doing, but you're not actually going to do that motion.
},
{
    130.42,134.84
     So still kind of placing your hand on the side of your head, and now I'm pushing in.
},
{
    134.84,140.64
     So I'm going to move my eyes to where I want my head to go and just pushing in like that.
},
{
    140.64,144.52
     So I'm doing this, but my hand is stopping me from doing it.
},
{
    144.52,146.56
     And then alternating sides
},
{
    146.56,152.16
     pushing the other way. So again that three to five second hold doing it five times on each side.
},
{
    152.16,157.52
     If you want to alternate back and forth you can but you don't have to. Then the next one is going
},
{
    157.52,163.52
     to be an extension isometric movement. So you can do this one against a wall if this is uncomfortable
},
{
    163.52,167.64
     to kind of put your hand behind your head you can actually just one against a wall. If this is uncomfortable to kind of put your hand behind your head, you can actually just lean against a wall
},
{
    167.64,171.36
     and push back into it. But if you don't have a wall behind you or a tall chair
},
{
    171.36,174.72
     that you can push into, just place your hand on your back of your head and this
},
{
    174.72,178.84
     time, so this is the movement, I'm trying to push my head back looking up,
},
{
    178.84,183.58
     but my hand is stopping me from doing it. So again, you know, that three to five
},
{
    183.58,187.52
     seconds hold maybe five times
},
{
    187.52,191.6
     in a row this time you don't have a side to alternate to, but just making sure that you're
},
{
    191.6,196.48
     starting off with maybe 20 to 30 percent of your push and if it feels okay the next day then you
},
{
    196.48,201.6
     can go 30, 40, 40, 50 and so on until you're pushing you know hard enough where you might actually
},
{
    201.6,210.16
     get that pop. You might not so don't expect it to happen. You should still feel relief doing it even if you don't hear an audible pop or feel a pop.
},
{
    210.16,214.48
     So then the next one is one of my favorites which is chin tugs. And chin tugs if you've
},
{
    214.48,220.48
     watched any of my videos is one that is great for posture, is great for neck pain, is great for just
},
{
    220.48,227.86
     kind of resetting everything. So if you feel like you have to pop your neck a lot, most likely it's because you don't have great posture and then when
},
{
    227.86,231.28
     you pop it you're kind of adjusting everything back into place. So with a
},
{
    231.28,236.12
     chin tuck it's not tucking down like this but it's actually tucking your chin
},
{
    236.12,240.54
     in this way. You're moving your head backwards and so a lot of times I like
},
{
    240.54,244.68
     to use my finger as a target. You don't have to but I just feel like this kind of
},
{
    244.68,249.52
     helps you visualize what you're doing. So you're just going to place your finger on your chin and you're
},
{
    249.52,253.84
     going to leave it there. The finger stays in one spot and then I'm tucking in so you can see I have
},
{
    253.84,258.16
     lots of little chins right there and I'm just holding it for about three to five seconds. And
},
{
    258.16,263.2
     then when I relax, a lot of times there's a little bit of space in between just and all that means is
},
{
    263.2,266.72
     now I'm correcting that posture. So sometimes even just doing one you can see a
},
{
    266.72,271.08
     difference because if you're sitting like this all day making those muscles
},
{
    271.08,274.8
     activate back there and stretching everything back out and activating them
},
{
    274.8,279.44
     as well really helps kind of reset everything. So again that three to five
},
{
    279.44,283.6
     second hold again bringing everything back keeping that chin in a neutral
},
{
    283.6,288.82
     position so it's not coming like this or it's not coming up like this it's just bringing that head
},
{
    288.82,292.7
     straight back behind you and then holding that for that three to five
},
{
    292.7,297.76
     seconds maybe doing five or ten at a time. So then going into some stretches so
},
{
    297.76,301.9
     if you feel like you always have to to pop your neck a lot a lot of times it's
},
{
    301.9,307.12
     because of tight neck muscles around the area sometimes even those muscles that go into the shoulders. So if you've got a
},
{
    307.12,310.44
     little imbalance or if you've got some tightness it's going to pull stuff and
},
{
    310.44,314.04
     cause it sometimes to get out of alignment or cause it to have that feeling
},
{
    314.04,318.32
     where you want to pop it to to get that relief. So an upper trap stretch is a
},
{
    318.32,322.24
     great one to do and that's that big muscle in the upper part of your neck
},
{
    322.24,328.8
     that goes down into your shoulders. So a lot of times I'll tell people to kind of sit on their hand. If it's
},
{
    328.8,332.84
     uncomfortable to sit on your hand you can just kind of push it down. Sometimes
},
{
    332.84,336.08
     even people put it behind their back. I like just kind of sitting on it and
},
{
    336.08,339.72
     that just keeps this shoulder down. So if I'm stretching this side this is the
},
{
    339.72,343.92
     side that I want to sit on. Then I'm just going to bring my hand my other hand up
},
{
    343.92,345.0
     and over and I just want to keep my head in a neutral position. Then I'm just gonna bring my hand, my other hand up and over,
},
{
    345.0,347.74
     and I just wanna keep my head in a neutral position.
},
{
    347.74,349.84
     So I'm not looking down, I'm not looking up.
},
{
    349.84,352.96
     I'm just pulling straight over to the side,
},
{
    352.96,355.48
     and I should feel that stretch kind of right up and through
},
{
    355.48,358.36
     here, and that's where that upper trap comes into that neck.
},
{
    358.36,361.56
     Again, you don't have to sit on your hand or push it down,
},
{
    361.56,363.32
     but you'll get a better stretch.
},
{
    363.32,368.42
     That just gives me a nice stretch feeling that. And so this is gonna be a full stretch so
},
{
    368.42,373.42
     you're holding it for 30 seconds. Come up again even if you feel like usually one
},
{
    373.42,377.98
     side is the side that you need. I would stretch both sides because the neck,
},
{
    377.98,382.74
     those muscles on each side really have you know when it's connected to the
},
{
    382.74,385.08
     spine you want those both to be flexible
},
{
    385.08,390.16
     and mobile so they're not causing imbalances. So 30 second holds doing that
},
{
    390.16,394.58
     three times on each side to really get that good stretch. So the next stretch is
},
{
    394.58,398.88
     the levator scapulae stretch and the levator scap is the one that comes up
},
{
    398.88,402.76
     and attaches here all the way down to your shoulder blade and it elevates or
},
{
    402.76,408.4
     elevates that shoulder blade and so it's really important because a lot of times if you're working really hard on a computer
},
{
    408.4,412.88
     or you're focusing on something you tend to tighten up like this and that causes a lot of pain in
},
{
    412.88,416.72
     that neck and feels like you know sometimes you got to crack the neck to get that relief in there.
},
{
    416.72,421.6
     So this is a great stretch to do. So to start off with this one if I'm stretching this side
},
{
    421.6,425.2
     I'm going to bring my arm up and try and take my elbow towards the
},
{
    425.2,429.6
     ceiling. Now if you can't do this, if this is uncomfortable, that's okay. Some people will just
},
{
    429.6,434.64
     raise their arm. You can do that as well or you don't have to put it up here. But again, if I put
},
{
    434.64,440.24
     my hand here, I'm pushing that shoulder blade down or keeping it stable down there to get a better
},
{
    440.24,449.48
     stretch. Now this one is a little bit different because I'm going to take the other hand and put it behind my head. I'm going to pull my head down at about a
},
{
    449.48,453.32
     45 degree angle so it's not coming straight down, it's not going down towards
},
{
    453.32,458.48
     the side, but I'm turning my head so my nose is going towards the opposite knee.
},
{
    458.48,462.48
     So this one sometimes people don't quite get, but it's coming bringing my hand
},
{
    462.48,469.18
     behind my head and bringing that nose down towards the opposite side. So I should feel that stretch right through
},
{
    469.18,473.28
     there. So it shouldn't really be on the side like that upper traffic. It should be
},
{
    473.28,477.2
     a little bit more in the back and if you're not quite feeling it, turn your
},
{
    477.2,482.32
     head a little bit more at that angle and pull down. So again this is another 30
},
{
    482.32,489.72
     seconds stretch. You're holding it for 30 seconds and again I would do both sides turning that head and that nose
},
{
    489.72,494.48
     pointing towards the opposite elbow and coming down holding it for that 30 second
},
{
    494.48,497.96
     stretch. Doing that three times on each side again just keeping everything
},
{
    497.96,502.36
     balanced and even and so that's really nice way to loosen everything up. And so
},
{
    502.36,509.36
     the last one is just going to be an anterior scalene stretch and so these are the muscles in the front. So again all
},
{
    509.36,513.4
     these muscles around the neck if they're tight, if they're in balance pulling on
},
{
    513.4,516.32
     something, you're gonna have that feeling of where you want to pop that neck or
},
{
    516.32,520.64
     kind of crack that neck to readjust everything. So this time what you're
},
{
    520.64,523.76
     gonna do is you're gonna take the opposite side. So if I want to stretch this
},
{
    523.76,526.0
     side I'm taking my opposite hand and just kind of placing
},
{
    526.0,529.72
     it on my collarbone right there that clavicle and so I'm just going to gently
},
{
    529.72,534.12
     pull down on that again to kind of stabilize everything then I'm going to
},
{
    534.12,539.72
     turn my head towards that side and look up and I should feel that stretch right
},
{
    539.72,543.28
     through there getting that nice stretch so I'm just kind of then looking up
},
{
    543.28,548.64
     towards the ceiling. If you want a slightly different stretch you can turn it the other way and it's going to get a little
},
{
    548.64,554.56
     bit more towards the side maybe the SCM so you can do both but I like this one that gives a nice
},
{
    554.56,559.36
     stretch. So it's almost like one of my patients said that you're posing for a picture kind of
},
{
    559.36,568.36
     gazing up in a way at something but again this is that 30 second stretch, doing that three times. Again I would do that on each side so kind of pulling that collarbone
},
{
    568.36,573.28
     down, looking towards that side and then looking up towards the ceiling. You
},
{
    573.28,576.72
     might not have heard that but I actually did just get a little pop in my neck. So
},
{
    576.72,580.8
     that's good. It's getting that relief in there without just taking your head and
},
{
    580.8,584.56
     cracking it. So there you have it. Those were seven stretches and exercises for
},
{
    584.56,587.32
     your neck instead of cracking it. If you'd like to help support
