     Painful shoulders and stiff neck are usually your results of either injury or overuse.
},
{
    20.28,28.4
     Following stretches can be done anytime and anywhere, allowing your neck more movement and preventing pain from reoccurring.

     Warm-up is essential part of preparation leading to your exercises.

     To achieve best results, please, spend from 1 to 3 minutes rolling and turning your head

     steadily in all directions.

     This will eliminate any risk of accidental injuries.

     Pull your head towards your chest. Hold it there for 10 seconds.
},
{
    72.4,79.4
     Okay, go again. However this time try to pull your head slightly further.
},
{
    79.4,90.82
     Hold the stretch for 10 seconds. This time try to go as far as possible. You should experience
},
{
    90.82,108.64
     that stretch in the middle of your back. Good, shake it off and let's do some more. Stretch number two. Start by turning your head to the side
},
{
    108.64,114.08
     and then pull it downwards. Hold the stretch for about 10 seconds.
},
{
    119.52,126.72
     Go again, increase the stretch. Hold it for just about 10 seconds. You should feel it on

{
    126.72,137.0
     the side of your neck. Go again and try to go as far as you can. Hold the stretch
},
{
    137.0,146.0
     for 10 seconds. If you can feel the pull on the top of his shoulder blade, you do a net ride.
},
{
    146.0,151.0
     Lovely, do exactly the same thing on the other side.
},
{
    174.64,176.64
     Active stretches. Active stretches are quite powerful. This is why we only go in to do them once.
},
{
    176.64,186.72
     Touch your head and then pull it downwards. Now imagine you want to touch the floor with the opposite arm. This will activate the stretch.
},
{
    186.72,191.16
     Hold it between 5 and 10 seconds.
},
{
    191.16,199.24
     Repeat the whole process on the other side.
},
{
    199.24,202.6
     Turn your head away and then pull it downwards.

    202.6,206.24
     Again we are going to use the opposite arm to activate

{
    206.24,213.2
     the stretch. Hold it between 5 and 10 seconds.
},
{
    218.2,240.08
     After which change sides and repeat the process.
},
{
    240.08,246.8
     Well done. Do a few head rolls, turn your head to the side, flex and extend your neck.
