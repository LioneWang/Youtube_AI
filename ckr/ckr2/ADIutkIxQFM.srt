     Hi, I'm Dr. Adam Fields. Today we're gonna use the power of targeted vibration and stretching to mobilize your hips.
},
{
    7.76,10.82
     Let's go ahead on your back. I'm gonna do one side.
},
{
    11.28,17.18
     If you want to do the other side, just roll the video up again. Hit subscribe while you're at it even.
},
{
    17.18,23.64
     Go ahead on your back and we're gonna start. I'm gonna do my left hip. You do whatever hip works for you.
},
{
    23.64,27.66
     I want you to fire up that gun.
},
{
    27.66,28.5
     Boom.
},
{
    28.5,29.98
     This is whisper quiet.
},
{
    29.98,32.34
     And what we're gonna do is we're gonna start
},
{
    32.34,34.46
     with some mobilization.
},
{
    34.46,36.36
     So I want you to bring the knee up
},
{
    36.36,39.34
     and just hold it with the opposite hand
},
{
    39.34,41.16
     and then push straight down.
},
{
    41.16,42.9
     We're gonna straight down on the bone.
},
{
    42.9,48.32
     This is actually to mobilize the bone itself. Most of the time these hips may have
},
{
    48.32,51.68
     happened when you were 15 and you were playing soccer and you got a little
},
{
    51.68,55.72
     injury and it just slowly crept up and now you're 50 something 60 something and
},
{
    55.72,60.84
     this thing is locked up. So we're going to get some mobilization and some
},
{
    60.84,68.64
     hydration. This is actually helping hydrate the joints. So we're pushing straight down on the top of your femur.
},
{
    68.88,71.7
     And now we're gonna switch hands
},
{
    71.7,76.52
     and you're gonna go on the inner thigh out.
},
{
    76.52,78.94
     If you look at the mechanics of the hip,
},
{
    78.94,82.58
     you will see that this motion is just as important
},
{
    82.58,83.94
     as pushing it down.
},
{
    83.94,86.4
     So go ahead and just push on that.
},
{
    86.4,90.52
     And now let's just do some circles, little circles with your leg.
},
{
    90.52,93.1
     Just move it. See if you can get it to completely relax.
},
{
    93.1,96.86
     I know it's stiff and you've just been holding on and guarding it.
},
{
    96.86,100.48
     But right now just see if you can just let it go.
},
{
    100.48,104.32
     Let that vibration do its thing and just waggle it around.
},
{
    104.32,107.8
     Go to what feels good for that hip.
},
{
    107.8,110.08
     Okay, now let's go a figure four.
},
{
    110.08,112.48
     So figure four just like this,
},
{
    112.48,116.16
     and we're just gonna push straight down like this.
},
{
    116.16,117.92
     Now at just a different angle,
},
{
    117.92,121.88
     rotating that femur inside that ball and socket a little bit,
},
{
    121.88,124.78
     and then vibrating a little bit more.
},
{
    127.16,131.88
     ball and socket a little bit and then vibrating a little bit more. Vibration, it really is great at mobilization. It kind of tricks your body. It allows it to
},
{
    131.88,142.08
     relax and let go even when times it might not. So let it go. Movement is so, it's
},
{
    142.08,145.94
     like a salve. It's like a, you just feel good with movement, right?
},
{
    145.94,147.0
     You've hit your hand with a hammer,
},
{
    147.0,150.16
     you shake it, because that movement decreases pain, right?
},
{
    150.16,153.08
     When a baby is crying, you rock the baby
},
{
    153.08,154.5
     to give it movement, right?
},
{
    154.5,156.76
     This is movement on a super high level.
},
{
    156.76,157.68
     We love this movement.
},
{
    157.68,160.16
     So now just change your angle just a little bit
},
{
    161.48,164.12
     and just push it from the inside out.
},
{
    167.0,172.2
     Crank it up a little bit. Fire it up people. Let's free up that hip of yours.
},
{
    172.2,175.4
     Okay, let's go ahead. We're going to switch hands
},
{
    175.4,178.96
     and take the opposite hand and pull
},
{
    178.96,182.84
     the one leg up. Give it a little stretch as you
},
{
    182.84,185.0
     vibrate it even more.
},
{
    186.0,189.2
     If this is not possible, just bring it down and go here.
},
{
    189.2,191.64
     Not a problem, you're doing great for yourself.
},
{
    191.64,194.32
     How does it feel to be doing exactly
},
{
    194.32,196.44
     what you need to be doing for your hip?
},
{
    196.44,200.6
     Right there, right now, mobilization.
},
{
    200.6,202.44
     Let's prevent a hip replacement.
},
{
    202.44,205.28
     Let's do it, let's make this work for you.
},
{
    205.28,206.92
     Just getting a nice stretch.
},
{
    206.92,211.92
     And now we're going to let that whole thing just fall to the side.
},
{
    211.92,213.2
     Just like this.
},
{
    213.2,214.68
     And stretch it out.
},
{
    214.68,218.32
     Now there's a muscle, the upper outer glute right here.
},
{
    218.32,221.56
     It's called the glute medius.
},
{
    221.56,222.84
     And we're going to target that muscle.
},
{
    222.84,224.32
     You can really go for it.
},
{
    224.32,226.0
     A lot of people have tight glute medius
},
{
    226.8,232.96
     Especially if your hip is high on that side or if your femur is jammed into the socket just go right into that
},
{
    232.96,239.04
     We're stretching it while we're vibrating it. I'm gonna stop talking for a second while you just take some deep breaths
},
{
    239.56,255.4
     Let it relax, stretch, good. Good.
},
{
    257.6,260.84
     Good, now come back on your back, straighten the leg and let that just come down.
},
{
    260.84,264.12
     Now some of you are gonna be up here or up here
},
{
    264.12,269.24
     and it's really tight and some of you are gonna come down. Now some of you are going to be up here or up here and it's really tight and some of you are going to come down here but let's get that addoctor
},
{
    269.24,273.56
     right there. Just work that addoctor.
},
{
    274.56,278.98
     Tight addoctors have been implicated sometimes if you have myofascial
},
{
    278.98,282.74
     trigger points and urination issues also. So you want to just really have nice
},
{
    282.74,285.28
     relaxed addoctors and again this one is kind of a mental thing. you want to just really have nice relaxed adductors. And again,
},
{
    285.28,289.26
     this one is kind of a mental thing. You have to just put your mind on letting
},
{
    289.26,295.08
     this relax. Let that knee just fall to the ground as you slowly move that
},
{
    295.08,301.72
     vibration down your leg. Let it fall. Don't hold on to it anymore. I know you
},
{
    301.72,307.68
     can do it. Good. Now let's put the soles of the feet together,
},
{
    307.68,312.98
     if possible, just like this. And again, some of you will be here, some of you will
},
{
    312.98,316.98
     be allowed to open it up, and now just a little different angle, and we're just
},
{
    316.98,320.18
     going to open it like this.
},
{
    326.32,332.96
     Good. And if this is a part of your world, straighten the opposite leg, and let's just go grab
},
{
    332.96,341.6
     the shin and let's just open that up and push that knee to the ground.
},
{
    341.6,345.76
     And you really get even right way high,
},
{
    345.76,349.52
     right at the insertion of that adductor magnet,
},
{
    349.52,352.68
     right there, working down towards the knee,
},
{
    352.68,353.92
     freeing this up.
},
{
    356.84,358.04
     You have power.
},
{
    358.04,359.68
     You have power in your hand.
},
{
    359.68,361.32
     You have battery technology,
},
{
    361.32,363.84
     but you have the power to help yourself, right?
},
{
    363.84,368.92
     It's not about going to some healthcare practitioner and saying,
},
{
    368.92,369.72
     help me, help me.
},
{
    369.72,371.88
     It's about partnering up with that practitioner.
},
{
    372.2,375.8
     It's about taking charge of your own body.
},
{
    376.28,376.92
     You own it.
},
{
    377.44,380.12
     Nobody's going to care for it like you are going to care for it.
},
{
    382.76,383.24
     Okay.
},
{
    383.6,387.88
     Now what we're going to do, I want to go into straightening the leg and we're going
},
{
    387.88,393.24
     to go right to this bony protuberance right on your hip and we're going to go right below
},
{
    393.24,394.24
     it.
},
{
    394.24,396.96
     This is called the tensor fascialata muscle.
},
{
    396.96,398.12
     Allow that hip to relax.
},
{
    398.12,400.56
     Allow that foot just to fall out.
},
{
    400.56,401.56
     Beautiful.
},
{
    401.56,402.56
     You're doing great.
},
{
    402.56,404.84
     And just take a deep breath.
},
{
    404.84,405.48
     Let that pelvis relax. This is kind of. And just take a deep breath. Let that pelvis
},
{
    405.48,413.56
     relax. It's kind of weird. It's kind of fun. Let's just enjoy it. Good. Now this
},
{
    413.56,416.52
     next spot, you want to be careful of the femoral triangle so you don't want to go
},
{
    416.52,420.92
     too medial, but go just inside that little bump and now you're at something
},
{
    420.92,426.12
     called the iliacus muscle. Right on that iliacus, oh my iliacus,
},
{
    426.12,430.34
     I love my iliacus being massaged, please doc, do it.
},
{
    430.34,431.52
     Well you're doing it.
},
{
    432.4,433.86
     It's a great feeling.
},
{
    434.9,437.22
     You're gonna, I want you to check out your range of motion
},
{
    437.22,439.28
     after this video and see, okay,
},
{
    439.28,441.28
     am I getting a little more range of motion?
},
{
    441.28,442.8
     Are things moving better?
},
{
    442.8,447.0
     Am I walking a little bit easier?
},
{
    450.6,457.1
     Okay, the next muscle is called the psoas. The psoas goes from your leg bone, your femur,
},
{
    457.1,461.68
     to your lumbar spine. So when it gets tight, it can jam that hip up into the socket, it
},
{
    461.68,468.6
     can compress your lumbar discs. We love massaging the psoas. So just come straight up, angle it a little bit in,
},
{
    468.6,474.24
     and go right into that psoas. If you don't feel right, just don't do this.
},
{
    474.24,480.72
     You've got your colon there, you've got the ribs up high. Be careful, go light. If
},
{
    480.72,485.36
     you really relax, you're gonna feel a little muscle that's a little tight in there,
},
{
    485.36,488.4
     and that is not a little muscle, it's a thick muscle.
},
{
    488.4,491.76
     You're so as.
},
{
    491.76,492.76
     Pushing it right in there.
},
{
    492.76,496.64
     I hope you're using a bigger ball because something that's pointed might be a little
},
{
    496.64,507.0
     too much in this spot. Oh, that's feeling great.
},
{
    507.0,518.2
     Okay, let's go ahead and turn the massage gun off.
},
{
    518.2,527.8
     And we're going to try some moves here depending on what your level is, we're gonna go on all fours and we're gonna do
},
{
    527.8,536.08
     a stretch called the pigeon lunge. So bring your knee up, rotate that hip and
},
{
    536.08,547.92
     bring the back leg back just like this. Nice pigeon. Okay now Now you can you don't have to but you can use a massage gun for this also
},
{
    550.04,553.32
     Might as well you've got it. Oh, that is good
},
{
    553.92,558.98
     You can come down like this if if you're able to and just feel that
},
{
    560.16,562.16
     You're right on the
},
{
    563.36,565.0
     Pure formus muscle.
},
{
    565.0,571.02
     Oh, that's a winner.
},
{
    571.02,572.98
     Right on that gluteus medius.
},
{
    572.98,578.66
     Oh, you're mobilizing.
},
{
    578.66,593.52
     All right, now take both knees, go in all fours, bring them wide, bring the feet out,
},
{
    593.52,595.56
     and just kind of come back like that.
},
{
    595.56,596.56
     Let's go on your elbows.
},
{
    596.56,598.56
     It's called frog.
},
{
    598.56,600.56
     And breathe right through.
},
{
    600.56,602.32
     This is an intense stretch.
},
{
    602.32,607.2
     This is not just your little easy stretch here. This is
},
{
    607.2,612.16
     something that's going to get deep into, maybe even breaking up some fibrosis in your hips,
},
{
    612.72,619.12
     maybe bringing you into a new range of motion, a new functional usable range of motion right here.
},
{
    619.12,625.84
     This is a move that I use in my 90-90 video where you actually work out your hips. You may want to check that one
},
{
    625.84,630.8
     out. It's perfect with this one you do this and then you do the other. You are going to have not
},
{
    630.8,645.08
     only mobilized but strong hips. Oh, you've got to realize things take time.
},
{
    645.08,649.56
     It took you time to get here, but hey, it's going to take some time to get back to where
},
{
    649.56,650.56
     you want to be.
},
{
    650.56,654.88
     All right, now we're going to do a little lunge stretch.
},
{
    654.88,663.84
     So I'm going to bring my left back, my right forward, and just do a little bring that pelvis
},
{
    663.84,665.0
     to the ground,
},
{
    665.0,669.64
     the chest is up, and let's just stretch out the psoas muscle.
},
{
    669.64,673.32
     Again, now might be a good time to get that gun
},
{
    673.32,676.82
     back in the game and get right on that muscle.
},
{
    683.88,690.0
     I don't know exact estimates on this, but something like a two minute stretch without
},
{
    690.0,694.08
     the gun is only going to take about 20 seconds with the gun.
},
{
    694.08,697.36
     So you're saving time right now.
},
{
    697.36,707.4
     Okay, let's go ahead and go Indian style if you can, as much as you can.
},
{
    707.4,708.4
     Just like this.
},
{
    708.4,709.4
     Good.
},
{
    709.4,713.56
     Now let's just lean to the side and put that arm down.
},
{
    713.56,715.24
     Stretch that outer hip.
},
{
    715.24,719.56
     Bring that arm up like this and breathe into it.
},
{
    719.56,732.04
     Oh, this is a great stretch. And let's go to the other side.
},
{
    732.04,734.28
     Self-care is what you're doing.
},
{
    734.28,740.08
     Self-care is hands-on and it's high-quality health care.
},
{
    740.08,742.96
     Enjoy it, be here, and be strong.
},
