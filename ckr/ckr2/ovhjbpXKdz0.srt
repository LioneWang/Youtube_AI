     Welcome back everyone.
},
{
    2.88,5.88
     Today I'm going to show you some stretches that give you some pain relief from the side
},
{
    5.88,6.88
     of the calf.
},
{
    6.88,10.8
     Side of the calf occurs when there is an impingement on the spinal cord or anywhere along
},
{
    10.8,15.92
     the way where the side of the nerve runs from the lower back down the hips into the legs.
},
{
    15.92,19.64
     So these stretches are going to loosen up any of the muscles that could be impinging
},
{
    19.64,24.32
     on the side of the nerve or loosen up the joints and the joint spaces where there could
},
{
    24.32,27.52
     be some impingement on the side of the nerve.
},
{
    27.52,30.48
     It could be radiating pain from the back down the legs.
},
{
    30.48,32.94
     If you're experiencing from a lot of pain at the moment
},
{
    32.94,35.4
     from sciatica, I highly recommend you start off
},
{
    35.4,37.5
     on the easiest stretches at the start of the video
},
{
    37.5,40.12
     and progressively move on to more difficult stretches
},
{
    40.12,41.86
     towards the end of the video.
},
{
    41.86,44.36
     That way you don't hurt yourself by starting
},
{
    44.36,49.36
     at the difficult stretches at the end of the video. That is very counterproductive. I hope these stretches helped
},
{
    49.36,58.4
     you as much as they helped me and my patients. Lower back decompressions. This is a technique
},
{
    58.4,63.84
     that has been in a lot of my previous videos and it has helped a lot of people with lower back pain,
},
{
    63.84,66.0
     spinal stenosis which causes
},
{
    66.0,71.76
     sciatica. To do this exercise, place a pillow on the floor and lay your stomach over it.
},
{
    71.76,77.2
     The pillow will press against your pelvis to your stomach. Relax your whole body and take
},
{
    77.2,84.4
     deep and long breaths for 1 to 3 minutes and do this 3 to 4 times. This will stretch the lower
},
{
    84.4,85.08
     back muscles, decompress the lower back muscles,
},
{
    85.08,89.32
     decompress the lower back and open and close the spaces between the vertebrae
},
{
    89.32,93.84
     which is the intervertebral discs. If you don't feel the stretches working you
},
{
    93.84,97.8
     can use an extra pillow. Here I am using a Dutchman's roll also known as a
},
{
    97.8,101.84
     bolster in some countries. I'll leave a link in the description box below on
},
{
    101.84,109.26
     where to get one. This will increase the angle of flexion between the hips and the lower back. It will make them pull apart from each
},
{
    109.26,113.64
     other with each breath, reducing the pressure of the lower back.
},
{
    113.64,118.8
     Knee to chest stretch. Lay on the ground and bring your knees towards your chest in a relaxed
},
{
    118.8,123.36
     and controlled manner. Try not to pull the knees in so much that you're affecting your
},
{
    123.36,126.96
     breathing. Just pull them to the point where you can still breathe comfortably.
},
{
    126.96,133.44
     Hold this position for 8 to 10 deep long breaths and repeat it 3 to 4 times.
},
{
    133.44,138.0
     Whilst you're holding this position, I want you to focus to flatten your back against the ground
},
{
    138.0,143.44
     and press it against the ground, as if you're trying to squash an imaginary tomato or balloon
},
{
    143.44,149.64
     underneath your back. If your hip joint is not allowing you to pull your knees in towards yourself or your belly
},
{
    149.64,154.04
     is too big or if you're pregnant, you can open your legs out slightly and then pull
},
{
    154.04,155.88
     your knees towards your chest.
},
{
    155.88,160.44
     This will create space for your stomach to be in and even allow you to take deeper and
},
{
    160.44,161.56
     longer breaths.
},
{
    161.56,168.68
     This exercise will decompress your lower spine and stretch your lower back and posterior thigh muscles such as your hamstrings and
},
{
    168.68,173.16
     your glutes. Sideic nerve flossing. Sit on a sturdy chair with your knees
},
{
    173.16,177.2
     extended and your leg is straight. Whilst you're raising your leg up extend
},
{
    177.2,181.84
     your neck back at the same time. Every time you lift your leg up point your toes
},
{
    181.84,186.0
     towards your face to create dorsiflexion in the ankle.
},
{
    186.0,190.08
     As dorsiflexion will pull the sciatic nerve down towards your toe.
},
{
    190.08,194.4
     The spinal cord runs all the way from the top of your neck and then branches off into a
},
{
    194.4,197.24
     sciatic nerve into your big toe.
},
{
    197.24,202.08
     This exercise will create a flossing effect on the nerves in the spine down to the sciatic
},
{
    202.08,203.08
     nerve.
},
{
    203.08,205.84
     Threading your nerve up and down through the spaces that
},
{
    205.84,210.14
     the nerves travel through, this will encourage movement through the impingement areas and
},
{
    210.14,215.48
     mobilise the structures here. That's why it's called nerve flossing. Do about 10-15
},
{
    215.48,221.4
     repetitions on each leg and alternate each leg 3-4 times. You don't need to have your
},
{
    221.4,228.88
     leg fully extended and your knee locked out as this may cause too much tension if you have sciatica, which causes a lot of pain.
},
{
    228.88,233.72
     Do your best to keep your leg straight, but if it causes too much pain, just keep it slightly
},
{
    233.72,235.2
     bent and that's okay.
},
{
    235.2,239.72
     A slightly bent leg that is causing a little bit of discomfort is safe and is enough to
},
{
    239.72,242.16
     progressively get you better.
},
{
    242.16,247.24
     The Journal of Physical Therapy Science released a paper on the effects of self-mobilization
},
{
    247.24,252.6
     techniques for sciatic nerves on physical functions and health of lower back pain patients
},
{
    252.6,255.12
     with lower limb radiating pain.
},
{
    255.12,257.48
     The research was done on two groups.
},
{
    257.48,262.8
     Group 1 was to do stabilizing exercises and nerve mobilization techniques and Group 2
},
{
    262.8,265.6
     was to do only stabilization to exercises.
},
{
    265.6,270.44
     Group 1 appeared to have much larger improvement with physical function and general health
},
{
    270.44,272.08
     compared to group 2.
},
{
    272.08,277.6
     Hence why I highly recommend doing stretches and exercises to help you have pain relief
},
{
    277.6,279.52
     and improve your health.
},
{
    279.52,283.32
     So please try out the back exercises on this channel as well.
},
{
    283.32,285.22
     Seated Periform and Stretch.
},
{
    285.22,290.2
     Sit in a chair with your feet on the floor and your knees bent at a 90 degree angle.
},
{
    290.2,294.44
     Then raise the leg that you want to stretch up and cross the ankle over to the opposite
},
{
    294.44,295.44
     knee.
},
{
    295.44,299.24
     Grab the knee that you would like to stretch with your opposite hand and draw it towards
},
{
    299.24,300.64
     your shoulder.
},
{
    300.64,306.16
     Now allow your body to bend forward in a controlled and relaxed manner and take 10
},
{
    306.16,310.32
     deep long breaths or hold this position for 30 seconds.
},
{
    310.32,313.88
     Repeat this 3-4 times on each side.
},
{
    313.88,316.6
     Body weighted piriformis stretch.
},
{
    316.6,320.68
     Turn your body to the side so that your leg on the side you are trying to stretch lays
},
{
    320.68,323.6
     flat onto the chair or the bench you are sitting on.
},
{
    323.6,327.48
     Then lean your body over the leg whilst having your shoulders parallel to the shin of the
},
{
    327.48,331.16
     leg that you're trying to stretch and your foot is pointed away from you.
},
{
    331.16,335.56
     Try to bring your opposite shoulder towards your knee as you're trying to do this stretch.
},
{
    335.56,339.6
     Your body weight will allow you to sink in the stretch further without having to use too
},
{
    339.6,346.24
     much strength to pull the opposite knee towards yourself. Hold this position for 10 deep long breaths or
},
{
    346.24,354.16
     hold this position for 30 seconds and do this on both legs 3 to 4 times. This is a great way to
},
{
    354.16,359.36
     stretch a pair of former muscles and your lower back muscles especially if you find it hard to get
},
{
    359.36,366.92
     on the floor and do the exercises and stretches. Knee to shoulder stretch. Sit on a floor with both legs in front of you
},
{
    366.92,368.72
     and cross the leg that you wanna stretch
},
{
    368.72,370.4
     over the other leg.
},
{
    370.4,374.04
     Placing the foot flat on a floor against the other knee.
},
{
    374.04,376.24
     Now pull the knee from the side you're trying to stretch
},
{
    376.24,378.4
     towards your opposite shoulder.
},
{
    378.4,380.8
     This will stretch the periformis muscle
},
{
    380.8,382.24
     and some of the lower back muscle.
},
{
    382.24,384.36
     Try not to use excessive amounts of strength
},
{
    384.36,388.58
     to create the stretch, as this will cause you to tense up and have poor breathing. Hold
},
{
    388.58,393.76
     this position for about 10 deep long breaths or hold the position for about 30 seconds
},
{
    393.76,399.12
     and repeat this on both sides. The periformis muscle is located in the back of the hip and
},
{
    399.12,404.22
     is the external rotator of the hip joint. The sciatic nerve runs along here and can be
},
{
    404.22,409.32
     irritated by the periformis muscle, especially when the muscle is aggravated or spasming, which
},
{
    409.32,414.52
     may mimic sciatic symptoms. Supine periformis stretch. Start by laying on
},
{
    414.52,418.24
     your back and place your ankle you would like to stretch on your other knee.
},
{
    418.24,421.84
     Bring the knee on the side that you're trying to stretch towards your opposite
},
{
    421.84,428.48
     shoulder. You should feel a slight stretch in the bum or behind the thigh on the leg that you're trying to stretch. The assisting knee will
},
{
    428.48,434.24
     help you hold the position with greater ease. I like to have one hand pulling the knee towards
},
{
    434.24,438.4
     the shoulder and the other hand to guide the ankle to be in the right position. Try not to
},
{
    438.4,445.66
     over exert yourself as you may tense up and cause more harm than good. Hold this position in a relaxed manner for 30 seconds
},
{
    445.66,452.0
     or 10 deep long breaths. And repeat this on both sides 4 to 5 times.
},
{
    452.0,455.28
     Pigeon Pose. Start by sitting on the floor with the stretching
},
{
    455.28,460.64
     leg in front of you and both legs in a bent position. Turn your body towards your bent
},
{
    460.64,469.28
     knee and bring your leg outwards so that your shoulders are parallel to your shin. Now allow your rear leg to point back as straight as possible. Then lean your
},
{
    469.28,473.44
     body over the bent leg. This will create a stretch behind your glutes and your lower
},
{
    473.44,477.8
     back and a little bit in front of the hip of the rear leg. Try to draw the stretching
},
{
    477.8,481.4
     knee towards your opposite shoulder. You can do this by grabbing your knee and allowing
},
{
    481.4,491.08
     your body to lean over to that shoulder. Hold this position for 10 deep long breaths or 30 seconds and repeat on both sides 3-4
},
{
    491.08,492.08
     times.
},
{
    492.08,495.4
     If you would like to minimize this stretch or if you find the stretch too painful, just
},
{
    495.4,497.92
     draw the foot close to your body and lean over it.
},
{
    497.92,501.84
     This will reduce the pre-stretch position of the bent leg and of course when you're
},
{
    501.84,508.48
     ready and you want to increase the stretch, just bring your foot out so that the shin is almost parallel to your shoulders.
},
{
    508.48,512.8
     If you still don't feel the stretch in this position, you can place both hands on either
},
{
    512.8,517.96
     side of the knee and the foot of the stretching leg and push yourself up, locking your arms
},
{
    517.96,519.64
     straight out as possible.
},
{
    519.64,524.32
     Try to keep your chest up nice and straight and pull your shoulders back to practice good
},
{
    524.32,525.18
     posture.
},
{
    525.18,529.18
     By being in this position, you are allowing the weight of your body to sit on the front
},
{
    529.18,530.92
     leg and the rear leg.
},
{
    530.92,535.98
     This will stretch the front hip flexors of the rear leg and the periformis muscle in
},
{
    535.98,537.06
     the front leg.
},
{
    537.06,540.66
     Remember to keep the rear leg as straight as possible.
},
{
    540.66,542.94
     Sphinx and Cobra Pose.
},
{
    542.94,546.16
     Have your forearms flat against the ground and slowly and in
},
{
    546.16,551.04
     a controlled manner push your upper body in an upright position with your chest up nice
},
{
    551.04,555.84
     and straight whilst allowing your hips to sink towards the floor. This will stimulate
},
{
    555.84,561.56
     the back muscles to activate and promote lumbar lordosis, a natural curve you have in your
},
{
    561.56,569.66
     lower back to support the body. Hold this position for 30 seconds to a minute or take 10 deep long breaths.
},
{
    569.66,575.04
     Do this 3-4 times with 1 minute rest between your sets.
},
{
    575.04,579.54
     If the Sphinx pose is too easy for you, you can do the Cobra Pose.
},
{
    579.54,582.32
     This is also known as McKenzie's technique.
},
{
    582.32,589.08
     Just bring your hands close to your body and push all the way up with your elbows locked out. This will create a large arch in your lower back
},
{
    589.08,593.68
     and stretching your abdominals in the front. Remember to breathe in a comfortable and controlled
},
{
    593.68,599.08
     manner each time you take a deep long breath. Hamstring stretch. The hamstrings are not
},
{
    599.08,603.6
     simply a muscle that attaches from A to B, so we will start by stretching on the outer
},
{
    603.6,605.56
     portion of this muscle.
},
{
    605.56,608.64
     Stand up and place your heel on a chair or a bench.
},
{
    608.64,613.26
     And slump your body on the outside of your straight leg, with both arms on the outside
},
{
    613.26,614.56
     of your leg.
},
{
    614.56,617.28
     This will create a stretch on the outer portion of your hamstrings.
},
{
    617.28,621.08
     Your hamstrings tend to be shortened when you are in a sitting position for long periods
},
{
    621.08,628.2
     of time, since bending your knee is one of the main actions of your hamstrings. To stretch the middle portion of your hamstrings just slump your
},
{
    628.2,632.8
     body over your straight leg whilst facing your foot and with each arm on
},
{
    632.8,636.56
     either side of the straight leg. If you can't keep your legs straight and your
},
{
    636.56,641.44
     knees locked out, don't stress because as long as you feel a slight stretch that's
},
{
    641.44,648.52
     enough to create some change. Or rather you do this in a slow and controlled manner and feel a slight stretch then excessively
},
{
    648.52,652.88
     forcing yourself to feel a stretch and possibly injuring yourself.
},
{
    652.88,657.28
     To stretch the inner portion of your hamstrings, just place both of your arms on the inside
},
{
    657.28,659.8
     of your thighs and slump your body over.
},
{
    659.8,667.44
     Hold all these positions for 30 seconds or 10 deep long breaths and repeat it on both sides 4-5 times.
},
{
    667.44,671.76
     If you can do all these stretches with your knees locked out and your legs nice and straight
},
{
    671.76,676.48
     and you still don't feel a stretch, you can intensify the stretch by creating a pretension
},
{
    676.48,681.76
     stretch in your hamstrings by pointing your foot towards your face and creating dorsiflexion.
},
{
    681.76,686.64
     This also replicates an orthopedic test to aggravate the sciatic nerve.
},
{
    686.64,691.2
     So if you do feel pain and tingling running down from your lower back to your leg,
},
{
    691.2,697.84
     there could be a chance that you do have spinal stenosis or sciatica. So definitely go see a
},
{
    697.84,702.32
     professional. Once again, thanks for watching. If you found that this video is helpful, I highly

     That video will definitely help you out for any side cut symptoms.
},
{
    709.2,712.12
     If you do have side cut, there's a chance that you have tight lower back muscles as
