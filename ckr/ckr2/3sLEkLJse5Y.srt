     Hello and welcome to today's video. My name is Leon from backintelligence.com
},
{
    4.04,10.88
     where we help people fix their postures as well as help them ease their back pains from home using natural methods and
},
{
    11.04,14.34
     Today we're gonna be showing you how to use this bad boy
},
{
    14.56,20.68
     So if you're trying to fix your rounded shoulders or you just have very stiff shoulders or you have very tight pecs
},
{
    20.72,24.72
     You know putting you into this rounded shoulder position and all that kind of stuff
},
{
    24.72,25.36
     And you don't have a lot of mobility in your thoracic spine tight pecs, you know, putting you into this rounded shoulder position and all that kind of stuff.
},
{
    25.36,28.24
     And you don't have a lot of mobility in your thoracic spine.
},
{
    28.24,33.6
     We always, you know, obviously tell people that you need to release the chest muscles,
},
{
    33.6,36.44
     the shoulders, get mobility in there.
},
{
    36.44,41.24
     So what I'm going to show you right now is an exercise that you can do daily and you
},
{
    41.24,45.32
     can do it as many times as you want to open up your chest
},
{
    45.32,50.16
     and shoulder area. Okay and it's using this band right here. Now a lot of people
},
{
    50.16,59.32
     show this exercise using a wooden you know stick or a broomstick okay but I
},
{
    59.32,63.56
     recommend you use this band because it gives a little bit of a leeway right.
},
{
    63.56,69.38
     It's you don't want to be like all stiff and trying to use a wooden stick.
},
{
    69.38,75.08
     It's much better to use an elastic band like this, a resistance band like this, okay?
},
{
    75.08,80.36
     Now let me pull in my shirt in because nobody needs to see my belly button.
},
{
    80.36,82.8
     Trying to keep it professional here, folks.
},
{
    82.8,89.68
     And then all you do is just grab a band like this, stand in front of you and just pull it
},
{
    89.68,90.68
     all the way back.
},
{
    90.68,95.6
     Okay, so you're giving some mobility to your shoulders.
},
{
    95.6,96.6
     Hopefully you can see that.
},
{
    96.6,100.24
     I'll turn around in a few angles.
},
{
    100.24,101.48
     That's all you're doing.
},
{
    101.48,107.52
     So as you get here and as it starts to come up and go behind you, that's where the tension
},
{
    107.52,111.16
     really starts and it's a lot harder.
},
{
    111.16,115.08
     But because the band gives a little bit, it's perfectly okay.
},
{
    115.08,116.08
     Yes?
},
{
    116.08,121.24
     And just bring it all the way down and then bring it the other way.
},
{
    121.24,122.24
     That's all you're doing.
},
{
    122.24,128.92
     You're just going up and over. Yeah, so you should feel
},
{
    128.92,138.36
     all this open up, okay? Let me turn around, you can see it from the back. This is good
},
{
    138.36,145.0
     even when you're watching TV. Yeah, just knock 30 of these, no problem, right?
},
{
    145.0,147.44
     Now, a few tips.
},
{
    147.44,149.48
     First thing is you don't want to be shrugging your shoulders.
},
{
    149.48,153.48
     So if you're doing this, that's no good.
},
{
    153.48,157.34
     You're not going to feel much of your chest opening up, okay?
},
{
    157.34,161.56
     So shoulders down the whole time when you're doing this.
},
{
    161.56,168.4
     Secondly, you don't want to arch your low back and let your stomach out. So
},
{
    168.4,176.08
     this is the wrong way. If I don't... Look at my nice beer belly. Oh yeah. What's going
},
{
    176.08,180.64
     to happen is you're going to put strain on your low back over here and people start doing
},
{
    180.64,185.64
     that. That's no good either. You're trying to get mobility just in the shoulders
},
{
    185.64,188.9
     and chest area, okay, not in your low back.
},
{
    188.9,190.62
     So very important, keep that in mind.
},
{
    190.62,193.18
     The other thing is don't grab it too tightly.
},
{
    193.18,195.28
     So if you grab it too tightly like this
},
{
    195.28,198.28
     and you're trying to do it, you have to contort yourself
},
{
    198.28,199.6
     to be able to get through it.
},
{
    199.6,201.84
     So that's not good either, okay?
},
{
    201.84,207.16
     So make sure it's comfortable, but just a little bit challenging, okay?
},
{
    207.16,211.4
     But not too challenging that you cannot do it in proper form, okay?
},
{
    211.4,217.0
     So again, grab it like this and you can find out which elastic band works for you.
},
{
    217.0,218.92
     And let me show you here from the side.
},
{
    218.92,224.52
     Pull your stomach in, stretch up, tuck your chin in, now go to work.
},
{
    224.52,227.32
     Okay? Stretch up tuck your chin in now go to work. Okay, make sure you're doing good reps
},
{
    229.4,230.9
     And
},
{
    230.9,234.78
     Yeah, you don't need your hands to be almost touching each other
},
{
    234.78,238.56
     That's not the point the point is to get some mobility to open it up
},
{
    238.56,244.0
     And it's about consistently doing this day in and day out that's going to you know
},
{
    244.28,245.84
     Give you those results
},
{
    245.84,251.44
     okay it's not about just doing it once and doing it the hardest that you can so
},
{
    251.44,259.04
     again that's all you're doing and I do this daily and again you can do about
},
{
    259.04,265.6
     20 or 30 rap reps of this, no problem.
},
{
    265.6,271.32
