     In this video, I'm going to show you and demonstrate to you the most effective exercises you can do for a shoulder impingement and a shoulder pain.
},
{
    9.0,18.0
     One of these exercises I'm going to demonstrate to you has got a 98% success rate, which is literally unheard of when it comes to shoulder impingements.
},
{
    18.0,29.48
     Now, in order for you to understand why you got the shoulder impingement in the first place and how you can prevent it in the future. I'm going to answer three questions for you. The first one is why did
},
{
    29.48,34.34
     you get your shoulder impingement? Two is what can you do about it? And three is how
},
{
    34.34,39.7
     can you prevent this in the future? So in order for me to achieve this, what I'll do
},
{
    39.7,43.9
     in this video is I'll do a little bit of basic anatomy, not too long, but it helps you to
},
{
    43.9,49.68
     understand what a shoulder impingement is and why these exercises work. I'm going to run two really
},
{
    49.68,56.52
     quick tests by you. You can do at home, which will help to identify the cause of your shoulder
},
{
    56.52,60.6
     problem to make sure it is an impingement so that the exercises will be beneficial and
},
{
    60.6,65.62
     effective for you. I'm going to cyfnod sy'n 98%
},
{
    65.62,90.08
     ac mae'n helpu i'r cyfnod sy'n gyfnod a'r cyfnod yn ymddangos i'r cyfnod. A'r gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gweithio'n gwe Okay, let's get started.
},
{
    93.68,96.32
     So this is an anatomical model of your right shoulder. This bone in front here is called the clavicle or the collar bone.
},
{
    96.32,99.36
     It bumps from the middle of your chest to the top of your shoulder.
},
{
    99.36,102.08
     This bone here is called the acromion on top.
},
{
    102.08,105.6
     It sits here and then you've got your upper arm that sits there.
},
{
    105.6,110.4
     So an impingement is where the tendon becomes entrapped in the space between the roof of your
},
{
    110.4,115.52
     shoulder or the acromion and the humerus in there. That's where the entrapment takes place.
},
{
    115.52,122.16
     Have a look at this video. Now what you can see is you can see the acromion, the humerus and the
},
{
    122.16,125.96
     subacromial space and see what happens if I raise my arm.
},
{
    125.96,131.36
     If I raise the arm the tendon becomes trapped in the subacromial space and
},
{
    131.36,136.96
     that's causing you pain and impingement. So the exercises I'm going to
},
{
    136.96,141.64
     demonstrate to you effectively increase the space in the subacromial space
},
{
    141.64,149.28
     thereby reducing the impingement on the tendon. First what we need to do is reduce the inflammation, so we'll go through that.
},
{
    149.28,155.04
     Secondly, we increase the space and we do this by hanging, that's 98% effective, very very good exercise.
},
{
    155.04,158.94
     The third thing I'm going to demonstrate to you is some really effective exercises
},
{
    158.94,161.98
     which will help to prevent impingement in the future.
},
{
    161.98,166.04
     So here are some two really quick tests you can do to see if your shoulder pain is caused by a shoulder impingement in the future. So here are some two really quick tests you can do
},
{
    166.04,170.28
     to see if your shoulder pain is caused by a shoulder impingement. The first thing you
},
{
    170.28,175.24
     need to do is raise the arm, head of you raise it up to 90 degrees, then go about out to
},
{
    175.24,179.88
     about 30 degrees, thumb facing the ceiling, then you turn your hand around, thumb facing
},
{
    179.88,183.92
     down and now with the other hand we're going to apply pressure on this arm, push it down,
},
{
    183.92,187.44
     resist it with the affected arm and if this causes you a pain in the shoulder
},
{
    187.44,192.54
     you're struggling with an impingement. The second test you can do is
},
{
    192.54,198.24
     raise the arm to the side up to 90 degrees, bend the elbow, bring it across in front
},
{
    198.24,202.72
     of your chest, with the other hand I'm going to place my hand here on the elbow
},
{
    202.72,207.84
     and my elbow on the hand, I'm going to rotate my arm down, turn it down, I'm going to put place my hand here on the elbow and my elbow on the hand. I'm going to rotate my arm down, turn it down.
},
{
    207.88,210.84
     I'm going to bring the arm, the affected arm across the chest even more.
},
{
    211.2,214.6
     Now, if this causes you a pain in the shoulder, you're dealing with a shoulder
},
{
    214.6,218.68
     impingement and the exercises I'm going to demonstrate to you are going to be
},
{
    218.68,220.48
     very, very beneficial for you indeed.
},
{
    221.16,226.12
     So the number one exercise for a shoulder impingement is actually a two
},
{
    226.12,232.2
     parter, it is hanging and some really really specific exercises and as I said
},
{
    232.2,237.6
     before this exercise has got a 98% success rate which is actually unheard
},
{
    237.6,241.44
     of. What I'm going to demonstrate to you is actually based on this book it's
},
{
    241.44,244.52
     called Shoulder Pain by an author called John Kiersch which is an orthopedic
},
{
    244.52,246.72
     surgeon in America so if you want some additional
},
{
    246.72,251.16
     information just buy this book online or wherever you want to buy it.
},
{
    251.16,255.48
     There are two conditions before you start this exercise. Firstly you need to be
},
{
    255.48,261.12
     able to raise your arm up to 90 degrees relatively pain-free and secondly if you
},
{
    261.12,265.4
     had a history of dislocating your shoulders or very brittle bones, you
},
{
    265.4,271.4
     might want to get some medical advice first before you start doing these exercises.
},
{
    271.4,275.5
     So you need to find yourself a beam or something to hang from.
},
{
    275.5,278.44
     Make sure your hand palms face away from you.
},
{
    278.44,280.48
     The ultimate goal is to hang loose.
},
{
    280.48,282.72
     It might be a little bit sore initially.
},
{
    282.72,289.44
     This whole thing might be a little bit counter-intuitive, but please bear with me and try to go through it if you can. So we do a partial hang first,
},
{
    289.44,296.4
     so a hand palms away from me, partial hang, and I'm going to hang just like this for 10, 20 or 30
},
{
    296.4,301.92
     seconds. The ultimate goal is to hang loose, but if you can't, just support yourself with your legs.
},
{
    301.92,306.64
     Then after 10, 20, 30 seconds, you give yourself about a minute break
},
{
    306.64,308.82
     and then you repeat it again.
},
{
    308.82,312.34
     And you do this for about 10 to 15 minutes a day.
},
{
    313.5,318.5
     Now, if you can raise your arm above 90 degrees
},
{
    320.0,322.26
     without any pain, that's when you move on,
},
{
    322.26,323.92
     straight away you move on to the second part
},
{
    323.92,326.8
     of this exercise, which is coming up now.
},
{
    326.8,330.96
     So this is part two of the hanging exercise.
},
{
    330.96,334.04
     Again, the condition is that you're able to raise your arm
},
{
    334.04,336.98
     above 90 degrees without pain,
},
{
    336.98,338.76
     and these exercises should be performed
},
{
    338.76,341.6
     straight after you've done the hanging.
},
{
    341.6,343.9
     You need some weights for this exercise.
},
{
    343.9,346.32
     Light weights though, range from 1 to 8 pounds.
},
{
    346.84,351.44
     You're allowed to increase the weight during the exercises, but only if you can perform
},
{
    351.96,354.56
     30 to 45 repetitions of all the exercises,
},
{
    355.44,361.32
     pain-free, that's when you're allowed to increase the weights. So there's three movements that we're going to
},
{
    362.44,364.04
     that we're going to perform.
},
{
    364.04,365.88
     The first movement is make sure your hand palms are facing down and we're going to perform. The first movement is make sure your
},
{
    365.88,369.36
     hand palms are facing down and we're going to go sideways all the way up,
},
{
    369.36,373.44
     hand palms facing down. We need to do full range of motion so the weights and
},
{
    373.44,378.44
     the hands touch above our head and we come down again. So again 30 to 45
},
{
    378.44,382.32
     repetitions of this elbow straight. Make sure you're nice and upright, nice and
},
{
    382.32,385.2
     straight. Don't do this with a slouch posture,
},
{
    385.2,391.28
     that will make things even worse, nice and upright and all the way up there. So 30-45 repetitions
},
{
    391.28,396.32
     of this one, then straight after you're doing hand palms facing down and you're going forward,
},
{
    397.2,402.88
     yeah as you can see my hand palms are facing down, you're going in front of you and raise it all the way,
},
{
    403.68,405.12
     there you are above your head.
},
{
    405.12,407.56
     Again, 30, 45 repetitions of this one.
},
{
    407.56,409.78
     And the last one, again, look at my hands,
},
{
    409.78,412.44
     hand palms facing down, and you move your weight backwards,
},
{
    412.44,415.2
     and you come forward, and you move your weight backwards,
},
{
    415.2,419.56
     and forward again, 30 to 45 repetitions of this one.
},
{
    419.56,423.12
     So that's this second exercise completed.
},
{
    423.12,429.68
     Now I'm going to move on to some more specific exercises and they will help you to prevent
},
{
    429.68,432.96
     an shoulder impingement in the future.
},
{
    432.96,437.48
     So the next two exercises that we're going to show you are going to help with the impingement
},
{
    437.48,442.32
     but more importantly they also help to prevent it coming back in the future.
},
{
    442.32,446.2
     And what I love about these two exercises is they work on muscles,
},
{
    446.2,449.4
     which depress as in pull away the upper arm
},
{
    449.4,451.08
     from the roof of the shoulder.
},
{
    451.08,453.68
     So they increase the space where the tendon runs through
},
{
    453.68,456.4
     so you have less chance of an impingement.
},
{
    456.4,459.16
     Okay, the first exercise is we're going to exercise
},
{
    459.16,461.12
     a muscle called infraspinatus.
},
{
    461.12,462.12
     I'm sure you've seen this before.
},
{
    462.12,468.04
     You do need a little bit of a terror band for this one here.. You need to be make sure you're upright. Don't do the
},
{
    468.04,471.4
     exercise slouch. Make sure you're upright. Thumb towards the ceiling. Elbow
},
{
    471.4,476.36
     needs to be at all times touching your side upright and all you do now is you
},
{
    476.36,481.8
     rotate, you turn your arm out like that and make sure you're upright. And you do
},
{
    481.8,487.04
     this 10 repetitions. You do three sets once a day, 15 repetitions max.
},
{
    487.04,493.92
     So that's the first exercise that you need to do. So this final exercise is a specific exercise for
},
{
    493.92,499.28
     two muscles called the teres major and the latissimus dorsi and both those muscles play an important
},
{
    499.28,508.82
     role in pulling the upper arm away from the roof of the shoulder thereby increasing that space where the impingement normally takes place. So you need again one of these
},
{
    508.82,516.0
     terror bands. So grab the terror band facing away from you and your thumb away
},
{
    516.0,520.16
     from you. You turn the hand so the thumb faces towards you and the hand is a
},
{
    520.16,524.2
     little bit in front of you. Make sure the elbow is nice and straight and now what
},
{
    524.2,530.28
     you do is you pull this band from front a little bit too behind you. Keep your elbow
},
{
    530.28,536.24
     straight make sure you have an upright posture when you're doing this and do 10 repetitions,
},
{
    536.24,543.6
     15 repetitions and repeat this three times. So I hope you found a lot of value in this
