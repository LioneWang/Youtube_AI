     You know at some point in time most of us are going to incur some type of sprain or strain injury to our bodies.

     Hi, I'm Captain Joe Bruni and what we're going to discuss and go over is how to treat a foot sprain.
},
{
    12.0,20.0
     A foot sprain is damaged to the ligaments that occurs in the arch underneath area of the foot.
},
{
    20.0,27.0
     To properly treat that area, have the patient lie down and elevate the foot to at least
},
{
    27.0,35.0
     the chest height or slightly higher to reduce blood flow. Apply some type of cold commercial
},
{
    35.08,41.68
     ice pack or ice itself to the injured area to reduce pain and swelling. If using ice
},
{
    41.68,52.0
     or cold pad, you may want to use some type of cloth material so that ice pack or that ice itself is not up against the skin which could cause a cold burn injury.
},
{
    52.0,66.0
     After 10 to 15 minutes, remove the ice and wrap the area with some type of pressure bandage to help support the foot and to reduce the pain and discomfort.
},
{
    66.0,73.0
     The pressure bandage may have to be worn for several days as the person nurses themselves back to health
},
{
    73.0,81.0
     and they try to walk on the foot as the pressure bandage will provide support to the arch area of the foot.
},
{
    81.0,87.26
     Strains and sprains can be a pretty painful experience, but with proper treatment, things
},
{
    87.26,88.86
     can go quite well.
},
{
    88.86,95.12
     After 48 hours, apply heat to the area to increase blood flow and dilate the blood vessels,
},
{
    95.12,97.42
     which will promote a faster healing time.
},
{
    97.42,100.28
     I'm Captain Joe Bruni, stay safe and we'll see you next time.
