     Hey everybody it's Dr. Jo and today I'm going to show you five ways to relieve a sore back.
},
{
    4.24,5.28
     So let's get started.
},
{
    13.12,17.12
     So before we get started if you haven't already make sure and click on the subscribe button down
},
{
    17.12,22.48
     there because it helps my channel grow. So when you have a sore back just kind of like I did a
},
{
    22.48,29.4
     couple days ago when I was moving a whole lot of rocks working in my yard, one of the great ones that's one of my favorites
},
{
    29.4,30.6
     is a pelvic tilt.
},
{
    30.6,32.04
     This really helps loosen up the back.
},
{
    32.04,37.28
     So if your back is sore, you have some sore muscles, this is a way to get some relaxation
},
{
    37.28,39.16
     without doing a whole lot of movement.
},
{
    39.16,43.08
     So a pelvic tilt when you're lying down is really just how it sounds.
},
{
    43.08,45.76
     You're tilting your pelvis area,
},
{
    45.76,53.84
     but you're not using your legs to push down. You're using your pelvis and rotating or tilting
},
{
    53.84,58.08
     it back almost where you're flattening out your back. So just kind of imagine that you're taking
},
{
    58.08,64.16
     that belly button and pushing it down into wherever you're lying down. So if you feel like you're
},
{
    64.16,65.52
     pushing a lot with your feet,
},
{
    65.52,67.68
     like maybe if your bottom's coming up a little bit,
},
{
    67.68,68.52
     that's too much.
},
{
    68.52,72.78
     You really wanna use your core muscles to get that tilt.
},
{
    72.78,75.94
     So watch here where I'm tilting back.
},
{
    75.94,77.68
     Everything's kind of flattening out.
},
{
    77.68,78.8
     You're not holding your breath,
},
{
    78.8,80.4
     you're breathing nice and easily.
},
{
    80.4,83.88
     Hold it for about three to five seconds and then relax.
},
{
    83.88,85.44
     So if you're really sore
},
{
    85.44,88.92
     you're gonna feel this even though it doesn't feel like a big movement but
},
{
    88.92,91.36
     you're gonna feel that little stretch in the back and that's what you want to
},
{
    91.36,94.84
     feel just kind of getting some movement in those muscles to help loosen them up
},
{
    94.84,98.68
     a little bit. So just maybe starting off with five to ten nothing big just
},
{
    98.68,103.32
     getting it nice and loosened up. So the next one is going to be going into a
},
{
    103.32,106.8
     bridge which is more than that pelvic tilt.
},
{
    106.8,113.68
     So now you are using your legs. When you come up into a bridge really come up one segment at a time
},
{
    113.68,118.32
     of your back. This is going to really help again loosen everything up, get those sore muscles
},
{
    118.32,123.6
     worked out a little bit to help make them feel a little bit better. But drive your knees forward so
},
{
    123.6,128.18
     you're not just lifting your bottom up. You're really coming up one segment at a time.
},
{
    128.18,132.54
     Kind of almost like you're pushing your knees up and away from you. Try and get
},
{
    132.54,136.98
     in as much into a straight line as you can. If you're really sore and you can
},
{
    136.98,141.46
     only come to here that's okay. But just a little pause at the top and then a nice
},
{
    141.46,145.48
     roll back down. So rolling up, getting that nice
},
{
    145.48,152.16
     stretch in there and then really slowly rolling back down. So I really like the
},
{
    152.16,155.56
     bridges not only because it helps loosen up that back but it's also a
},
{
    155.56,159.44
     strengthening exercise as well. It works your hamstrings and your glutes and if
},
{
    159.44,163.12
     you've got a sore back those are muscles you really want to work out as well. So
},
{
    163.12,170.56
     really coming up, getting that nice stretch, just to pause at the top and then rolling back down. Another
},
{
    170.56,174.76
     great way to relieve muscle soreness in your back or soreness in general is using
},
{
    174.76,178.68
     a pain relieving gel. And the folks at Capsiva sent me their pain relieving gel.
},
{
    178.68,184.44
     It has capsaicin in it and capsaicin is the one that that heat that you feel is
},
{
    184.44,185.36
     the natural pain
},
{
    185.36,190.48
     reliever sometimes that you get from hot peppers. Some some of the gels that you might get like at
},
{
    190.48,198.08
     the store it heats up the area but sometimes at least for me I have very sensitive skin that
},
{
    198.08,203.68
     capsaicin actually irritates my skin sometimes and so what's really great about the capsaiva is
},
{
    203.68,210.44
     they've discovered a way to give you more of that capsaicin without that heat component. And so it does a really
},
{
    210.44,216.36
     good job of helping to relieve that pain, kind of block that signal going to the brain,
},
{
    216.36,220.6
     but also increasing the blood flow through the area, which helps the healing process.
},
{
    220.6,224.84
     And it doesn't have much of a scent to it. Some of the gels and stuff, you know, they're
},
{
    224.84,225.12
     pretty strong. And so I like that as well, because you. Some of the gels and stuff, you know, they're pretty
},
{
    225.12,229.92
     strong and so I like that as well because you know you can put it on, you know, just nice and rub it
},
{
    229.92,235.36
     all over your back into the area. It doesn't have to be exact. And then once you get it in there,
},
{
    235.36,240.24
     since it is a capsaicin component to it, make sure you wash your hands afterwards. So I'm going to do
},
{
    240.24,249.68
     that before I go back into everything. But again, it's really nice. You can use it for arthritis. You can use it for headaches. You can even use it for sunburns because
},
{
    249.68,254.08
     it doesn't have that heating up component. It helps relieve that pain. So there's a lot
},
{
    254.08,258.24
     of different things you can use it for. But I found, like I said, when I was lifting all
},
{
    258.24,263.72
     those rocks, I had 112 bags, 50 pounds each, working and moving those in the yard. And
},
{
    263.72,266.2
     this really helped afterwards with that soreness
},
{
    266.2,268.7
     and that backing of those muscles were really tired,
},
{
    268.7,270.8
     really worked and this helped kind of calm it down.
},
{
    270.8,273.12
     So I could do those stretches and exercises
},
{
    273.12,274.92
     to help relieve that pain.
},
{
    274.92,276.64
     Got my hands all washed.
},
{
    276.64,280.08
     So now we're gonna go into a single knee to chest stretch.
},
{
    280.08,281.56
     And it's just like it sounds,
},
{
    281.56,284.22
     you're bringing your knee up towards your chest.
},
{
    284.22,286.44
     If you have any knee issues, I suggest grabbing underneath and like it sounds. You're bringing your knee up towards your chest. If you have any knee issues,
},
{
    286.44,289.4
     I suggest grabbing underneath and bringing it up.
},
{
    289.4,292.2
     But if you don't, some people like to grab right here,
},
{
    292.2,294.92
     but that just puts a little pressure on your knee.
},
{
    294.92,297.76
     Now, some people like to put their other leg
},
{
    297.76,299.52
     all the way down, which will help get you
},
{
    299.52,302.1
     a hip flexor stretch a little bit on the other side.
},
{
    302.1,304.36
     I personally, especially if you have a sore back,
},
{
    304.36,305.36
     like to bend my knee up,
},
{
    305.36,307.36
     because that takes that pressure off the back.
},
{
    307.36,310.44
     So when you bring your knee up, you're relaxed,
},
{
    310.44,312.1
     you're not actively bringing it up,
},
{
    312.1,314.28
     you're using your hands to bring it up.
},
{
    314.28,316.04
     And so as you come up,
},
{
    316.04,317.92
     just go as far as you comfortably can,
},
{
    317.92,320.64
     and you should feel a little stretch in that low back area.
},
{
    320.64,324.64
     So this is a nice stretch to get that soreness out of there.
},
{
    324.64,325.12
     So this is gonna be a full stretch that soreness out of there. So this is
},
{
    325.12,330.5
     going to be a full stretch which is the 30-second stretch. After you've held that
},
{
    330.5,335.48
     for 30 seconds, I like to alternate sides. You don't have to. You can do three on
},
{
    335.48,339.04
     one side and then switch and do three on the other side. But I like to alternate
},
{
    339.04,344.64
     back and forth, but it's going to be 30 seconds each side three times. So after
},
{
    344.64,345.28
     you get that nice
},
{
    345.28,349.4
     stretch in there and again you can hold underneath there if you want to if
},
{
    349.4,353.4
     you're getting a little pinch in the groin area which some people do just
},
{
    353.4,357.96
     bring it back a little bit or again then slide that leg down so then you won't
},
{
    357.96,361.92
     have to pull it quite as much to get that stretch in there. And then so the last
},
{
    361.92,369.24
     one is just going to be a trunk rotation. And so I really like the trunk rotation because that gets the side of the back a little bit.
},
{
    369.24,373.28
     So when you've got a lot of muscle soreness in the back, it's not always just going to
},
{
    373.28,377.72
     be in the middle part of the back. Sometimes it comes around to the sides as well. So this
},
{
    377.72,381.64
     one's really nice to get the stretch on the sides as well as the back area. You're just
},
{
    381.64,388.16
     going to slide everything together, slide your feet together, slide your knees together, and then you're just going to gently roll over to the
},
{
    388.16,393.2
     side. Your hips can come up, but you don't want your shoulders to come up. You want the
},
{
    393.2,397.76
     top part of your body to be nice and relaxed, and you'll get a little stretch through the
},
{
    397.76,403.44
     side there. Now this one you can either kind of do it as an exercise with a little pause
},
{
    403.44,405.08
     of maybe five seconds or so
},
{
    405.08,409.04
     on each side or you can do that full stretch. If you're really sore, I recommend
},
{
    409.04,412.84
     doing that full 30 second stretch and just kind of relaxing and let everything
},
{
    412.84,417.96
     get stretched out and then rotate back to the other side. So I'm a little blocked
},
{
    417.96,422.0
     by the futon there but I can slide just a little bit and again you should feel
},
{
    422.0,426.4
     that stretch kind of through the side. You might feel it all the way up a little bit, but I feel mine
},
{
    426.4,430.6
     the most kind of on the side in that low back area where I really am sore and
},
{
    430.6,434.88
     want to feel that stretch. So again, 30 seconds on each side. So there you have it.
},
{
    434.88,438.36
     That was five ways to relieve a sore back. If you'd like to purchase the Capsiva
