     Bob and Brad, the two most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    9.04,11.04
     Come on down
},
{
    11.08,16.72
     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist, Brad Heineck physical therapist, because we are the most famous physical therapists on the internet
},
{
    16.72,22.64
     In our opinion, of course Bob, how to cure your shoulder tendonitis, bursitis or impingement
},
{
    23.04,25.76
     You're gonna talk about what the ituses are, aren't you Brad?
},
{
    25.76,30.8
     Yeah, this is the education of the itus today and it won't be so
},
{
    31.36,33.36
     scary to you anymore after that.
},
{
    33.36,37.28
     Well, I'm glad that you think that Brad because I am kind of frightened over this.
},
{
    37.28,41.28
     Well Bob, I thought you were leaving the show. What was I gonna do by myself?
},
{
    41.28,44.64
     We don't have a camera person here today, so we're handling this our own.
},
{
    44.64,47.54
     I just flipped the screen around so we can take a look at ourselves while we're doing this
},
{
    47.54,50.96
     By the way, let's take care of this Pat, in case you are new to our channel
},
{
    51.08,52.92
     Please come on in the water is fine
},
{
    52.92,56.98
     We provide videos how to stay healthy fit pain-free and we upload every day so make sure you subscribe
},
{
    57.64,62.44
     Also if you haven't already go over to Facebook and like us because Brad and I as children
},
{
    62.6,66.68
     We're not liked and we are working very hard to turn things around and you can see
},
{
    66.72,72.98
     You just go to Bob and Brad on Facebook and that's where you'll find this heightened. I'm with the program
},
{
    72.98,80.94
     All right, he is with the program. Okay, so cure your shoulder pain tendonitis, bursitis, and pinchment. There's some really good news
},
{
    82.28,85.84
     Typically as therapists regardless of which one of
},
{
    85.84,90.24
     those you have, oftentimes the exercises, the primary treatment is going to be
},
{
    90.24,96.38
     very similar, so that makes it much easier. Part of the problem is Brad,
},
{
    96.38,101.24
     that impingement often causes tendonitis and bursitis, so if we can
},
{
    101.24,106.6
     treat all three, it's all going gonna be very similar. They overlap and the treatment again
},
{
    106.72,113.1
     will do similar things and get progress one way or another. One thing you think about is tendonitis and bursitis
},
{
    113.5,120.54
     If you break those words apart into their components, we have a tendon and itis. Itis is Latin for
},
{
    121.52,129.56
     inflammation, so you got inflammation of the tendon. Bursitis, Bursa is a bursa sac, we have bursa sacs in our shoulder and our knees and our hips
},
{
    129.86,134.3
     Fluid filled sac that helps the bone or the muscle rub over the bone right or the tendon
},
{
    134.3,136.3
     The tendon, it's a lubrication system
},
{
    136.54,139.72
     So your bursa sac has got inflammation and
},
{
    140.74,143.18
     Impingement means where the two bones come together
},
{
    143.58,152.06
     They actually, their shoulders not working properly and it pinches some tissues typically it's a tendon and then that tendon gets inflamed
},
{
    152.06,155.0
     Causing tendonitis, there you go, we're on the circle
},
{
    155.0,157.0
     Yep, it all revolves around
},
{
    157.2,159.96
     Shoulder pain, so I hope you feel better about that now
},
{
    160.04,164.48
     So how are we gonna treat it? The very first thing if it's all inflamed, it's tender sore
},
{
    164.68,169.78
     We're gonna get the cold pack out. So you know it doesn't matter what you use for a cold pack
},
{
    169.78,174.12
     You can have a bought one you can make your own and we did a video on how to make your own years ago
},
{
    174.12,175.92
     It's been a while since we did that. Yeah it is
},
{
    175.92,180.76
     But you know I think you actually got two of mine there so you can go Bob and Brad cold pack make your own
},
{
    180.76,182.76
     Let's see you put it on me because
},
{
    182.76,187.82
     That makes you a black shirt. Yeah, but I got a blue one here for mine, so I'm gonna freeze as well Bob
},
{
    187.82,193.58
     Actually, it'll feel real good on a sore shoulder. Yeah, it will. Yeah, and you put it on for 15 to 20 minutes
},
{
    193.58,199.42
     And that'll really calm it down. You could take a bag of peas too. Yeah frozen peas, not warm ones
},
{
    201.82,207.88
     Okay, so get the coal pack on there and typically the first range of motion exercise and oftentimes
},
{
    207.88,212.3
     You know we get referrals from the doctor on shoulder pain the doctor will say
},
{
    212.64,219.16
     Do the pendulum exercise until you see the therapist to get going on more and that's where you just bend over like this
},
{
    219.16,224.28
     I like to support so your back isn't getting stressed and just let that shoulder relax
},
{
    224.28,226.28
     You might hear it called Codmins too
},
{
    226.28,229.44
     That's the name of the doctor that invented it I believe in
},
{
    229.44,232.84
     Yeah, but I think it might have been a therapist, but the doctor took credit
},
{
    232.84,238.68
     I might get in trouble for saying that but that's all right. You can go right to left you can go forward and backwards
},
{
    238.68,242.92
     You can make circles this should feel like a nice relaxing
},
{
    243.48,246.08
     Exercise just to get it moving if you are going to therapy
},
{
    246.18,250.8
     You might want to see if they can do some phonophoresis on your aiontophoresis
},
{
    250.8,254.78
     It's just a way of calming it down by getting some medicine in the area
},
{
    254.78,258.88
     This is the ultrasound unit and this is keto-propan
},
{
    259.2,270.16
     It's a medicine that we use and we just go ahead and we put it on there and it helps Calm the inflammation down. So this is nothing more than ultrasound that therapists or chiropractors use it drives in the ketoprofen
},
{
    270.72,275.2
     Reduces the inflammation. It's a good way to start things to get it moving. All right
},
{
    276.08,282.6
     The next thing this is important because you can take three steps forward throughout the day doing the cold pack
},
{
    282.6,286.34
     The phonophoresis the codmins and if you go to bed at night
},
{
    286.34,292.32
     And you sleep on that shoulder without knowing it and you wake up laying on that side and it's all sore
},
{
    292.32,298.8
     You've just reversed a lot of what you've done. Physicianing is really important, especially at night. Bob
},
{
    298.8,305.12
     Shall we show them the canal? Yeah, we'll show them a couple things here Brad, actually the first one is
},
{
    306.16,312.16
     ideally try to not sleep on that shoulder, so you can do that one of two ways you can sleep on your back
},
{
    312.8,316.8
     and even when you're on your back and you're laying down like this you want to go ahead and take a pillow
},
{
    317.68,322.96
     and give that arm if this is the painful shoulder go ahead and give it some support, because it's down here
},
{
    322.96,326.28
     it's kind of a little bit extended and it's just not in a great position
},
{
    326.28,331.72
     If you haven't done this you'll be amazed at how nice that feels it lets that arm relax when it's relaxed
},
{
    331.72,337.6
     It circulates better better healing and make sure you experiment because it may take a little bit to figure out which position to put it
},
{
    337.6,340.56
     Maybe we like it down here. Maybe like it up here. All right
},
{
    340.56,345.6
     If you can also you could lay on let's say this is the painful shoulder now
},
{
    346.56,350.86
     Same thing here sometimes people fall asleep with it up here because it gives us support
},
{
    350.86,355.58
     But if you take two pillows one here and one here my voice just cracked Brad
},
{
    355.58,357.08
     Yeah, are you going through the chains?
},
{
    357.08,359.08
     I'm going through the chains
},
{
    359.08,363.38
     So we're gonna go ahead and stick it under here like that and that's gonna give it some good support
},
{
    363.78,367.12
     It takes two pillows, but you know it's worthwhile
},
{
    367.64,373.88
     Finding that extra pillow because it makes a difference now if you just insist and Brad was just talking about a patient
},
{
    373.88,377.88
     He had just this week right? Right. Well that was last week, but yeah
},
{
    377.96,380.2
     He always slept on his right side
},
{
    380.2,385.44
     He had a right shoulder problem and he said I could sleep on my back and in no matter what happens
},
{
    385.44,387.44
     I roll to my right side when I'm sleeping
},
{
    387.44,390.22
     So in that instance you want to go ahead and take another pillow
},
{
    390.22,392.72
     Maybe a full pillow or a throw pillow
},
{
    392.72,397.72
     I have a throw pillow in here on my bed permanently and I just create a little canal here
},
{
    397.72,402.56
     And you're gonna go ahead and lay in there and this helps take pressure off the shoulder
},
{
    402.6,406.82
     So now it's more on my head and my trunk
},
{
    406.82,411.0
     As opposed to the shoulder and even if you lean back a little bit like this
},
{
    411.0,416.2
     It even helps even more but now you're getting on more onto the shoulder blade instead of the point of the shoulder
},
{
    416.5,419.88
     Which really can give you a lot of pain. Now
},
{
    420.7,422.9
     Should we continue? Yeah, okay
},
{
    423.42,431.24
     So we got that tank here now the next thing is to start getting the shoulders strengthened with movement and the first thing is pretty subtle
},
{
    431.24,433.36
     But it's pretty important Bob and that's simple
},
{
    433.36,439.28
     Yeah, he wants to bring his shoulder blades together face this way a little bit more and see he's bringing the shoulder blades together
},
{
    439.44,443.12
     He's strengthening the core what we like to call the core of the shoulder
},
{
    443.12,445.66
     If this isn't strengthened in the right position
},
{
    446.02,450.94
     You're putting the shoulder in a bad position and it's gonna be more likely to impinge and it's gonna put
},
{
    451.1,456.7
     Which is also gonna cause more inflammation. So we're just doing scapular retraction
},
{
    456.7,459.82
     You can do this throughout the day. You can do this every hour if you'd like
},
{
    459.82,464.46
     You can just go ahead and rip off like 15 of them and squeeze those shoulder blades together
},
{
    464.82,468.16
     People are always amazed what a difference that this one exercise makes
},
{
    468.16,473.04
     Right now if that's working well then oftentimes we'll add some resistance on there
},
{
    473.84,476.92
     I'm gonna go ahead and grab the camera here Brad
},
{
    476.92,483.1
     So typically if you go to therapy, they'll give you some some stretch band at home
},
{
    483.1,484.8
     It's nice to buy the tubing ones
},
{
    484.8,485.34
     We like the
},
{
    485.34,489.24
     sink band because they're good quality and you know you got to find some place
},
{
    489.24,493.08
     to put the band you can put around a doorknob or whatever a kitchen door
},
{
    493.08,498.0
     we've got a nice wall anchor here that we do have and they work very well yeah
},
{
    498.0,501.48
     if you want to make sure to take a look at our products down below in the
},
{
    501.48,506.0
     Amazon section and Barad and I designed the wall anchor and we found out
},
{
    506.0,509.62
     It's really worked well with people. Oh, we really find them helpful
},
{
    509.62,514.24
     You can see we got them all over the wall here, but here you can do at this level
},
{
    514.24,517.0
     You can go at this level getting different fibers
},
{
    517.62,523.28
     To work that scapula, so you have good mechanics and then you can go over the top like this
},
{
    523.28,524.78
     This is gonna be more advanced
},
{
    524.78,527.32
     This will probably be the last one you do down the road
},
{
    527.32,532.06
     Well, I like about the wall anchor Brad is you keep a band, you know on the wall like that
},
{
    532.06,534.84
     It's a reminder every time you go buy it to go ahead and do it
},
{
    534.84,540.12
     Yeah, it's just it and then you go right to this is like the golden exercise
},
{
    540.12,546.02
     The gold standard. Yeah, is that external rotation. I got my elbow in here
},
{
    546.02,550.28
     I'm doing external rotation and we're gonna do 10 to 15 of these and
},
{
    550.74,553.18
     Then you can turn around and do internal rotation
},
{
    553.68,559.86
     Which I'm gonna show from this side so you can see it and you're pulling in and the wall anchor makes it really nice
},
{
    559.86,562.02
     So it's efficient. You can go this way
},
{
    562.02,565.16
     You know if I always have patient do the other side too You might as well
},
{
    565.16,571.16
     It's very easy and then work this way and this way and then you can go right into your scapular retraction
},
{
    571.16,574.8
     It's all right there because very very easy to follow
},
{
    574.8,577.76
     If you don't have that I'm going to show you the option
},
{
    578.76,581.08
     Get yourself a weight
},
{
    581.08,587.6
     You don't need a weight actually especially if you got a weak shoulder you can just use a can of soup lay on your side
},
{
    588.52,590.12
     Make sure I'm not
},
{
    590.12,595.8
     Macking my mic and then you do the exact same motion and it works just fine works good
},
{
    596.48,601.32
     Especially as a starting point. Yeah, and again 10 to 15 reps when you get up to three sets
},
{
    601.4,607.28
     You know go to a bigger weight. Okay with and band you just step farther away from the wall
},
{
    608.52,609.84
     Okay
},
{
    609.84,613.96
     Well Bob, not then yet. Okay, wait, shall we cover the
},
{
    615.08,620.88
     Cross-friction massage? Sure. I've had this where people they get so far in the treatment and it's getting better
},
{
    620.88,627.2
     They can lift up and out to the side, but they're stuck a little bit and what we're gonna do is a cross friction massage
},
{
    627.56,632.12
     You take your fingers and you put them together you can cross my top of each other
},
{
    632.4,636.44
     Hold on a second Brad. I'm gonna go ahead to get it focusing on you. Okay. Yeah, okay go ahead
},
{
    636.44,639.44
     All right, and typically it's right here
},
{
    639.52,642.22
     You're gonna go over that find that sore spot where there's
},
{
    642.68,647.22
     There's scar tissue healing and we need to break it apart sometimes to get to that next level
},
{
    647.48,651.76
     And you're just gonna cross and you're gonna work it deep in back and forth
},
{
    652.16,655.3
     And you can do this for they say up to 20 minutes
},
{
    655.3,658.24
     But you'll never get that far because you'll wear your fingers out usually
},
{
    658.24,664.42
     You know three to five minutes at the very most and your fingers will be tired and we find that that's normally enough to do the job
},
{
    664.42,666.38
     Yeah, you might even do a couple times a day
},
{
    666.82,672.06
     If you're only doing a few minutes, right now the thing is if you go back and forth it'll hurt at first
},
{
    672.42,678.48
     But after 20 to 30 seconds it should start to feel good or a nummage if it continues to feel painful
},
{
    678.48,679.88
     It's not ready for it yet
},
{
    679.88,687.16
     Just stop and give it a few days get the cold pack back on it and you really may want to have your arms supported while you're doing that Brad
},
{
    687.16,689.56
     Right, I'd go ahead and put it up on a pillow
},
{
    689.56,690.8
     Yeah, that's a good point
},
{
    690.8,696.84
     So we're gonna work it like this and then go ahead and so it's relaxed and now you can get in there and do that cross-fibre massage
},
{
    697.56,699.32
     Precisely Bob
},
{
    699.32,702.88
     Let's show the next trick and this is the one that you're so good at sure
},
{
    703.88,708.0
     There's a lot of different ways you can do this you can go ahead and do it with a pole
},
{
    708.48,714.28
     or stick or a broomstick and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna actually I'm pushing down through the pole
},
{
    714.36,720.04
     Do you want to flip the camera Brad? Sure. So we are pushing down through the pole while I'm going back like this
},
{
    720.64,722.16
     So
},
{
    722.16,727.64
     I'll set the shoulder down into the socket and really it works well with impingement and tendonitis
},
{
    727.96,733.24
     And now this should feel it should not hurt and you want to go back as far as you can go
},
{
    733.32,737.84
     And I might even go back to this point here and walk back up again
},
{
    737.84,742.4
     You can also go a little bit like this. There you go. I'm pushing down the whole way
},
{
    742.4,744.4
     I'm pushing down while it comes back
},
{
    744.46,744.68
     There you go. I'm pushing down the whole way and I'm pushing down while it comes back
},
{
    749.4,752.38
     So you just make sure that you're using a dowel or a stick that doesn't slip You do it on carpet and it'll hold on the bottom
},
