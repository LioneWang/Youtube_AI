     Welcome back guys, today I'm going to show you some ankle mobility exercises that you
},
{
    8.84,13.04
     can do before you do your run or even when you do your squats especially if you find
},
{
    13.04,17.0
     the heels are lifting off when you're doing your squats or you're finding some pain or
},
{
    17.0,18.8
     stiffness when you're running.
},
{
    18.8,22.88
     So a great way to actually test for ankle mobility issues is if you do a squat test
},
{
    22.88,29.68
     and your heels lift off the floor it means that you actually have tight calf muscles or tight Achilles tendons. So if you squat down with like for example
},
{
    29.68,34.08
     a barbell and your ankle actually lifts off the floor, your heel actually lifts off the floor,
},
{
    34.08,38.72
     then you actually do need to do more flexibility exercises. Another one is to take your feet off
},
{
    38.72,43.12
     the floor and if you have to lean back to do that that means you actually have dorsiflexion
},
{
    43.12,45.52
     restrictions. So if you do this but you have to lean back to do so you actually have dorsiflexion restrictions. So if you do this,
},
{
    51.52,56.4
     but you have to lean back to do so, then you have dorsiflexion stiffness. This is an ankle dorsiflexion mobilization technique. First put a power band against a pole,
},
{
    56.4,60.8
     and then put your foot into it, and create some sort of tension by moving forward and squatting
},
{
    60.8,64.48
     down. So what happens is the band pulls the distal part of the tibia back, which is the
},
{
    64.48,68.08
     furthest part of your shin bone away from you. As you lean forward with the tension,
},
{
    68.08,72.8
     it creates this dorsiflexion against your foot and your ankle, and this creates ankle mobilization
},
{
    72.8,76.64
     in dorsiflexion, which is what you need when you do squats. What's even more important,
},
{
    76.64,81.84
     it's to start off back and forth and then lean side to side. Try to hold at the point of stretches
},
{
    81.84,89.62
     for about one or two seconds and then move to another point. Now this is a deep squat mobilization technique. Since you're in this position in a squatting position
},
{
    89.62,92.8
     It's a pretty good idea to put yourself in this position and stretch it out.
},
{
    92.8,96.1
     You'll always try to hold this position for about 30 seconds at first,
},
{
    96.22,99.34
     then try to get to one minute and at the end maybe in five minutes.
},
{
    99.34,103.46
     You might feel some pain in tingling, stop at that point and then relax and try it again later on.
},
{
    103.46,107.56
     Now if this is too easy for you, lean side to side in different angles and hold that
},
{
    107.56,110.24
     position for about 10 seconds and then move to another angle.
},
{
    110.24,113.48
     What's amazing is that my grandma can sit in this position and she does most of her
},
{
    113.48,115.2
     housework in this position as well.
},
{
    115.2,118.2
     And she has no low back pain or even hip pain whatsoever.
},
{
    118.2,122.6
     So this is a very good preventative exercise to prevent low back pain and hip pain.
},
{
    122.6,124.52
     This is foam rolling the calf muscle.
},
{
    124.52,127.12
     Just put your Achilles tendon on top of a foam roller
},
{
    127.12,128.88
     and then move up and down.
},
{
    128.88,130.4
     Now if you don't feel like anything's happening,
},
{
    130.4,132.28
     just put your other leg on top of that leg
},
{
    132.28,134.26
     and that adds more weight and more pressure
},
{
    134.26,136.84
     onto the tendon and the muscle and glide back and forth.
},
{
    136.84,138.16
     Now if you wanna work it even more
},
{
    138.16,140.0
     and create a myofascial release,
},
{
    140.0,142.04
     just dorsiflex the foot back and forth
},
{
    142.04,144.08
     and that creates active myofascial release
},
{
    144.08,146.26
     which is more effective over massage.
},
{
    146.26,147.64
     Remember to do both legs.
},
{
    147.64,148.96
     This relaxes the calf muscles
},
{
    148.96,150.56
     and therefore give you more range of motion
},
{
    150.56,151.4
     and dorsiflexion.
},
{
    151.4,152.8
     Do it for a minute on each leg
},
{
    152.8,154.56
     and then relax and do it three, four sets.
},
{
    154.56,156.96
     Now this is one of the best calf muscle stretches
},
{
    156.96,157.96
     that I do.
},
{
    157.96,159.28
     Just place the ball of your foot
},
{
    159.28,161.0
     against a wall or against a pole.
},
{
    161.0,163.32
     Lock out your knees and then lean into the wall
},
{
    163.32,168.8
     or lean into the pole with your chest. Now make sure your back is nice and straight as well. Hold this position for about a minute.
},
{
    168.8,172.0
     Now if you do feel pain and tingling in this leg, just back off a little bit.
},
{
    173.28,176.88
     Guys if you do have pain in your ankle or your feet, make sure you get it checked down and get
},
{
    176.88,180.96
     it treated properly. Now if you do have pain under your foot for example, the plantar fascia,
