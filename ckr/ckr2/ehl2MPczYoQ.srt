     In this demonstration I'm going to show you how to accurately measure wound dimensions
},
{
    13.48,17.4
     using this simulated wound model.
},
{
    17.4,25.82
     You will need a disposable single use paper ruler to do your wound dimensions. We will start with this wound as this is a
},
{
    25.82,33.04
     flat wound that's easily measurable. Take your paper ruler and place it on the
},
{
    33.04,38.72
     longest length of the wound remembering that that runs on the sagittal plane.
},
{
    38.72,45.92
     When you put your ruler against the wound you may need to move it several times in order to
},
{
    45.92,53.12
     ascertain the maximum length of the wound as this may not be in the centre.
},
{
    53.12,59.82
     In this case the longest length of the wound is 4.5 centimetres. Then we're
},
{
    59.82,71.88
     ready to measure the width of the wound remembering that that it runs on the transverse plane at 90 degrees to the length. Again we take our wound measuring

{
    71.88,80.46
     device and place it adjacent to the wound at the widest point. In this case
},
{
    80.46,85.0
     the width of the wound is 5.5 centimetres.
},
{
    85.52,89.2
     These can then be documented on your wound assessment chart.
