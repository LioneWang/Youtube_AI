     Summer is right around the corner and here in San Diego we are lucky enough to have
},
{
    12.16,15.04
     sunny days almost year-round.
},
{
    15.04,20.12
     Soaking up the rays is a common pastime in America's finest city but it can also be
},
{
    20.12,22.64
     dangerous when unprotected.
},
{
    22.64,26.88
     Today we are putting the spotlight on sunlight and talking
},
{
    26.88,34.04
     to Dr. Greg Daniels at UC San Diego Morse Cancer Center about skin cancer, the symptoms,
},
{
    34.04,40.96
     treatment options and how to prevent melanoma which is on the rise in the United States.
},
{
    40.96,43.4
     Thank you so much for being with us today Dr. Daniels.
},
{
    43.4,45.36
     You're welcome. Thank you for having me.
},
{
    45.36,48.16
     How does skin cancer develop?
},
{
    48.16,51.64
     Non-melanoma skin cancer is like basal cells and squamous cells.
},
{
    51.64,58.04
     Happen on their extremities, face, any place that we get a lot of chronic sun damage.
},
{
    58.04,63.96
     And so chronic just means the more sun exposure we get, the higher the risk.
},
{
    63.96,69.66
     Melanoma happens also in those areas, but on the trunk, on the legs, other places where
},
{
    69.66,76.9
     sun doesn't shine as constantly, even where the sun often never shines, because melanoma
},
{
    76.9,84.34
     can happen in the GI tract, as well as uncommon melanoma that's also in the eye.
},
{
    84.34,87.12
     What are the signs we should be looking for?
},
{
    87.12,90.28
     One is this is a spot that just doesn't look like anyplace
},
{
    90.28,91.28
     else on your body.
},
{
    91.28,95.72
     So we call that, more or less, the ugly duckling rule.
},
{
    95.72,99.8
     One that's just not like the others that looks bad.
},
{
    99.8,103.2
     The other characteristic you want to look for is changing.
},
{
    103.2,106.16
     So an area that's changing more than the rest of your body.
},
{
    106.16,111.64
     So we all have spots, we all have lumps that are relatively stable, but cancer generally
},
{
    111.64,112.64
     isn't.
},
{
    112.64,114.16
     And so it will continue to evolve and change.
},
{
    114.16,116.92
     So you're looking at those two factors.
},
{
    116.92,122.64
     Who is at risk for skin cancer and if diagnosed, what are the treatment options available?
},
{
    122.64,126.8
     Everybody at least is on the list of being at risk for skin cancer.
},
{
    126.8,131.36
     And when they see their physician, I encourage everybody to advocate for themselves.
},
{
    131.36,137.68
     A hundred years ago, the risk of melanoma was almost negligible, maybe one in a thousand,
},
{
    137.68,140.92
     one in five thousand kind of incidence rates.
},
{
    140.92,146.4
     Nowadays, it's one in 30 approaching that. So in the last hundred years, there's
},
{
    146.4,152.12
     been this dramatic increase in melanoma of skin cancers. There's risks that are intrinsic
},
{
    152.12,159.12
     to us, such as our susceptibility to other health problems. So if you have, say, chronic
},
{
    159.12,165.04
     lymphocytic leukemia, that's an immune suppressed kind of state. Those patients are at
},
{
    165.04,171.28
     increased risk for skin cancers or HIV infections and it's certainly related to
},
{
    171.28,177.14
     lifestyle. Whether it's tannin bed exposures or other ways that we're
},
{
    177.14,183.58
     relating to the sun, but it's not genetic. The best way to treat it is with
},
{
    183.58,185.32
     surgical excision.
},
{
    185.32,189.04
     Early detection means that you have a smaller scar
},
{
    189.04,192.6
     or sometimes you can treat very early non-millinomal
},
{
    192.6,196.04
     skin cancers with non-surgical techniques such as creams
},
{
    197.36,199.72
     or other kind of ablative techniques.
},
{
    200.6,203.44
     What are the best ways to protect ourselves?
},
{
    203.44,208.84
     If you have fair skin, you're at risk for a lot of UV damage, maybe you're outdoors
},
{
    208.84,212.88
     all the time, things like that, you want to protect yourself.
},
{
    212.88,216.96
     Everybody has their list of different protections that they believe in.
},
{
    216.96,222.2
     American Academy of Dermatology recommends avoiding sun between 10 and 2, wearing sun
},
{
    222.2,228.4
     protective clothing, applying sunscreens appropriately, which is often and lots.
},
{
    229.28,235.68
     For melanomas, it's a little more controversial as to what the best way to prevent the melanomas are.
},
{
    236.24,241.76
     So we apply some of the same rules of non-melanoma skin cancers, of sun moderation.
},
{
    242.4,245.56
     Just because it's a cloudy day doesn't mean the UV is away.
},
{
    245.56,247.52
     Where at risk we're getting sunburned
},
{
    247.52,250.24
     even in those conditions.
},
{
    250.24,253.28
     What should we be looking for when purchasing sunscreen?
},
{
    253.28,256.24
     What people should look for is something
},
{
    256.24,258.08
     that says broad spectrum.
},
{
    258.08,262.32
     And that implies that both UVA and UVB is being quieted.
},
{
    262.32,264.48
     And it depends on the organization.
},
{
    264.48,269.84
     If you're going to wear sunscreen, probably it's a 15 to a 30 that you want to apply.
},
{
    269.84,276.44
     One reason why the FDA kept the labeling at 50 is at about an SPF of 50, you're blocking
},
{
    276.44,281.08
     essentially 97, 98% of the UV that's out there.
},
{
    281.08,286.0
     So rather than say, oh, I'm good for the day because I have an SPF of 5,000, it's,
},
{
    286.0,291.12
     oh, it's a 50, and oh, yeah, the label says every two hours to reapply it.
},
{
    291.12,295.64
     And oh, it's not waterproof because that term doesn't exist anymore in the labeling.
},
{
    295.64,300.4
     It should say water resistant, but also give guidelines as to how often sunscreen or some
},
{
    300.4,301.4
     blocks reapplied.
},
{
    301.4,304.8
