{
    0.0,20.84
     If you have had recent surgery, you may have one or more incisions depending on the type
},
{
    20.84,23.08
     of surgery you have had.
},
{
    23.08,25.8
     After some surgeries, blood and normal body fluids
},
{
    25.8,27.96
     may collect in the surgical site,
},
{
    27.96,30.32
     which is also called the wound.
},
{
    30.32,32.04
     Fluids can build up at the site
},
{
    32.04,34.06
     and slow the healing process.
},
{
    34.06,36.78
     They may also interfere with your daily activities
},
{
    36.78,38.6
     and cause discomfort.
},
{
    38.6,41.14
     To avoid fluid buildup, your surgeon
},
{
    41.14,43.04
     may have inserted a flexible tube
},
{
    43.04,45.12
     into the surgical site during your surgery.
},
{
    45.12,50.84
     The drain allows fluid from the surgical site to drain into a reservoir that can be emptied.
},
{
    50.84,56.44
     In this video, you will learn the steps to care for your drain as well as the dressing covering
},
{
    56.44,72.52
     the area where the drain enters your skin. Your wound drainage system consists of tubing, also called a catheter or drain, and a reservoir
},
{
    72.52,76.12
     at the bottom of the tube, also called a bulb.
},
{
    76.12,81.48
     Throughout this video, the wound catheter is referred to as the drain, and the reservoir
},
{
    81.48,82.96
     as the bulb.
},
{
    82.96,86.68
     The drain tubing is placed inside the wound by your surgeon
},
{
    86.68,89.28
     and is secured to the skin outside of the wound
},
{
    89.28,91.52
     with a suture or stitch.
},
{
    91.52,93.48
     This area where the drain enters
},
{
    93.48,95.0
     and is stitched to your skin
},
{
    95.0,97.76
     is called the drain insertion site.
},
{
    97.76,100.12
     The bulb provides gentle suction,
},
{
    100.12,102.56
     which helps draw fluid from the wound site.
},
{
    104.92,107.42
     Two times a day, empty each bulb.
},
{
    108.72,111.62
     Measure the amount of fluid in each bulb separately
},
{
    111.62,114.58
     and record the amounts on a specific chart.
},
{
    114.58,116.54
     The amount you record on the chart
},
{
    116.54,118.78
     will determine when it's safe for your surgeon
},
{
    118.78,120.02
     to remove the drain.
},
{
    121.7,124.62
     There is a risk of infection at the incision site
},
{
    124.62,126.92
     and at the drain insertion site.
},
{
    126.92,132.3
     To avoid infection and help the healing process, it is important for you and your caregiver
},
{
    132.3,137.12
     to know the right method for cleaning and caring for your incision and drain.
},
{
    137.12,141.74
     This portion of the video shows you how to take care of your drain insertion site and
},
{
    141.74,145.36
     the specific dressing your surgeon has chosen for you.
},
{
    145.36,151.44
     You need to be aware of potential problems at the drain site and of any signs of infection.
},
{
    151.44,157.12
     It is important that you call the breast center if you notice any problems.
},
{
    157.12,161.52
     Before you are discharged, you are given a handout reviewing these instructions.
},
{
    161.52,166.16
     It has care instructions specific to your drains and surgical incisions. The
},
{
    166.16,176.4
     handout has phone numbers for you to call if you have concerns.
},
{
    176.4,181.14
     Your incision may be closed with stitches that dissolve on their own or stitches that need
},
{
    181.14,187.44
     to be removed by your surgeon at a later time. You may also have a dressing over your drain insertion site.
},
{
    187.44,190.96
     There are many types of dressings used to cover incisions.
},
{
    190.96,196.56
     The type of dressing you have on your incision may be different from what is shown in this video.
},
{
    196.56,201.36
     You will receive separate written instructions on how to care for your incision and dressing.
},
{
    202.64,207.96
     It is normal to have a little bit of swelling around each stitch along your incision.
},
{
    207.96,213.2
     It is also normal to have a little bit of swelling around each drain insertion site.
},
{
    213.2,217.2
     This mild swelling may last for a few days after surgery.
},
{
    217.2,222.72
     It is also normal to have some oozing of clear, yellowish fluid with a small amount of blood
},
{
    222.72,230.4
     from the incision and around the drain insertion site. You may feel some tenderness in these areas.
},
{
    234.56,240.1
     The fluid in the bulb right after surgery is red. This is normal because the
},
{
    240.1,246.72
     fluid contains some blood cells. It becomes less red over time.
},
{
    246.72,252.48
     It usually becomes a clear yellow or cloudy fluid with occasional small red blood clots
},
{
    252.48,254.66
     or pink fibrous tissue.
},
{
    254.66,259.18
     This is a normal part of the healing process.
},
{
    259.18,264.18
     Call the breast center right away if the fluid in your bulb becomes bright red with clots
},
{
    264.18,269.56
     or milky white in color. Also call the breast center right away if you measure more
},
{
    269.56,275.56
     than 250 milliliters of fluid within a 24-hour period.
},
{
    279.92,284.72
     If your incisions or drains require dressings you will be given the
},
{
    284.72,287.0
     supplies you need to take care of them.
},
{
    287.0,295.0
     You may not require dressings. If you run out of supplies, you can buy more, such as gauze pads, at any drugstore.
},
{
    295.0,302.0
     We recommend a caregiver who can be a family member or a friend care for the incision and drain sites.
},
{
    307.0,313.0
     incision and drain sites. Do not take a bath or submerge your incisions or any part of the drain system in water.
},
{
    313.0,317.0
     Avoid swimming pools, jacuzzi, lakes and oceans.
},
{
    317.0,323.0
     You may take baths and swim only after your surgeon tells you it's safe to do so.
},
{
    323.0,326.96
     You may shower with the drain in place 48 hours after surgery.
},
{
    328.64,333.84
     If you are unable to shower, clean the drain insertion site with soap and water at least
},
{
    333.84,341.92
     one time each day. You and your caregiver should always wash your hands first. Begin by inspecting
},
{
    341.92,347.5
     the incision and drain insertion sites. Do this at least one time each day.
},
{
    347.5,353.5
     Make a note of any changes in color or swelling at the incision or drain insertion sites.
},
{
    359.5,363.5
     There are many ways to dress and care for the drain insertion site.
},
{
    363.5,366.72
     There are also different types of dressings.
},
{
    366.72,371.32
     Depending on what your surgeon has chosen for your specific needs, care of the area
},
{
    371.32,372.8
     will vary.
},
{
    372.8,383.72
     Please follow the instructions specific to your type of dressing.
},
{
    383.72,389.64
     Four by four inch gauze and tape dressings were applied to your skin over the drain insertion site
},
{
    389.64,392.76
     at the time of your surgery.
},
{
    392.76,396.68
     You need to change your gauze dressing one time each day.
},
{
    396.68,400.2
     You may shower 48 hours after surgery.
},
{
    400.2,405.04
     We recommend changing your gauze dressing when you shower.
},
{
    410.08,413.84
     Before you shower, gently remove the old tape and gauze dressing and throw them away.
},
{
    417.68,421.36
     Gently clean the wound drain insertion site with soap and water. Allow soapy water to run over the dressing like a waterfall.
},
{
    422.08,429.0
     Rinse well. Pat the area dry with a clean towel. Allow to air dry for a few minutes.
},
{
    429.0,437.0
     If you are unable to shower, clean the area with soap and water and rinse well at least one time each day.
},
{
    437.0,445.92
     To redress the drain insertion site, begin by opening and laying out your supplies on a clean dry surface.
},
{
    446.48,452.96
     Two or three strips of tape. Two 4x4 inch gauze squares for each drain you have.
},
{
    453.92,470.84
     Start by folding one gauze square in half. With a folded edge up, place one gauze pad under the drain where the drain meets your skin. Use one piece of tape to secure it to your skin.
},
{
    470.84,474.32
     Fold the second piece of 4x4 gauze in half.
},
{
    474.32,479.8
     Again, with the folded edge up, place it over the top of the drain.
},
{
    479.8,483.36
     Use another piece of tape to secure it in place.
},
{
    483.36,487.28
     Your drain insertion site should remain covered at all times.
},
{
    487.28,490.2
     The gauze and tape dressing should be replaced daily
},
{
    490.2,492.68
     every time you clean the drain insertion site
},
{
    492.68,495.64
     or if the dressing falls off or becomes soiled.
},
{
    502.28,504.44
     Each day, while cleaning your incisions
},
{
    504.44,508.4
     and drain insertion site, look for signs of infection.
},
{
    508.4,515.96
     Typical signs of infection include redness or swelling, drainage with pus, opening of
},
{
    515.96,525.28
     the incision, bad odor, pain and or fever with a temperature above 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit.
},
{
    525.28,538.32
     If you have any of these signs of infection, call the Breast Center immediately.
},
{
    538.32,542.92
     Because you have a drain, you need to empty and measure the contents of the bulb.
},
{
    542.92,545.48
     This is called stripping the drain.
},
{
    545.48,548.68
     You must strip the drain at least two times a day
},
{
    548.68,550.6
     to prevent the drain from becoming clogged
},
{
    550.6,552.96
     with blood clots or fibrous material.
},
{
    554.32,557.62
     To strip the drain, first wash your hands.
},
{
    558.78,560.72
     With your non-dominant hand,
},
{
    560.72,564.3
     firmly hold the drain without moving it near the skin
},
{
    564.3,566.36
     at the drain insertion site. With your dominant hand and close to the drain without moving it near the skin at the drain insertion site.
},
{
    566.36,571.82
     With your dominant hand and close to the drain stitch, place an alcohol prep pad around
},
{
    571.82,577.52
     the drain. With your thumb and first finger, gently pinch the drain with the alcohol prep
},
{
    577.52,583.64
     pad and slide the alcohol prep pad down the entire length of the drain until your fingers
},
{
    583.64,585.76
     meet the top of the bulb.
},
{
    585.76,590.76
     The alcohol prep pad helps your fingers slide more easily along the tube.
},
{
    590.76,595.88
     The fluid should move along with your fingers down the length of the drain and empty into
},
{
    595.88,597.04
     the bulb.
},
{
    597.04,601.14
     Repeat this procedure for each drain you have.
},
{
    601.14,606.3
     It is not necessary to completely clear all the fluid from the drain, but try to move
},
{
    606.3,611.38
     as many clots down the drain into the bulb as you can.
},
{
    611.38,616.32
     If the flow of the drainage is blocked and stripping does not restore the flow, call
},
{
    616.32,624.36
     the breast center.
},
{
    624.36,629.4
     At least two times a day after you have stripped the drain, empty the fluid collected in each
},
{
    629.4,632.66
     bulb into a separate measuring cup.
},
{
    632.66,637.6
     To empty the bulb and measure the fluid, follow these steps.
},
{
    637.6,642.56
     After stripping the drain, unplug the stopper from the emptying port located at the top
},
{
    642.56,643.96
     of the bulb.
},
{
    643.96,647.54
     Tip the bulb upside down over the measuring cup.
},
{
    647.54,651.82
     Gently squeeze all of the fluid from the bulb into the measuring cup.
},
{
    651.82,654.94
     Your nurse will give you measuring cups.
},
{
    654.94,659.46
     If your bulb is small and fills quickly, you may need to empty the bulb and measure the
},
{
    659.46,662.2
     fluid more than two times a day.
},
{
    662.2,668.56
     Do not let the bulb completely fill because this will stop the fluid from flowing into the bulb.
},
{
    668.56,673.44
     Do not disconnect the drain tubing from the bulb at any time.
},
{
    673.44,677.44
     If the drainage into the bulb stops, call the breast center.
},
{
    683.84,690.1
     Two times a day, measure and record the amount of fluid collected in each bulb.
},
{
    690.1,695.1
     It is very important that you record the amount of fluid for each bulb separately at least
},
{
    695.1,696.92
     two times every day.
},
{
    696.92,700.02
     Do not record a daily or weekly total.
},
{
    700.02,702.98
     Do not record the total of all bulbs.
},
{
    702.98,708.54
     On the Volume of Drainage chart, record the date, time, and amount of fluid collected
},
{
    708.54,710.22
     from each bulb.
},
{
    710.22,713.5
     Your nurse reviews your Volume of Drainage chart.
},
{
    713.5,719.42
     This information is used to determine if your drains can safely be removed.
},
{
    719.42,723.34
     After you have recorded the amount of fluid from each bulb on your Volume of Drainage
},
{
    723.34,727.0
     chart, discard the fluid by flushing it down the toilet.
},
{
    727.0,735.0
     In the evening, when you empty and measure your fluid drainage, take your body temperature and record it on the volume of drainage chart.
},
{
    735.0,745.0
     If your body temperature is ever 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher, call the breast center.
},
{
    749.3,753.88
     After emptying and measuring the fluid from each bulb, you will need to
},
{
    753.88,759.84
     reactivate the bulb suction. First, wipe the port opening with an alcohol swab to
},
{
    759.84,767.52
     clean it. Next, gently squeeze the bulb and flatten it as completely as possible. While the bulb is
},
{
    767.52,774.16
     completely flattened, insert the stopper into the emptying port as far as possible. Release your grip
},
{
    774.16,780.56
     from the bulb. If the bulb stays flattened, you have successfully reactivated the bulb suction.
},
{
    781.68,786.24
     In the next few hours, you will notice the bulb expanding gradually as it
},
{
    786.24,792.58
     fills with fluid. If the bulb does not expand gradually and collect fluid, call
},
{
    792.58,795.48
     the breast center.
},
{
    799.08,805.8
     Gravity is necessary to keep the drains functioning properly. You must place the bulb below the
},
{
    805.8,811.88
     drain insertion site. Using the plastic tag on the bulb, attach it to your clothing or drain
},
{
    811.88,834.4
     belt. Do not disconnect, bend, compress, or puncture the drain center. The length of time that your drain remains in place depends on the amount of fluid coming
},
{
    834.4,836.24
     from the surgical site.
},
{
    836.24,842.2
     When one drain produces less than 30 milliliters of drainage over a 24-hour period for two
},
{
    842.2,846.24
     days in a row, your drain is ready to be removed.
},
{
    846.24,849.04
     When your drain output meets this criteria,
},
{
    849.04,850.4
     call the breast center,
},
{
    850.4,852.6
     and the nurses will schedule your appointment
},
{
    852.6,854.64
     for your drain to be removed.
},
{
    854.64,857.32
     The drains are usually removed within three weeks
},
{
    857.32,860.52
     of the surgery, regardless of the drainage output.
},
{
    860.52,863.32
     However, your surgeon may recommend removal
},
{
    863.32,864.96
     at a different time.
},
{
    864.96,865.2
     After your drain is removed, continue to wash that area of your skin daily However, your surgeon may recommend removal at a different time.
},
{
    865.2,870.08
     After your drain is removed, continue to wash that area of your skin daily with soap and
},
{
    870.08,871.4
     water.
},
{
    871.4,876.88
     After the drain is removed in clinic, your nurse may tape a 4x4 gauze bandage over the
},
{
    876.88,878.28
     drain site.
},
{
    878.28,885.6
     You may remove the tape and gauze 24 hours after the drain is removed. It is not necessary to replace the gauze.
},
{
    892.32,896.64
     You are responsible for the care of your incision and drain insertion site when you
},
{
    896.64,902.8
     leave the hospital after surgery. It is important that you recognize any unusual changes with your
},
{
    902.8,905.84
     incision, the drain, and the drain insertion site.
},
{
    907.68,910.88
     Call the Breast Center if any of the following things occur.
},
{
    911.52,917.6
     The bulb suction cannot be activated. The drain falls out or is accidentally cut.
},
{
    917.6,926.8
     The drain fluid in the bulb has a foul smell. You have a body temperature of 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. There is
},
{
    926.8,931.6
     increased redness, swelling, or abnormal drainage from the drain insertion site.
},
{
    931.6,938.48
     There is an air leak, fluid leak, or any other malfunction in the system.
},
{
    938.48,943.92
     Clots form in the tubing and block drainage. The bulb is not collecting
},
{
    943.92,945.96
