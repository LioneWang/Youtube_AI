{
    0.0,2.92
     I'm Dr. Adam Fields.
},
{
    2.92,6.22
     Let's get your legs strong and support those knees.
},
{
    6.22,8.84
     Get a chair, something you can support yourself with.
},
{
    8.84,11.56
     We're going to start with your left and my right leg.
},
{
    11.56,16.08
     Go ahead and point your leg and just lift that leg and hold it for a second and bring
},
{
    16.08,17.08
     it down.
},
{
    17.08,18.88
     Your leg has to be totally locked out at this point.
},
{
    18.88,23.92
     We're working something called the VMO or the Vastus Medialis Oblicus.
},
{
    23.92,27.24
     Muscle just lift, hold for a second and bring it down.
},
{
    27.24,31.0
     The chest is up, the posture is up, you're doing great.
},
{
    31.0,33.72
     Lift that leg, you're going to feel this muscle right here.
},
{
    33.72,36.0
     Straighten that leg even harder, as hard as you can.
},
{
    36.0,38.08
     Now let's come up and do some pulses.
},
{
    38.08,41.08
     Let's do 20 pulses.
},
{
    41.08,49.44
     Feel it burn, chest is up. Straighten that leg even harder. Go for it people. You
},
{
    49.44,54.52
     got this one. Excellent. Now let's go ahead and do some glutes. We're gonna
},
{
    54.52,59.2
     we're gonna bring that leg up. Just keep it straight and just lift and down. Lift
},
{
    59.2,63.76
     and down. Just like that. Feel that glute engage. You're gonna have great glutes.
},
{
    63.76,68.12
     We need great glutes. Strong glutes are going to help your knees, support your
},
{
    68.12,72.96
     knees, help you when you're walking upstairs. Let's just push, feel it
},
{
    72.96,78.6
     contract when you bring it up and down. Feel it contract. Good. Let's get a little
},
{
    78.6,85.6
     burn going. Make sure that standing leg is strong. Beautiful, the chest is coming up,
},
{
    85.6,86.6
     the shoulders are coming down,
},
{
    86.6,88.44
     the abs are even engaged a little bit.
},
{
    88.44,90.8
     Engage those abs, it'll give your glutes
},
{
    90.8,92.6
     something to resist against.
},
{
    94.64,97.56
     Good, now we're gonna bend the leg and bring it up.
},
{
    97.56,99.52
     Bend the leg, bring it up.
},
{
    99.52,101.24
     Feel the glutes.
},
{
    101.24,104.08
     If you like, you don't have to hold on to anything.
},
{
    104.08,108.94
     You can work on that balance, but let's get the exercises down first.
},
{
    108.94,110.94
     Feel the glutes.
},
{
    110.94,116.16
     You're going to feel that standing leg just start to talk to you like crazy also.
},
{
    116.16,132.76
     And then let's do some pulses. Almost like you're trying to take your leg and bring it over your head.
},
{
    132.76,137.92
     Ten more.
},
{
    137.92,141.76
     Great.
},
{
    141.76,143.96
     Let's do your right side.
},
{
    143.96,145.88
     Chest is up.
},
{
    145.88,150.4
     Let's bring that right leg up and hold for a second.
},
{
    150.4,154.0
     And down, up, hold for a second.
},
{
    154.0,156.8
     Up, there it is.
},
{
    156.8,159.16
     Up.
},
{
    159.16,160.96
     Feel that VMO contract.
},
{
    160.96,163.2
     Straighten your leg as hard as you can like bamboo.
},
{
    163.2,165.32
     Make it totally straight.
},
{
    165.32,169.88
     These are little movements that produce a lot of results. You're going to be doing a lot
},
{
    169.88,174.84
     of these so get used to it. Chest is up. Let's see it like Superman. Show that S on your
},
{
    174.84,193.68
     chest. There you go.
},
{
    193.68,194.68
     And then turn.
},
{
    194.68,196.52
     And let's get the glutes.
},
{
    196.52,198.24
     Straight leg first.
},
{
    198.24,199.64
     Lift and down.
},
{
    199.64,203.6
     Just barely tap on the floor with your toe and lift.
},
{
    203.6,204.6
     Barely tap.
},
{
    204.6,205.32
     Lift. There it is. Barely tap on the floor with your toe and lift. Barely tap, lift.
},
{
    205.32,206.2
     There it is.
},
{
    206.2,209.14
     Feel that contraction, maximum contraction.
},
{
    213.8,217.0
     Gluteus maximus, nice big muscle.
},
{
    217.0,220.2
     Help all those little accessory muscles function right.
},
{
    220.2,223.28
     Give them some support on their journey.
},
{
    226.0,229.76
     Okay, bend the leg and bring it up. Push. Bend the leg.
},
{
    231.04,232.16
     Good. There it is.
},
{
    244.72,247.32
     Feel a little shake, that's good.
},
{
    247.32,250.0
     And then just pulse it.
},
{
    250.0,256.32
     Get the most out of your glutes right here.
},
{
    256.32,258.52
     There you go.
},
{
    258.52,264.4
     10, 9, 8, come on.
},
{
    264.4,272.54
     5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Perfect. Shake it out a little bit. Good. Getting the
},
{
    272.54,276.6
     waking these legs up. Your knees are going to just be lubricated after this.
},
{
    276.6,280.94
     Okay, let's go ahead. We're going to do another similar exercise. You're going to
},
{
    280.94,287.82
     lift. You're going to do a circle with your leg. Circle and stop at the top, bring it out and towards the center.
},
{
    287.82,289.38
     Bring it out, towards the center.
},
{
    289.38,290.38
     There you go.
},
{
    290.38,295.46
     Chest is up, out and towards the center.
},
{
    295.46,299.02
     You'll feel that muscle just grab on that outer part of the circle.
},
{
    299.02,303.38
     You feel that VMO just take control at kneecap, right?
},
{
    303.38,305.56
     Tracking it where it needs to track right in the groove
},
{
    305.56,308.32
     that your femur forms.
},
{
    308.32,309.16
     Perfect.
},
{
    310.12,313.16
     Let's make those knees so they don't crack and pop anymore.
},
{
    314.12,317.08
     Let's get them lubricated, let's do gliding.
},
{
    317.08,317.92
     Perfect.
},
{
    318.8,321.8
     You're gonna feel loose on the inner thigh also.
},
{
    321.8,322.64
     Good.
},
{
    322.64,324.96
     Okay, let's do a little outer hip
},
{
    324.96,326.76
     and lift to the outside and
},
{
    326.76,334.64
     bring it down slowly. Lift and bring it down slowly. Lift it and down slowly. Good.
},
{
    334.64,339.52
     Chest is up. Abs are engaged. Keep them engaged. Let your body know that, hey, these
},
{
    339.52,346.2
     abs can be engaged all the time. They can be protecting my back all the time.
},
{
    346.2,349.84
     Pull those shoulders down, remind them down your back,
},
{
    349.84,351.4
     like water dripping down your back.
},
{
    351.4,354.36
     Just take those scapula and bring them down.
},
{
    354.36,356.28
     You're going to feel the standing leg big time here
},
{
    356.28,358.04
     on that outer glute also.
},
{
    358.04,360.4
     Up, squeeze, and down.
},
{
    360.4,364.12
     Up, squeeze, up, squeeze.
},
{
    364.12,365.9
     Good, let's do the glutes one more time and
},
{
    366.68,373.12
     Just lift lift this time instead of all the way down. We're just gonna keep it at the top and we're just gonna pulse pulse
},
{
    373.12,375.12
     It's like an inch of movement
},
{
    378.04,380.32
     Maximum contraction minimal movement
},
{
    389.04,390.32
     movement. Big breaths.
},
{
    390.32,391.32
     Just feel it.
},
{
    391.32,394.16
     Don't hold your breath on any exercise.
},
{
    394.16,395.16
     Doing good.
},
{
    395.16,399.72
     Let's go 10 more.
},
{
    399.72,403.92
     Perfect.
},
{
    403.92,408.92
     Now this set of circles, this time you're going to go up and out instead of around and down.
},
{
    408.92,412.96
     So we bring it up and around.
},
{
    412.96,414.96
     Up and around.
},
{
    414.96,416.8
     Up and around.
},
{
    416.8,417.8
     Good job.
},
{
    417.8,420.08
     Up, around.
},
{
    420.08,421.64
     Get that strong standing leg.
},
{
    421.64,423.32
     Balance if you can.
},
{
    423.32,425.8
     Take yourself to the next level. Here we go.
},
{
    428.28,429.44
     Gauge the abs.
},
{
    430.48,432.9
     If you're a little wobbly, that's okay.
},
{
    438.24,439.4
     Here we go.
},
{
    439.4,441.36
     Bring it up and around.
},
{
    446.52,448.36
     Two more.
},
{
    448.36,452.68
     One and two. Good. Let's go to the other leg.
},
{
    453.28,457.56
     Shake it out a little bit because that standing leg is about to work. It's gonna be a little harder on this one.
},
{
    459.0,464.32
     So we're gonna go around and stop and down. Good. Around and down.
},
{
    465.32,468.04
     Around and down. Good, around and down. Around and down.
},
{
    468.04,469.28
     See I'm wobbling a little bit?
},
{
    469.28,471.16
     That's my muscles learning.
},
{
    471.16,472.56
     That's proprioception people.
},
{
    472.56,474.16
     That's what you're looking for.
},
{
    474.16,476.56
     That skill acquisition, that goes right to the brain,
},
{
    476.56,478.6
     helps neurological highways.
},
{
    478.6,480.84
     We want that brain to function good
},
{
    480.84,483.32
     and mechanics help brain function.
},
{
    484.2,485.76
     Keep yourself flexible, keep your
},
{
    485.76,492.72
     mechanics working good. The athlete is the smart athlete. There it is. Good, let's do
},
{
    492.72,501.78
     five more. One, chest is up, remind that chest up. Three, four, one more, five.
},
{
    501.78,507.96
     We're gonna kick to the side now. Kick to the side and bring it down.
},
{
    507.96,509.2
     Kick to the side, you're feeling this one
},
{
    509.2,511.52
     a little bit more than the other one, didn't you?
},
{
    511.52,513.28
     That standing leg worked for you
},
{
    513.28,516.64
     and now it's gotta work as an on standing leg.
},
{
    516.64,519.84
     Lift and squeeze and down.
},
{
    519.84,523.04
     Lift and squeeze and down.
},
{
    523.04,526.68
     Lift, squeeze, down.
},
{
    526.68,529.28
     Let's get legs like a ballet dancer.
},
{
    529.28,532.2
     Let's get muscular legs that do whatever we need them
},
{
    532.2,533.58
     to do for us.
},
{
    533.58,534.42
     And down.

},
{
    539.12,539.96
     And down.
},
{
    539.96,540.78
     Let's go ahead and get the glutes.
},
{
    540.78,542.48
     Remember, we're gonna pulse it this time.
},
{
    542.48,543.32
     Pulse it.
},
{
    543.32,551.2
     Lift and pulse, pulse, pulse, pulse, feel the glute right here. Just meditate on that
},
{
    551.2,556.44
     glute. Visualize it in your head. See it working for you. Picture some good glutes.
},
{
    556.44,563.2
     See a ballet dancer, Baryshnikov. See those glutes. See them as your glutes.
},
{
    563.2,568.0
     See a fibrous working muscle that's just contracting for you.
},
{
    568.0,572.0
     Good. Let's go. 15 more. Let's go.
},
{
    576.0,580.0
     Hang in there. Good. Come on now.
},
{
    591.16,592.68
     Oh yeah, very good. Shake it out a little bit.
},
{
    592.68,593.68
     Good.
},

    593.68,594.88
     Loving it, people.
},
{
    594.88,595.88
     Feel these muscles.
},
{
    595.88,597.36
     Feel what this is doing for you.
},
{
    597.36,598.36
     Right?
},
{
    598.36,600.56
     Your legs are happy, your knees are happy.
},
{
    600.56,602.64
     We're going to do a plie squat.
},
{
    602.64,608.88
     So stand with your feet like a duck and just bring one foot in front of the other.
},
{
    608.88,614.04
     Realize you want to go really shallow initially, especially if you have any knee issues.
},
{
    614.04,615.04
     Hands on your hips.
},
{
    615.04,619.0
     We're just going to come up and come down and squeeze.
},
{
    619.0,620.96
     Coming up, use the inner thighs.
},
{
    620.96,625.88
     Feel the inner thighs working for you right here and squeeze at the top.
},
{
    625.88,626.88
     Good.
},
{
    626.88,630.0
     Squeeze.
},
{
    630.0,631.0
     Extend the low back.
},
{
    631.0,632.0
     Chest is up.
},
{
    632.0,650.0
     Push down through your heels and tighten them as hard as you can when they come up. Ooh, it's a good one.
},
{
    650.0,656.4
     Okay, let's go other side.
},
{
    656.4,658.4
     Good.
},
{
    658.4,663.56
     You might feel it feels a little bit different on this side.
},
{
    663.56,667.72
     Just try and focus on weight a little bit towards, cheated a little bit towards the
},
{
    667.72,675.6
     heels, the toes out and straighten those legs as hard as you can at the top.
},
{
    675.6,676.6
     There we go.
},
{
    676.6,677.8
     There we go.
},
{
    677.8,680.32
     Feel the squeeze, feel the burn.
},
{
    680.32,682.52
     Give yourself what you deserve.
},
{
    682.52,689.84
     Good legs.
},
{
    695.2,696.16
     We take these legs to the beach, take them surfing, take them running upstairs,
},
{
    700.0,700.64
     take them to the next level, climb that mountain, ski down the mountain,
},
{
    702.08,706.0
     whatever you need. Let's do three more.
},
{
    711.0,715.0
     Okay, next we're going to do calf raises. Okay, this time with the toes out. Toes out like a duck. Straighten those legs.
},
{
    715.0,718.0
     And you might need to use the balance on this one.
},
{
    718.0,723.0
     Come up, squeeze at the top, hold, and come slowly down.
},
{
    723.0,726.88
     Come up, squeeze at the top. There, and come slowly down. Come up, squeeze at the top.

{
    750.52,754.24
     Straighten your legs all the way, you'll feel it a little bit more in the calves.
},
{
    754.24,756.44
     Keep the chest up, lead with your chest.
},
{
    756.44,759.92
     Like someone's just pulling you up from the chest.
},
{
    759.92,763.48
     Good, pulling you up from the chest.
},
{
    763.48,766.36
     Good, pulling you up up from the chest. Good. Pulling you up.
},
{
    766.36,769.0
     There we go.
},
{
    769.0,770.0
     Good.
},
{
    770.0,772.2
     Let's get our cat's sore.
},
{
    772.2,773.2
     Right?
},
{
    773.2,774.88
     There it is.
},
{
    774.88,776.4
     Give them what they want.
},
{
    776.4,777.4
     Okay.
},
{
    777.4,779.2
     We're going to work the front.
},
{
    779.2,781.4
     We're going to work the tibialis anterior now.
},
{
    781.4,783.0
     You're going to do a heel walk.
},
{
    783.0,788.64
     I want you to lift your toes off the ground. We're going to walk. We're going to walk in a circle. Okay, just a
},
{
    788.64,795.36
     circle like this. On the heels. Keep going.
},
{
    798.88,803.04
     Feel the front of those heels. You can do this with shoes on. If you're on a
},
{
    803.04,807.68
     hardwood floor and you don't have shoes on,'s gonna be a little tough. Let's go ahead
},
{
    807.68,813.04
     the other direction. Let's do some circles. Whoo!
},
{
    815.36,830.52
     Little circle, one more. Oh yeah. Now let's do a little heel to toe. So we're going to go heel to toe, heel to toe.
},
{
    830.52,836.52
     Oops, I went toe to heel, toe to heel.
},
{
    836.52,840.2
     There it is, toe to heel.
},
{
    840.2,842.28
     Let's keep going.
},
{
    842.28,845.52
     Heel, this one has a little balance.
},
{
    845.52,848.08
     Let's pause at the top, pause at the top,
},
{
    848.08,851.36
     and pause at the top of each extreme range of motion.
},
{
    851.36,854.44
     Pause for a second, and pause for a second.
},
{
    854.44,855.28
     There we go.
},
{
    855.28,858.12
     Pause with the heels, pause with the toes.
},
{
    858.12,860.84
     Pause with the heels, pause with the toes.
},
{
    860.84,861.68
     Keep going.
},
{
    861.68,866.88
     Now we're going to do some just plain calves in the front.
},
{
    866.88,868.28
     Chest is up.
},
{
    868.28,871.32
     Coming up, hold and down.
},
{
    871.32,874.84
     Coming up, hold and down.
},
{
    874.84,878.36
     Up on the toes, squeeze and down.
},
{
    878.36,880.84
     Up, squeeze.
},
{
    880.84,888.44
     Picture those calves just with cuts and rips. Like a diamond that's just cut with
},
{
    888.44,896.4
     facets and angles. There it is. They can spring like a gazelle. They can do run at
},
{
    896.4,905.0
     a moment's notice. We're just playing ping-pong. Good. Up, squeeze. Good. Up, squeeze. Good.
},
{
    905.0,909.72
     So now we're going to just, we're going to go on the heels, we're just going to lift,
},
{
    909.72,911.4
     we're going to pulse.
},
{
    911.4,915.4
     So you're going to hold on to whatever you have there, and we're just going to lift the
},
{
    915.4,916.4
     heels.
},
{
    916.4,920.76
     Lift, lift, lift, lift.
},
{
    920.76,922.6
     It's a challenging one.
},
{
    922.6,923.6
     Lift, squeeze.
},
{
    923.6,927.0
     So you're not actually touching the feet down.
},
{
    927.0,934.8
     You're just going almost or just barely tapping and bringing them up. There we go. That's
},
{
    934.8,950.0
     it. You got it. You got it. Good. Now we're going to go inward. Just like this. We're going to lift. And so you're now you're doing calves with
},
{
    950.0,965.28
     the feet inward, like a pigeon toe. Up, pigeon. Good. Up, pigeon. Good. Pigeon. There it is.
},
{
    965.28,966.28
     You got it.
},
{
    966.28,967.28
     Oh, push it.
},
{
    967.28,968.28
     Let's do six more.
},
{
    968.28,969.28
     There we go.
},
{
    969.28,970.28
     That's good.
},
{
    970.28,971.28
     Man, I can feel them now.
},
{
    971.28,976.28
     Okay, we're going to work the glutes a little bit and a little bit on the low back.
},
{
    976.28,987.48
     I'm going to go the glutes a little bit and a little bit on the low back.
},
{
    987.48,989.8
     I'm going to go to the side here.
},
{
    989.8,991.76
     The chest is up.
},
{
    991.76,993.68
     Feet are right around hip distance.
},
{
    993.68,995.24
     Arch the low back.
},
{
    995.24,996.24
     Hands back.
},
{
    996.24,997.24
     Palms down.
},
{
    997.24,998.24
     Coming forward like this.
},
{
    998.24,1000.4
     This is a founder exercise.
},
{
    1000.4,1001.4
     Chest is up.
},
{
    1001.4,1002.64
     Pull the shoulders down towards the butt.
},
{
    1002.64,1006.22
     And let's try and get that body horizontal.
},
{
    1006.22,1007.54
     Good, the hands are up.
},
{
    1009.06,1012.36
     And you're feeling this in your glutes, your low back.
},
{
    1012.36,1013.56
     Really just push it here.
},
{
    1013.56,1016.56
     Push that hips back, push the hands forward.
},
{
    1016.56,1017.78
     Give it some distance.
},
{
    1020.28,1023.12
     And now we're gonna do with the hands behind the head,
},
{
    1023.12,1024.16
     we'll do some good mornings.
},
{
    1024.16,1027.56
     We're coming down and coming up. but keep the arch in that low back
},
{
    1028.2,1030.76
     Good little low back little glutes
},
{
    1037.56,1041.64
     You think of horses right they run so fast they've got those big glutes
},
{
    1041.64,1045.0
     They don't have much for knees right they don't even have much for a VMO.
},
{
    1045.0,1047.0
     They're using them glutes.
},
{
    1047.3,1049.0
     Let's keep going.
},
{
    1049.0,1050.8
     Chest is up.
},
{
    1050.8,1052.5
     You got it.
},
{
    1052.5,1054.9
     Just feel a little stretch in the hamstrings when you're on your way down.
},
{
    1056.6,1058.24
     Beautiful.
},
{
    1058.24,1064.64
     Do you feel your glutes working? Then you're doing it right. Pull the shoulders down towards the butt. Arch that low back.
},
{
    1066.06,1067.06
     Chest is up.
},
{
    1067.06,1069.0
     Oh, we're having fun.
},
{
    1069.0,1070.52
     I'm so glad you're here.
},
{
    1070.52,1072.04
     I'm glad to be here.
},
{
    1072.04,1073.04
     Let's keep going.
},
{
    1073.04,1075.0
     Let's do five more.
},
{
    1075.0,1082.0
     One, three, four, five.
},
{
    1082.0,1083.0
     Beautiful.
},
{
    1083.0,1085.64
     We're going to do a lunge stretch.
},
{
    1087.96,1088.92
     Put your left leg forward, your right leg back.
},
{
    1092.24,1094.96
     Chest is up, hands are up, and we're gonna lean over to the side, okay?
},
{
    1094.96,1097.8
     Interlace your thumbs, straighten your arms,
},
{
    1097.8,1098.72
     and lean over.
},
{
    1098.72,1102.84
     I want you to feel this hip flexor right here.
},
{
    1102.84,1105.76
     Let's go, sink into it for a couple of deep breaths.
},
{
    1113.24,1114.32
     Beautiful, feel that.
},
{
    1114.32,1116.48
     Okay, let's go to the other side.
},
{
    1116.48,1117.68
     If we stretch the hip flexor,
},
{
    1117.68,1120.08
     the glutes tend to engage a little bit better.
},
{
    1121.28,1125.24
     We'll go to the other side. Chest is up. Arch.
},
{
    1125.24,1127.24
     Let that body just come over.
},
{
    1127.24,1128.24
     Feel the ribs open up.
},
{
    1128.24,1132.0
     Straighten the arms and bring it on over.
},
{
    1132.0,1133.0
     Beautiful.
},
{
    1133.0,1138.0
     Doesn't it feel great to exercise?
},
{
    1138.0,1143.2
     Doesn't it feel the great to do what your body needs it to do?
},
{
    1143.2,1144.2
     Okay.
},
{
    1144.2,1146.0
     Now we're going to pull in some squats.
},
{
    1146.0,1147.64
     Now, if you have pain in your knees,
},
{
    1147.64,1150.8
     something doesn't feel right, go very shallow.
},
{
    1150.8,1152.88
     Okay, we're gonna do front squats.
},
{
    1152.88,1155.16
     The toes are pointed straight ahead.
},
{
    1155.16,1157.28
     We're gonna lift the arms up to counterbalance
},
{
    1158.28,1159.64
     when we come down.
},
{
    1159.64,1161.0
     You're gonna sit down,
},
{
    1161.0,1163.72
     so the knees aren't gonna come up in front of the toes.
},
{
    1163.72,1166.2
     They're gonna stay closer to where the ankles are.
},
{
    1166.2,1170.68
     Okay, so we're going to just come down and come up and straighten the legs as hard as
},
{
    1170.68,1174.76
     you can at the top and push down through those heels.
},
{
    1174.76,1176.88
     Good.
},
{
    1176.88,1180.6
     Nice and slow.
},
{
    1180.6,1184.44
     There you go.
},
{
    1184.44,1189.44
     You know, you may want to make sure that you're not standing on the outer part of your foot.
},
{
    1189.44,1196.76
     You're really contacting all four corners of your foot with this and it creates more stability.
},
{
    1196.76,1201.0
     And those knees are tracking in between your first and second toe.
},
{
    1201.0,1204.48
     There we go.
},
{
    1204.48,1209.46
     Keep coming.
},
{
    1209.46,1214.46
     Good.
},
{
    1214.46,1227.0
     Let's do three more.
},
{
    1227.0,1232.0
     One, two, three.
},
{
    1232.0,1233.0
     Good.
},
{
    1233.0,1234.36
     Let's go ahead and do a crossover stretch.
},
{
    1234.36,1237.6
     Take your right leg, put it in front of your left leg.
},
{
    1237.6,1242.04
     Take your right hand, put it on top of your hip, your left hand on top of your head, and
},
{
    1242.04,1246.9
     just come over to your right, chest is up and just lean
},
{
    1246.9,1247.9
     into that hip.
},
{
    1247.9,1250.28
     Want to stretch that outer hip a little bit.
},
{
    1250.28,1253.82
     Want that inner to kind of take over a little bit when we're doing these squats.
},
{
    1253.82,1257.18
     Chest up, arch your body up like it's a rainbow.
},
{
    1257.18,1259.42
     Push your ribs up towards the ceiling.
},
{
    1259.42,1265.68
     Pull the shoulders, your right shoulder down, chest is up, big breath in.
},
{
    1267.98,1269.68
     Get that elbow, push it towards the ceiling, open that whole side body, good.
},
{
    1269.68,1271.32
     Let's go ahead and do the other side.
},
{
    1271.32,1274.32
     Take your left foot, put it in front of your right,
},
{
    1274.32,1276.56
     take your left hand, put it on your hip,
},
{
    1276.56,1278.2
     your right hand on top of your head,
},
{
    1278.2,1280.48
     and lean your body to the left.
},
{
    1280.48,1282.4
     Ooh, this feels good.
},
{
    1282.4,1284.72
     Oh yeah, just ring your body out.
},
{
    1284.72,1287.48
     Ringing out toxins, bringing in nutrients.
},
{
    1287.48,1288.94
     Get your cells like they're pumps.
},
{
    1288.94,1293.06
     You're just pumping out junk, bringing in nutrition.
},
{
    1293.06,1294.76
     Every cell in your body is happy with this.
},
{
    1294.76,1296.56
     Breathe right in through those ribs.
},
{
    1303.56,1305.88
     Okay, we're gonna do more standard squat.
},
{
    1305.88,1309.52
     Your feet are going to be a little wider than they were for the front squats.
},
{
    1309.52,1313.76
     Slightly flared out, the knees are still tracking in between the first and second toe.
},
{
    1313.76,1316.3
     You can put your hands up here like a goal post.
},
{
    1316.3,1321.68
     Chest is up, lean back onto your heels, coming down and coming up.
},
{
    1321.68,1330.2
     If you have any popping or clicking, activate those inner thighs a little bit. Activate the glutes a little bit. Go slow enough that the muscles
},
{
    1330.2,1334.28
     don't stop engaging, even when you're all the way down at the bottom. Good. And at
},
{
    1334.28,1340.88
     the very top, you squeeze those legs. You go into hyper contraction. Chest comes up
},
{
    1340.88,1345.48
     the whole time. Stick the butt way out. That's why we did that founder exercise.
},
{
    1345.48,1348.4
     Push, get the glutes engaging.
},
{
    1348.4,1350.24
     I love whole body exercises.
},
{
    1350.24,1350.88
     Good.
},
{
    1350.88,1351.92
     Chest is up.
},
{
    1351.92,1353.92
     Pinch the shoulder blades.
},
{
    1353.92,1357.2
     Keep the shoulder blades down towards your butt.
},
{
    1357.2,1357.76
     There we go.
},
{
    1362.4,1364.44
     If you're at that level, you're welcome
},
{
    1364.44,1367.0
     to put weight on your body for this one.
},
{
    1367.0,1373.08
     Let's do four more.
},
{
    1373.08,1376.08
     Realizing we're not going too fast.
},
{
    1376.08,1377.08
     Beautiful.
},
{
    1377.08,1380.88
     Okay, we're going to do a little inner thigh stretch.
},
{
    1380.88,1383.48
     Bring the feet a little wider.
},
{
    1383.48,1386.36
     Put the hands on the knees. Good.
},
{
    1386.36,1391.36
     Push them out and come down. Now I like to do this one with the hands in prayer
},
{
    1391.36,1396.48
     and push the elbows out a little bit. So we're really stretching out those inner
},
{
    1396.48,1402.4
     thighs all the way to the groin. Chest is up. Nice beautiful posture like this. I
},
{
    1402.4,1405.32
     feel like a native in this position or something.
},
{
    1405.32,1406.32
     Loving it.
},
{
    1406.32,1408.02
     Push those elbows out.
},
{
    1408.02,1409.52
     Push the knees out.
},
{
    1409.52,1414.56
     Even big breath in through it.
},
{
    1414.56,1418.2
     Push, push, push, push, push, push, push.
},
{
    1418.2,1424.48
     Sink the hips down a little bit deeper and feel the hips open up.
},
{
    1424.48,1426.92
     Loving it. Okay, now we're gonna do sumo squats.
},
{
    1426.92,1430.08
     The legs are gonna be a little bit further out.
},
{
    1430.08,1432.76
     If you're on a mat, the toes are actually off the mat.
},
{
    1432.76,1434.04
     The chest is up.
},
{
    1434.88,1437.68
     Bring the hands to your heart and bring the chest
},
{
    1437.68,1441.2
     and come on down and push those glutes, glutes,
},
{
    1441.2,1443.52
     push, push and pinch them at the top.
},
{
    1443.52,1444.96
     Good.
},
{
    1444.96,1445.64
     Good, at the very top, it's almost like you push, and pinch them at the top. Good. Good.
},
{
    1445.64,1449.16
     At the very top, it's almost like you're trying to crack a walnut in your keyster.
},
{
    1449.16,1454.36
     Just come all the way to the top down, and then up, and crack the walnut.
},
{
    1454.36,1455.36
     Good.
},
{
    1455.36,1458.0
     Coming up, and coming up.
},
{
    1458.0,1459.0
     Engage the glutes.
},
{
    1459.0,1460.0
     There we go.
},
{
    1460.0,1464.56
     Let's do about 10 more of these.
},
{
    1464.56,1466.92
     Feel the feet come together.
},
{
    1469.68,1472.2
     That's it, with the power of your glutes.
},
{
    1481.36,1482.36
     There it is, good.
},
{
    1485.82,1487.12
     We're almost there, people. We're almost there people.
},
{
    1487.12,1488.52
     You're doing great.
},
{
    1488.52,1493.12
     You're getting strong legs, strong knees, strong bones.
},
{
    1493.12,1496.12
     All right, let's do a popliteus stretch.
},
{
    1496.12,1498.52
     Popliteus, they call the keys of the knee.
},
{
    1498.52,1503.24
     So find a wall, a door front, a door jam, whatever you like.
},
{
    1503.24,1506.2
     And we're going to just toes are pointing straight ahead.
},
{
    1506.2,1509.72
     Let's bring your heel close to that door jam,
},
{
    1509.72,1513.24
     straighten both legs, chest is up,
},
{
    1513.24,1516.28
     and we're gonna arch your back and come forward like this.
},
{
    1516.28,1519.16
     You're gonna feel that right here behind your kneecap.
},
{
    1519.16,1523.6
     The chest is up, and just breathe into it.
},
{
    1523.6,1527.0
     Don't let that back round. This is a really, really good stretch.
},
{
    1527.0,1531.8
     You brush your teeth, you can do this stretch. You're pumping gas, you can do this stretch.
},
{
    1531.8,1558.0
     This is a phenomenal stretch for you. That pop go ahead and switch. Chest is up, coming forward. Ooh,
},
{
    1558.0,1561.96
     feeling it. Now you might find the hip is out, you won't feel it, or the toes not pointing
},
{
    1561.96,1566.88
     straight ahead and you won't feel it. So bring that hip around chest is up and come right into that.
},
{
    1575.04,1580.32
     Pull the shoulders down. If you want you can do this for two minutes long.
},
{
    1584.4,1596.44
     Hey your knees thank you and I thank you for being here. If you want to go a little deeper, long.
},
