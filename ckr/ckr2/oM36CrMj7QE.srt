{
    29.92,36.52
     I'm just waiting to hear, the number seven is complete, is it really? That's complete there's seven days in a week
},
{
    36.52,38.52

{
    42.16,47.3

{
    68.48,72.48
     Brad and I asked children, this is really sad. We're not liked and now we're trying to turn all around There might be seven people who did like me though, Bob. That'd be a lot. I sat down with a piece of paper
},
{
    72.48,74.48
     If you included your dog, maybe you could
},
{
    74.48,76.48
     Let's get on with the exercises
},
{
    76.48,81.44
     These are the exercises we're gonna do for cervical, we're starting with the upper neck, right? Right
},
{
    82.16,85.16
     You've got neck stiffness, I'm talking about stiffness
},
{
    85.16,89.04
     We're not talking about pain or symptoms that run down the arm
},
{
    89.4,93.44
     You might have pain and stiffness up in the neck or to the shoulder
},
{
    93.44,97.8
     If you've got stuff going down in your arm, we're not gonna treat that here
},
{
    97.8,101.04
     That's more of a McKenzie thing, you may want to watch one of our McKenzie videos
},
{
    101.04,104.04
     Right, we've got MCK ENZ
},
{
    104.72,110.56
     of our McKenzie videos right? Yeah, we've got MCK ENZ We've got lots of them. They know how to find us. Okay, so we're talking about
},
{
    110.56,118.1
     the neck here and we're gonna get closer. Yeah, we should get closer. I had my
},
{
    118.1,122.36
     little red pointer but I lost it. So here we, oh we got a little rubber tube. Yeah
},
{
    122.36,125.36
     what is all that about? That's another video
},
{
    127.36,128.4
     Here you go. Here's your pointer. Oh
},
{
    129.4,131.2
     All right So
},
{
    131.2,133.2
     Man I am just all thumbs today
},
{
    133.8,136.56
     So we're talking about the neck now if you look at the neck
},
{
    136.56,143.2
     We got seven cervical vertebrae and the top two are responsible for 50% of our head movement
},
{
    143.64,150.64
     Right to left. Yeah, so there's a lot going on up here and that as therapists that helps us decide how we're gonna treat
},
{
    150.64,154.74
     So we're gonna give you a quick overview of that. Yeah, generally if I see someone comes in and they have a neck
},
{
    154.74,160.24
     That's not turning. I look at the C1 C2 right away. By the way, you kind of missed something Brad here
},
{
    160.24,166.28
     There's seven cervical spine. Didn't I say that? Yeah, but that goes along with our number seven
},
{
    168.08,170.4
     Precisely. What a sig way, huh?
},
{
    170.96,174.4
     So anyways if you're finding that you're turning like this
},
{
    175.16,180.44
     Chances are you've got some tight muscles up in here in the upper cervical spine
},
{
    180.44,186.36
     Right, but if you can turn your head like 45 degrees each direction and then you're turning your body
},
{
    186.6,192.54
     You're probably loose up in here, but you had a lot of tight muscles in the lower cervical or the lower neck
},
{
    193.4,198.08
     He's tight to the left. Yeah, we're gonna work on it. Let's go after him
},
{
    198.8,207.0
     Maybe we better save his treatment for later Bob. We'll let Gumby take care of it for now.
},
{
    207.0,210.5
     Alright, what's the first one Brad?
},
{
    210.5,215.0
     Okay first one, that's not my favorite chair.
},
{
    215.0,220.2
     First thing we want to do is just maybe the muscles are taped back there for whatever reason.
},
{
    220.2,228.6
     We've done this before but you're gonna go up just below the occipit That's the bone right here go down and when you start to feel some muscle there
},
{
    228.8,231.08
     You're gonna work that and we're gonna splay it out
},
{
    231.76,233.76
     Like this is pulling his fingers apart
},
{
    233.92,235.92
     Right, pulling his fingers apart
},
{
    235.92,242.84
     And if you sit a lot and you're on the computer a lot and your head's forward like this these muscles tighten up
},
{
    242.84,246.8
     Yeah, and so it works out really good to go ahead and do that
},
{
    246.8,249.6
     Spleen massage and also little circles
},
{
    249.6,252.36
     There we go and you're gonna get in there and you'll know
},
{
    252.36,256.6
     I mean you might feel one side is more tender than the other and you'll feel not in there
},
{
    256.6,260.64
     You're gonna you're gonna spend more time on that side. It's hard to believe somebody would not like this
},
{
    260.64,265.96
     It's usually I mean it always feels good even when you don't have anything going on, it feels good right now
},
{
    265.96,271.62
     It's better to have somebody else do it for you, 60 seconds is up Bob, we gotta go to number two
},
{
    271.62,275.92
     Okay our famous chin tucks, and like this
},
{
    278.34,283.92
     Looking at it from the back we're going in and we're stretching, not going down, we're not going up
},
{
    283.96,285.32
     We're going straight back
},
{
    285.32,288.74
     Yeah, like I was gonna right that at the bottom space, okay?
},
{
    289.26,295.0
     But you can see it pulls and gently stretches those same muscles. We just massage
},
{
    295.48,299.68
     Okay, this is a great one to do throughout the day because one not only does it
},
{
    299.68,305.9
     It's good to get the neck moving but two it realigns you where your ears are supposed to be over the shoulders
},
{
    305.9,311.1
     And so when you're if you're finding yourself like this and the ears are lined up with my
},
{
    311.28,312.72
     thighs
},
{
    312.72,317.84
     You need to readjust and get it back into position. It's all about posture. The next one is
},
{
    318.52,321.8
     This one is if this feels good you make a fist
},
{
    322.32,329.06
     Okay, now we've got Mike's turn to fist up like this. Yep so the thumb goes down, but you got to get the thumb back in there
},
{
    329.06,333.28
     Yeah, okay, put it in here right above your sternum and underneath your chin
},
{
    333.92,339.68
     And then just gently grab here and we're gonna use that for a little fulcrum and we're gonna
},
{
    339.68,343.12
     I wonder if they can hear you Brad. So he's using it as a fulcrum
},
{
    343.48,346.9
     The idea here by the way you can you can overdo this
},
{
    347.14,351.26
     So be very gentle with this because you can get a lot of stress on the upper neck with this
},
{
    351.6,355.78
     But this can help loosen up and almost gives a little bit of traction doesn't it?
},
{
    355.78,362.88
     Yep, little bit. You only do this if it feels good. You know, it's like oh boy it feels good. If it doesn't feel good you don't do it
},
{
    363.92,366.8
     Okay, the next one is rotations
},
{
    366.8,374.54
     We're gonna work on rotation particularly if there's one direction and you can see that this one goes about to here and this one is normal
},
{
    376.18,383.48
     Taking a nice towel roll like this or if you happen to have the yoga strap that works really nice as well
},
{
    384.12,387.04
     Any products we talk about or recommend
},
{
    387.04,394.4
     they're always in our description below in the Amazon products. Yep, there we go and this is
},
{
    394.4,401.36
     the one where I like to do the crisscross. So yeah what he did is okay I got my right hand and left
},
{
    401.36,407.6
     hand I'm actually gonna switch them and now I got the right hand on the left strap and the left hand on the right
},
{
    407.6,414.24
     strap and I'm pulling down on this one, right that's just kind of an anchor is what I tell people, and then I go across like this
},
{
    416.8,421.9
     Actually on this one Brad, I actually like the strap better because this strap really can get on different levels
},
{
    421.9,425.46
     If you look it's getting the whole neck, which is fine
},
{
    425.46,431.92
     I definitely would try this, but if you want to get a little more advanced now I can go a little bit lower even
},
{
    432.12,438.8
     and do it again, but notice you always go across the jaw bone, not across the neck like this
},
{
    439.44,442.68
     That will cut off breathing and we like to breathe
},
{
    444.0,446.04
     Air is good
},
{
    446.56,451.68
     Okay, so you can work both directions now if you're in that situation where you can turn
},
{
    452.16,455.84
     Here and then it gets stiff. It's more than likely the lower neck
},
{
    455.84,458.88
     We're gonna start out with again some soft tissue work
},
{
    459.32,467.92
     You can get it back with your hand. It's kind of hard to reach back there unless they got excessively long forearms and fingers. If you have a hook cane like
},
{
    467.92,475.06
     this or you grab a TheraCane or we got the back knobber here and we're
},
{
    475.06,480.3
     going to get back to those muscles and you're just gonna work them, you'll find
},
{
    480.3,483.76
     you'll get on a trigger point and a lot of times I just like to hold pressure
},
{
    483.76,485.72
     there for up to 30 seconds
},
{
    486.12,490.5
     And typically it's gonna feel like it hurts so good and then it actually feels better
},
{
    490.5,496.36
     And when they say it releases after about 30 seconds and when you're done it feels like oh boy that helped
},
{
    496.48,499.28
     Then you know you're doing the right thing. I like to do it a little bit differently
},
{
    499.28,504.32
     I like to get on the spot and I like to do movement with the neck while you're doing it
},
{
    504.32,506.56
     And I find out which one helps so let's say I put it on the spot, and I like to do movement with the neck while you're doing it, and I find out which one helps
},
{
    506.84,512.16
     So let's say I put it on the spot. Let's see have a knot there. I might try chin tucks
},
{
    512.16,514.16
     I might try rotations
},
{
    515.4,517.4
     And I might do side bending
},
{
    517.88,519.88
     I'm gonna see which one
},
{
    520.32,524.2
     Seems to take the pain away, and if there's one I'm gonna keep doing it
},
{
    524.2,530.02
     So usually I try side bending toward the pain first, so I'll go like this and I'll go I'll keep doing it
},
{
    530.02,534.4
     It's like oh that is starting to feel better, then I know I'm on to something so I
},
{
    534.92,540.56
     Like to do the combination of both, right so there's a couple options and you do what works best for you
},
{
    540.56,545.92
     So we're trying to give you tools, yeah, okay Bob you probably want to try this because once again
},
{
    545.92,551.44
     We're gonna work with chin tucks because that also works the lower neck as well as the upper and
},
{
    551.96,555.28
     After you do five or ten of those then we're gonna do
},
{
    557.04,560.48
     extensions and this is really nice to have a support. So we're kind of warming up and
},
{
    560.88,565.28
     Then you know you can start off like Brad likes to do like down like this
},
{
    565.28,567.28
     Yep
},
{
    567.28,569.28
     My neck just cracked a little bit
},
{
    569.28,575.6
     And I'm telling you this is one of those things like you can go back a little further and it feels better when you have the support
},
{
    575.6,577.6
     They're not going to continue to work it
},
{
    577.92,579.92
     But then for some reason it hurts
},
{
    580.4,584.88
     Or gives you pain down your arm you stop all these and it's a different treatment
},
{
    584.88,588.24
     And again why I like to strap for this one now is now I can work my way up
},
{
    588.24,588.74
     Sure
},
{
    588.74,594.16
     The same thing again or work my way down and I work and I like to when I do it that way then I like to have it
},
{
    594.36,600.46
     My thumbs right here. My eyes are following the thumbs. I'm not going like this. I'm going like this
},
{
    601.02,609.6
     This is a different way of doing it as opposed to doing like this where you do not, so follow the thumbs or the little bunny ears, I don't know
},
{
    609.6,615.66
     whatever you want to make. The next one very similar to the previous upper
},
{
    615.66,622.3
     neck, we're doing the rotation, sometimes I may pull over down here
},
{
    622.3,626.86
     it seems to emphasize lower on the neck and that's up to the individual
},
{
    627.26,629.58
     Hope my mic is working here
},
{
    630.06,633.82
     So I'm not gonna spend a lot of time with that because we have just done it
},
{
    633.82,638.26
     And the last one this is a kind of a fun one because when this one works it works really well
},
{
    638.26,642.22
     I think you should show on the spine first, yeah, let's do that. Got your little pin?
},
{
    642.82,644.82
     Yeah, I guess a red one too
},
{
    645.34,649.62
     So there's these little bumps are called spinous processes
},
{
    650.02,653.1
     And so you can feel them on your neck if you feel back there
},
{
    653.1,658.88
     That's what you're feeling is those bumps. There's always a big one that's C7 like right here
},
{
    659.1,663.76
     What you do is you're gonna grab with that and you're gonna actually pull and
},
{
    664.22,667.7
     help the spine move and get it moving and
},
{
    669.0,671.32
     We're actually doing this through your skin
},
{
    671.48,673.0
     So it's a little
},
{
    673.0,675.74
     You don't get a good grip on it like you do on the spine
},
{
    675.74,679.3
     But I've had a lot of success with this in the clinic with people
},
{
    679.6,687.64
     And it's an experiment again because you'll grab onto the spine and then maybe have them turn Right and if that goes, oh that makes it worse stop
},
{
    687.64,693.44
     Then you might try going up a little higher a little lower grab the spine above it and move it
},
{
    693.76,700.44
     Can you see that Lonnie where I'm going to rotate to the right and I'm pulling thee to the left
},
{
    700.44,704.2
     Right, so I'm pulling this way and it's pretty subtle and
},
{
    708.16,715.12
     the left, so I'm pulling this way and it's pretty subtle and this should feel better like oh man that feels good and I can rotate more your right on, if it hurts just forget about it, forget about
},
{
    715.12,722.24
     it, forget about it, those are some good hints Brad, I think you did well, remember Brad and I can,
},
{
    722.24,727.64
     we haven't said this in a while, remember Brad and I can fix just about anything except a broken heart.
},
{
    727.64,730.92
     But we're continue to work on it. There it is.
},
