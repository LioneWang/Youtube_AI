     In this video I'm going to show you how to crack your upper and middle back.
},
{
    4.2,7.16
     It's seriously going to make your back feel like a million bucks.
},
{
    7.16,8.16
     Stay tuned.
},
{
    8.16,16.32
     Hey everyone, Dietro here at SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan.
},
{
    16.32,21.84
     So this is a very easy way to open up your upper and middle backs, especially right in
},
{
    21.84,23.56
     between those shoulder blades.
},
{
    23.56,27.36
     If you have a lot of discomfort going on from leaning forward too much or you just feel like
},
{
    27.36,32.2
     you need to get that to self-release, self-adjust, this is going to be one of the safest and
},
{
    32.2,34.48
     easiest ways to be able to do it.
},
{
    34.48,36.72
     All you need is a standard foam roller.
},
{
    36.72,40.6
     I'm using one that's about 18 inches wide.
},
{
    40.6,42.4
     You can pretty much get them anywhere.
},
{
    42.4,46.54
     You can get them online at Amazon or go to your local shopping center
},
{
    46.54,47.78
     like Walmart and Pick One Up.
},
{
    47.78,49.36
     They're very inexpensive.
},
{
    49.36,51.36
     So to start off with, let's go through this
},
{
    51.36,52.92
     in a progressive step to make sure
},
{
    52.92,55.74
     that we're going to target the middle and upper back
},
{
    55.74,57.44
     to help itself release.
},
{
    57.44,60.2
     The first part is we need to put the foam roller
},
{
    60.2,63.96
     right at the lower part of the thoracic spine.
},
{
    63.96,65.52
     Make sure not to put it over the
},
{
    65.52,70.2
     lumbar spine. When you foam roll the lower back it tends to irritate it so we
},
{
    70.2,74.48
     don't want to do that. What you want to do from there is just lift your hips up.
},
{
    74.48,78.72
     So lift that butt up off the floor and from there you're just going to slowly
},
{
    78.72,87.0
     start to roll across the mid-back all the way up to the upper back, just very, very slowly.
},
{
    87.0,92.0
     And this right here, you're going to want to extend back into it while you do it.
},
{
    92.0,95.0
     Actually, I just felt a really good pop right there in my back.
},
{
    95.0,100.0
     When you do this with the extension in the thoracic spine as you roll,
},
{
    100.0,104.0
     you're going to notice that you're going to get cracks, pops.
},
{
    104.0,109.38
     It's going to self-release through that natural movement.
},
{
    109.38,113.24
     When you do this, it's also going to loosen up the muscle.
},
{
    113.24,117.08
     If you feel like this is all you need, you're good to go.
},
{
    117.08,121.96
     If you feel like one spot is just seriously locked up and it really just needs to get
},
{
    121.96,125.06
     cracked, self-release, that self-adjustment that you're
},
{
    125.06,126.06
     looking for.
},
{
    126.06,127.88
     Let's do this next step.
},
{
    127.88,131.8
     So I'm going to roll over the spot that feels like it just needs to go.
},
{
    131.8,138.44
     I'm going to then put my arms up like this and I'm going to extend as far back as I can.
},
{
    138.44,144.36
     You should really pinpoint that spot in the spine over the center of the foam roller.
},
{
    144.36,147.46
     Just let your hands get taken down like this
},
{
    147.46,148.76
     through gravity.
},
{
    148.76,151.32
     And if it doesn't feel like it releases at that point
},
{
    151.32,153.44
     or cracks, put your hands together
},
{
    153.44,155.84
     and then just slowly bring them down
},
{
    155.84,157.66
     in a very quick motion like this.
},
{
    157.66,160.46
     It's going to put an extra burst of extension
},
{
    160.46,162.56
     over that spot of the spine.
},
{
    162.56,165.72
     And the odds are it should get it to self release.
},
{
    165.72,168.4
     You can also put your arms like this,
},
{
    168.4,170.24
     your hands behind your head,
},
{
    170.24,173.24
     and do a weaning motion also
},
{
    173.24,175.2
     to see if that helps a little bit easier.
},
{
    175.2,176.72
     So I'm gonna go right over that spot
},
{
    176.72,179.6
     that feels like it needs to be self adjusted, self cracked.
},
{
    179.6,182.08
     And I'm going to then extend into it,
},
{
    182.08,183.48
     that is with my upper back,
},
{
    183.48,189.92
     and then I'm going to take my elbows and I'm going to wing them back very quickly like this.
},
{
    189.92,192.82
     Right in between the shoulder blades, I actually felt a very good pop.
},
{
    192.82,196.64
     What that does is it opens up those joints in the thoracic spine and hopefully will get
},
{
    196.64,199.28
     you that cell for the least that you're looking for.
},
{
    199.28,202.28
     A note with these, only go to your comfort level.
},
{
    202.28,203.32
     Don't try to force it.
},
{
    203.32,205.92
     If it's not going to go, it's not going to go.
},
{
    205.92,208.92
     So at that point, visit your local chiropractor instead
},
{
    208.92,210.4
     and get a professional adjustment.
},
{
    210.4,213.6
     And the odds are it's gonna work a lot better for you anyways.
},
{
    213.6,216.16
     So I hope this helps and give it a try.
},
{
    216.16,217.2
     Let us know how it goes.

    217.2,219.16
