},
{
    9.32,13.6
     it's something bad and how to prevent it from ever coming back.
},
{
    13.6,19.4
     So did you have too small of a shoe, too cute of a shoe, run too many miles or hike too
},
{
    19.4,20.4
     many miles?
},
{
    20.4,25.68
     I'm going to show you tips and tricks at home that you can do to get feeling better starting
},
{
    25.68,31.56
     right now.
},
{
    31.56,34.8
     So a quick disclaimer, never do stuff alone at home.
},
{
    34.8,41.2
     That's for click baby purposes, but I am going to show you great tips such as these, such
},
{
    41.2,43.64
     as these that work at home.
},
{
    43.64,46.26
     But first, let us know in the comments,
},
{
    46.26,48.06
     was it too small of a shoe?
},
{
    48.06,48.9
     Is it a bunion?
},
{
    48.9,49.9
     Is it a hammer toe?
},
{
    49.9,53.46
     Is it your heels slipping and rubbing along the back?
},
{
    53.46,55.34
     Is the shoe too cute and too tight
},
{
    55.34,58.3
     and you want tips and tricks on how to fix it?
},
{
    58.3,60.1
     Or did you run too many miles?
},
{
    60.1,61.54
     We love knowing this stuff.
},
{
    61.54,63.18
     Comment, let us know.
},
{
    63.18,65.28
     Tell us if this video helped or didn't help.
},
{
    65.28,72.64
     So the first thing is your blister. Is it dangerous? If it's red, if it's hot, if there's thick,
},
{
    72.64,79.36
     mucus drainage coming out of it, it is infected. You have to let your pediatricist know immediately.
},
{
    79.36,86.64
     Here's the thing. 90% of people will be okay by cleaning it off with soap and water and putting antibiotic
},
{
    86.64,93.08
     ointment on it. It is possible to drain this blister at home, but it's dangerous. And
},
{
    93.08,97.64
     what happens is if it gets infected, you could get cellulitis and end up in the hospital.
},
{
    97.64,103.56
     I see this a lot. A lot of the times, if you have a relationship with a pediatrist, people
},
{
    103.56,109.36
     just call me up and I can electronically send them an antibiotic until they can come see me.
},
{
    109.36,113.88
     Because a lot of the times you go to the ER, you're waiting for 12 hours anyway, and what
},
{
    113.88,117.84
     happens is you end up getting an antibiotic and refer to a podiatrist anyway.
},
{
    117.84,124.1
     So call your podiatrist's office if you're worried, if you're even suggesting that there
},
{
    124.1,126.36
     might be an infection, take great
},
{
    126.36,127.36
     care of you.
},
{
    127.36,132.06
     Doctors will get you in and they want to help you, but I understand if you can't do that.
},
{
    132.06,134.5
     So this is the unofficial guide right here.
},
{
    134.5,139.94
     If it's red, if it's hot, if there's pus draining out of it, it's probably infected.
},
{
    139.94,145.36
     If you have nausea, if you feel like vomiting, if you have chills, that's more of an emergency.
},
{
    145.36,146.96
     You should get to the hospital.
},
{
    146.96,153.2
     But what you want to do is clean soap, clean it off, wash your hands as much as possible,
},
{
    153.2,155.64
     clean all that dirt out of the blister.
},
{
    155.64,158.8
     And what you want to do is get topical antibiotic ointment.
},
{
    158.8,162.76
     So like neosporin, triple antibiotic ointment, sylvanine is good.
},
{
    162.76,165.84
     There's a lot of great stuff at a CBS, but again,
},
{
    165.84,172.12
     officially you should be seeing your doctor. But should you pop it at home, a lot of the
},
{
    172.12,177.6
     times that there's a thick blister, I in the office will pop it, but people hurt themselves,
},
{
    177.6,182.8
     especially if you're diabetic, if you smoke, if you have blood flow problems, healthy people,
},
{
    182.8,190.5
     95 plus percent of the time, they're going to gonna be okay but just be safe. Check with the doctor if you're worried but the truth
},
{
    190.5,195.16
     is realistically most people will be okay and can heal this stuff but if
},
{
    195.16,199.28
     there's infection you need an antibiotic. What you want to do is you want to get
},
{
    199.28,204.76
     padding so get yourself a band-aid. There's a lot of great bandages online.
},
{
    204.76,205.0
     There's waterproof bandages, there's a lot of great bandages online.
},
{
    205.0,208.92
     There's waterproof bandages, there's the basic bandages.
},
{
    208.92,212.16
     You want some antibiotic cream to put on there.
},
{
    212.16,214.28
     Is it on your big toe joint?
},
{
    214.28,216.16
     Is it on your heel?
},
{
    216.16,217.96
     Is it on your fifth toe?
},
{
    217.96,219.86
     These are common areas that are rubbing.
},
{
    219.86,222.44
     So get a bandaid, get some antibiotic ointment.
},
{
    222.44,224.04
     Stop doing what you're doing.
},
{
    224.04,226.08
     So cut down on your mileage.
},
{
    226.08,227.64
     And the next thing you wanna do is
},
{
    227.64,230.02
     make sure your shoe fits properly.
},
{
    230.02,232.56
     We have a great guide that I'm gonna link right here
},
{
    232.56,235.06
     that will help you fit your shoe properly.
},
{
    235.06,238.1
     But common problems are it's too tight in the front.
},
{
    238.1,240.72
     So you can see these are pointy in the front.
},
{
    240.72,241.88
     It's too tight in the back.
},
{
    241.88,249.64
     So you can see dressier shoes are too tight in the back. People fit their shoes when their foot's not swollen and then during the day
},
{
    249.64,256.28
     the foot swells. That's why the shoes too tight. Number two, people don't measure their
},
{
    256.28,260.86
     foot size when they're standing. You have to stand because when you stand your foot
},
{
    260.86,266.08
     expands about half the size or a full size. So these are some of the common problems we like
},
{
    266.08,267.72
     in that video that I mentioned.
},
{
    267.72,271.36
     So check out our guide to fit your shoe at home
},
{
    271.36,272.88
     without specialized equipment.
},
{
    272.88,274.12
     We can help you with that.
},
{
    274.12,276.36
     This is a shoe stretching device.
},
{
    276.36,278.84
     So essentially this is like $15 online
},
{
    278.84,280.84
     and the show notes are down below.
},
{
    280.84,282.08
     So if you want these, check it out.
},
{
    282.08,284.72
     But look, I set up a couple pegs
},
{
    284.72,285.36
     and once for the
},
{
    285.36,290.56
     bunny and Taylor's bunny in fifth toe and big toe so you can see right here they correlate
},
{
    290.56,296.8
     and essentially that twisting metal rod makes them stretch out and essentially the heel stretches
},
{
    296.8,301.52
     out the heel area so you could see right there the bumps correlate to prominent blister areas on
},
{
    301.52,305.08
     your foot so in this case if you're're gonna blister in the fifth toe,
},
{
    305.08,308.4
     the little toe, you have a bunion or a tailor's bunion,
},
{
    308.4,311.5
     just get this guy, stick it in here,
},
{
    311.5,313.86
     and you leave it on for 24 hours overnight.
},
{
    313.86,317.16
     And see this back part that I'm twisting right here?
},
{
    317.16,318.4
     That's for the heel.
},
{
    318.4,322.1
     So in the front, the metal rod basically expands that.
},
{
    322.1,323.4
     So see, that's expanding,
},
{
    323.4,326.0
     and you leave that for 24 hours overnight.
},
{
    326.0,332.26
     And that will stretch out your tailors bunion. So the tailors bunion is the little toe and the bunion is the big toe.
},
{
    332.26,336.26
     Or the side of the foot if you're getting problems there and that back part, look at that.
},
{
    336.26,339.0
     I'm stretching that out, that's stretching out the heel area.
},
{
    339.0,344.76
     So if you're getting heel blisters or back of the heel blisters, especially in your high heeled shoes,
},
{
    344.76,346.04
     that can stretch
},
{
    346.04,349.8
     that area out, take a little bit of pressure off there. Or if the tongue is pressing too
},
{
    349.8,355.08
     tightly on the top, stick that tongue part on there and that will get pressure off the
},
{
    355.08,360.76
     top of the foot. And then as that's sitting overnight for like $5 to $10 shoe stretch
},
{
    360.76,365.52
     spray, just take that and you spray that area. Essentially it moistens it
},
{
    365.52,371.92
     a little bit and then it kind of stiffens up in that position so it stays stretched out.
},
{
    371.92,375.84
     So that spray is a great idea. I use that quite a bit. You know personally I always
},
{
    375.84,380.24
     go with good pediatrics recommended shoes but if you wear the fancy high heeled shoes
},
{
    380.24,386.28
     or ones that are tight in the front, the shoe stretch spray can be great. So spray it overnight.
},
{
    386.28,389.56
     It can't go up five shoe sizes if you have a tiny shoe,
},
{
    389.56,393.52
     but it can go up, for example, one to two shoe sizes.
},
{
    393.52,394.64
     It can spread out the front.
},
{
    394.64,396.18
     It can spread out the heel.
},
{
    396.18,397.4
     So that's a shoe stretcher.
},
{
    397.4,400.24
     That thing for two of them, it's like 15 bucks.
},
{
    400.24,401.4
     Moisturize.
},
{
    401.4,403.4
     If you don't have a blister already,
},
{
    403.4,407.12
     get some petroleum jelly, get some wax.
},
{
    407.12,412.36
     There's specific anti-blister creams that are more expensive, that are thicker than
},
{
    412.36,417.32
     petroleum jelly, but petroleum jelly is like three bucks at any grocery store.
},
{
    417.32,422.28
     This works great, especially if you put it on overtape or mix it up with tape.
},
{
    422.28,424.84
     Don't put the jelly then the tape, it won't stick.
},
{
    424.84,428.8
     There's specialized creams like this that can work well but these are harder to
},
{
    428.8,431.94
     get. You probably don't have it at home. Deodorant. Just rub it against the back
},
{
    431.94,435.72
     of the heel, the back of the Achilles tendon, the bunion. If you're in a pinch
},
{
    435.72,440.04
     just grab this. This will help quite a bit. It'll lubricate your foot. If your
},
{
    440.04,443.76
     feet are moist and sweat a lot, there's a lot of powders online. We're gonna link
},
{
    443.76,448.2
     some down in the show notes but cornstarch, talcum powder, there's
},
{
    448.2,452.42
     specific anti fungus and anti athletes foot creams.
},
{
    452.42,455.24
     There are great anti-perspirant sprays.
},
{
    455.24,461.32
     Check the show note for sprays, anti sweat, anti stick stuff that will really help your
},
{
    461.32,462.32
     feet.
},
{
    462.32,463.76
     So there are gel pads like this.
},
{
    463.76,467.54
     So you could see this one goes on to the heel like this.
},
{
    467.54,469.84
     So these types of gel pads, they work really well.
},
{
    469.84,471.12
     They can stop your heel.
},
{
    471.12,474.2
     And number two, if you have a bandaid already,
},
{
    474.2,475.68
     put some duct tape over it.
},
{
    475.68,478.24
     So duct tape on the heel, on the big toe,
},
{
    478.24,481.32
     it sticks better, you can keep walking and going to work,
},
{
    481.32,482.96
     and the skin won't rub,
},
{
    482.96,485.5
     but you don't wanna put that directly on the blister
},
{
    485.5,487.54
     because it will make the blister worse.
},
{
    487.54,489.42
     Good socks, get yourself some good socks.
},
{
    489.42,491.56
     So thin socks that are synthetic,
},
{
    491.56,493.74
     that specifically wick moisture,
},
{
    493.74,494.9
     spend a couple extra bucks.
},
{
    494.9,498.74
     They're like five bucks or 10 bucks online now on Amazon.
},
{
    498.74,499.58
     Are you kidding me?
},
{
    499.58,500.66
     It's just Gatam.
},
{
    500.66,501.62
     Don't even think about it.
},
{
    501.62,507.2
     You don't have to buy like $50 socks like back in the day, but cotton socks, synthetic
},
{
    507.2,512.2
     socks, as long as they're not crummy socks and make sure, see how there's no stitching
},
{
    512.2,517.08
     here, make sure you don't have thick stitching in the front that's rubbing on your toes.
},
{
    517.08,519.88
     Socks can be very important and beneficial for you.
},
{
    519.88,523.64
     And again, down in the show notes, we link some great socks.
},
{
    523.64,528.08
     Get great shoes. Down in the show notes, we show you our best running shoes
},
{
    528.08,531.24

     Check down there.

{
    532.48,535.28

{
    535.28,537.72
     we got you covered in all brands.
},
{
    537.72,540.84
     So the keys are great fitting shoes, stop sweating,
},
{
    540.84,545.28
     moisturize the rubbing areas, get bandages, get band-aids.
},
{
    545.28,548.18
     And lastly, you can even do something like KT tape.
},
{
    548.18,550.24
     They work great, but they're a little bit expensive.
},
{
    550.24,553.36
     Check down in the show notes for all this great stuff.
},
{
    553.36,554.92
     It will help you.
},
{
    554.92,557.72
     Good luck, and we hope your foot pain blister feels better.
