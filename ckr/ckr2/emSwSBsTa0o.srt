     Thank you. I'd like to go on to perform an abdominal examination today, is that alright?
},
{
    19.48,23.84
     So just to clarify, that will involve looking at your hands, going over your head and checking
},
{
    23.84,29.44
     for any areas of pain or tenderness and problems on your tummy. Is that okay? Excellent.
},
{
    29.8,36.76
     So to start off with, if I could take a deep breath in for you please.

    132.0,136.0
     Excellent, thank you.

},
{
    142.0,147.0
     If I get you to turn around and face this way for me.
},

If I could take your shirt off now and we'll do the abdominal

     examination. Is there going to be any problems lying you flat?
},
{

{
    210.0,221.0

},
{
    221.0,222.0
     And out.
},
{
    222.0,228.36
     Thank you. Now before we go on are there any areas of pain or tenderness
},
{
    228.36,232.12
     on your stomach at the moment? Excellent. Okay so I'm just going to go around lightly
},
{
    232.12,248.6
     across your abdomen. Okay any problems with that? Nope.. I'm going to go a little bit deeper now.
},
{
    248.6,256.12
     Okay, any problems there?
},
{
    256.12,257.12
     No.
},
{
    257.12,260.48
     I'm now going to have a look for your liver and then your spleen.
},
{
    260.48,266.0
     If you can breathe in for me please. And out. Breathe in.
},
{
    266.0,268.0

},
{
    274.0,276.0
     And out.
},
{
    276.0,278.0
     I'm now going to tap down across your chest.
},
{
    284.0,286.2
     That's fine.
},
{
    286.2,287.2
     Now same again.

    318.8,321.6
     There we go. Right, any problems there? Okay, press back.
},
{
    324.24,325.0
     And again, just going to press down hard.
},
{
    325.0,329.0
     Okay, that's fine.
},
{
    329.0,332.0
     I'm just going to have a listen over your stomach for a moment.
},
{
    340.0,342.0
     Okay, thank you.
},
{
    342.0,344.0
     For the final bit, I'm just going to sit you up again,
},
{
    344.0,345.22
     and I'm going to
},
{
    345.22,351.48
     put some heavy pressure over your abdomen. Alright? Okay, you're going to lean back
},
{
    351.48,356.24
     for me. Okay, so I'm now going to press quite firmly on your stomach, so if you can get
},
{
    356.24,367.0
     it to turn your head that way for me, and I'm finally just going to press down over your shins.
},
{
    373.48,377.76
     That's fine. Thank you. So to finish off things, what I'd like to do is I'd like to get a sample
},
{
    377.76,382.32
     of urine and have a look at that. We'd also do a check of the external genitalia and a
},
{
    382.32,385.56
     digital rectal examination. Okay. Thank you very much.
},
