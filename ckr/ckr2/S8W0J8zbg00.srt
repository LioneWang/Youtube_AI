     So are you dealing with a nagging pain in your neck and you just need to get rid of it?
},
{
    4.32,7.8
     Well stay tuned because in this video I'm going to show three different ways on how
},
{
    7.8,15.24
     to get rid of a pain in your neck quickly.
},
{
    15.24,18.82
     Hey everyone, Dr. O here at SpineCare in St. Joseph, Michigan.
},
{
    18.82,22.96
     So maybe you just woke up with a pain in your neck, maybe you've just been at the computer
},
{
    22.96,25.88
     too long or just looking forward and pain is just
},
{
    25.88,26.88
     creeping up.
},
{
    26.88,31.12
     Well, what we're going to do is break this down into three different ways to target a
},
{
    31.12,35.86
     pain in your neck, including the upper part of the neck, middle part, and lower.
},
{
    35.86,40.16
     So if you have a pinpoint spot that needs a little bit more attention, we're really
},
{
    40.16,45.72
     going to focus on those areas and hopefully get you a lot of pain relief quickly.
},
{
    45.72,47.28
     Let's get started with it.
},
{
    47.28,51.88
     With the first exercise, we're going to focus on the top part of the neck, especially right
},
{
    51.88,53.76
     here at the base of the skull.
},
{
    53.76,57.56
     It usually gets strained from too much forward leaning.
},
{
    57.56,63.24
     Using cell phones, driving, you name it, there's a lot of that in the modern world.
},
{
    63.24,69.0
     We're going to help counterbalance that with this stretch. Take two fingers and sit in the chair
},
{
    69.0,72.92
     with good upright posture and then you're just going to drive the chin back
},
{
    72.92,78.2
     as far as you feel comfortable with. You should start to feel a stretch right in
},
{
    78.2,81.84
     the top part of the neck all the way down and only go to your comfort level.
},
{
    81.84,87.8
     Hold this for about 10 to 15 seconds. I'm going to then relax and then do three to five more
},
{
    87.8,89.28
     repetitions of this.
},
{
    89.28,92.96
     The second part of the stretch is then pushing all the way
},
{
    92.96,95.44
     back but then looking up towards the ceiling.
},
{
    95.44,99.0
     You're going to feel a great stretch at the base of the skull
},
{
    99.0,101.2
     and into that top part of the neck.
},
{
    101.2,103.96
     Again, hold this one for about 10 to 15 seconds.
},
{
    103.96,105.0
     You're gonna relax and then for about 10 to 15 seconds. You're going to relax
},
{
    105.0,109.92
     and then repeat that three to five times. It should give you a lot of relief at that
},
{
    109.92,111.28
     top part of the neck.
},
{
    111.28,115.56
     So if you've ever watched any of my other videos, you know that I really like towels
},
{
    115.56,120.88
     to get very good stretches. So with the neck, we're going to take an ordinary hand-drying
},
{
    120.88,129.06
     towel, roll it up like this, and then place it over the level of the part of the neck that you feel is really locked up and is causing a lot of pain.
},
{
    129.06,133.22
     What we do is then just pull on it, costs a little bit of tension right here by
},
{
    133.22,137.78
     pulling into or pulling on it with the two ends and then you're just going to
},
{
    137.78,141.26
     build into some rotation. So if I want to turn towards the left or I'm having
},
{
    141.26,147.24
     difficulty turning towards the left, I'm going to take the right side and then I'm going to pull on it.
},
{
    147.24,150.88
     So you can kind of see how I'm just keeping this one locked and then I'm going to pull
},
{
    150.88,152.26
     on that side.
},
{
    152.26,157.86
     This is going to pinpoint spots into the neck that just really need a little bit more motion
},
{
    157.86,161.48
     and it's going to work a lot of stiffness out of the joint and the muscles.
},
{
    161.48,163.36
     Again, only go to your comfort level.
},
{
    163.36,166.2
     What you want to do is build a little bit of motion in there.
},
{
    166.2,168.28
     Hold that for about 10 to 15 seconds.
},
{
    168.28,169.32
     Relax.
},
{
    169.32,171.16
     Repeat it three to five times, and then just
},
{
    171.16,172.76
     switch to the other side.
},
{
    172.76,175.4
     You can move the towel up and down also
},
{
    175.4,178.64
     to where you feel it's going to pinpoint that spot that needs
},
{
    178.64,180.16
     a little bit more attention.
},
{
    180.16,182.76
     You can also build into a little bit more of a traction
},
{
    182.76,189.92
     with this by then just pointing up towards the ceiling. So what I'm going to do is hold one end completely locked. I'm going to then
},
{
    189.92,197.12
     go upwards almost like towards my eye and then just get a little bit of a stretch. This is a really
},
{
    197.12,202.32
     good way to traction the neck open and hopefully give you a little bit of pain relief. So give it
},
{
    202.32,205.22
     a try. So let's target the lower part of the neck
},
{
    205.22,207.74
     and also the upper part of the back
},
{
    207.74,210.76
     with a nice extension exercise.
},
{
    210.76,213.8
     Again, a lot of issues are caused from forward posture,
},
{
    213.8,216.64
     so what we're going to do is try to bring the shoulders back,
},
{
    216.64,218.88
     also bring the head back to help relax
},
{
    218.88,220.84
     a lot of those muscles and joints.
},
{
    220.84,222.92
     What I do is I just place the upper part of the back
},
{
    222.92,225.24
     against the back of the chair.
},
{
    225.24,229.38
     I'm going to take my hands, place them at the back of my head, and then I'm going to
},
{
    229.38,232.72
     then just simply put a little bit of pressure in my upper back.
},
{
    232.72,237.16
     I'm going to lean into the chair, and then I'm going to wing my elbows back as far as
},
{
    237.16,238.64
     I feel comfortable.
},
{
    238.64,244.36
     You should feel a very good stretch in the upper part of the back and also into the lower
},
{
    244.36,245.6
     part of the neck. Hold this the lower part of the neck.
},
{
    245.6,247.64
     Hold this one for up to 15 seconds.
},
{
    247.64,251.52
     You're just going to relax and then repeat that three to five times.
},
{
    251.52,268.4
     Again, only go to your comfort level with this.
},
