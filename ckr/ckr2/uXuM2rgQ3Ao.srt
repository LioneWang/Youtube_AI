     Hello everybody, it's Dr. Jo. Today I'm going to show you some breathing exercises to help
},
{
    18.48,23.2
     you relax, hopefully increase your oxygen levels, and maybe lower your heart rate just
},
{
    23.2,28.4
     a little bit. A great way to know if you're doing that is to use a pulse oximeter and I have a
},
{
    28.4,37.8
     nice one here that Choice and Med sent me. They're pretty simple to use. Just take
},
{
    37.8,43.56
     them out of the box, press the button, and then put them on your finger. So to
},
{
    43.56,46.36
     help you get some deep breathing will
},
{
    46.36,51.88
     increase your oxygen levels. So what I like to do is breathe in through your
},
{
    51.88,57.44
     nose for about five seconds and then breathe out through your mouth for seven
},
{
    57.44,60.52
     seconds. So you're actually blowing out more than you breathe in. So that's
},
{
    60.52,70.3
     that's getting some in and then getting all the bad stuff out. So you're just going in and then out.
},
{
    74.58,81.72
     Seven. And so as you can see my oxygen level is going up. It's at about 99%
},
{
    81.72,85.46
     pretty high heart rate right now because I'm talking a lot but
},
{
    85.46,90.2
     as I go it'll start to lower a little bit more so one more time breathing in
},
{
    90.2,107.08
     through your nose for five seconds and then out through your mouth for seven seconds.
},
{
    107.08,113.64
     And if you do that for about two or three minutes, that will help relax you a little bit, de-stress
},
{
    113.64,118.68
     you, increase those oxygen levels, which will give you a little more energy, and then lower
},
{
    118.68,131.12
     that heart rate, which will calm you as well. So one last time, five seconds in through the nose and seven
},
{
    131.12,134.16
     seconds out through the mouth.
},
{
    138.2,142.72
     I know you feel calmer already. I think I'm gonna take a nap. So if you have any
