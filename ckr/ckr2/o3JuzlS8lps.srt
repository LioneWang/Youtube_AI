},
{
    19.44,20.96
     Today we're gonna talk about yes,
},
{
    20.96,24.64
     you need to fix your rounded shoulders, you look bad.
},
{
    24.64,26.32

},
{
    26.32,29.36
     Understand, understand this, we're not judging.
},
{
    29.36,31.44
     I still have rounded shoulders.
},
{
    31.44,32.84
     I fight it every day.
},
{
    32.84,33.8
     I'm working on it all the time.
},
{
    33.8,34.64
     I do.
},
{
    34.64,36.42
     And I think I've improved since,
},
{
    36.42,38.0
     if you look at our old videos.
},
{
    38.0,39.04

{
    76.16,78.44
     So you wanna fix your rounded shoulders.
},
{
    78.44,80.96
     This, I'm gonna first show you a test, Brad,
},
{
    80.96,83.36
     that you can do to see if you have rounded shoulders.
},
{
    83.36,84.68
     Can I stand up, Liz?
},
{
    84.68,86.32
     All right, Liz says I can stand up.
},
{
    86.32,88.88
     So, you still got his head in there?
},
{
    88.88,89.72
     Yeah, I really do.
},
{
    89.72,92.92
     You know, that's why I got a face for radio.
},
{
    92.92,94.92
     So, you're gonna look at your thumbs,
},
{
    94.92,96.2
     is what you're gonna do.
},
{
    96.2,98.66
     If, as you just stand here normally,
},
{
    98.66,100.8
     look how my thumbs are pointing towards each other.
},
{
    100.8,101.76
     Oh, when you're standing, yeah.
},
{
    101.76,103.76
     Yeah, that means my shoulders
},
{
    103.76,105.68
     are a little bit internally rotated.
},
{
    105.68,108.68
     Yeah, so this, I don't know if you can see the white stripe,
},
{
    108.68,111.56
     but from here to here, big difference
},
{
    111.56,112.48
     in how things are working.
},
{
    112.48,114.0
     Now straighten up one spread.
},
{
    114.0,115.64
     Straighten up and watch the thumbs.
},
{
    115.64,118.88
     The thumbs start pointing towards the front now.
},
{
    118.88,120.44
     That's what you want.
},
{
    120.44,121.6
     Where you're walking, yeah.
},
{
    121.6,125.06
     Now the first thing, the first three step program,
},
{
    125.06,126.0
     watch this once.
},
{
    126.0,129.64
     If I round my upper back, watch what it does to my shoulders.
},
{
    131.28,132.12
     See my shoulders.
},
{
    132.12,132.96
     They come towards me Bob.
},
{
    132.96,134.64
     Yeah, and they've rounded, but watch my thumbs.
},
{
    134.64,135.48
     Oh yeah.
},
{
    135.48,138.52
     Watch, okay, my thumbs are straight forward.
},
{
    138.52,140.4
     Now I'm gonna just round my upper back.
},
{
    140.4,141.24
     Look at that.
},
{
    141.24,142.52
     They go right towards each other.
},
{
    142.52,143.6
     Is that a little magnet?
},
{
    143.6,145.04
     So it is critical.
},
{
    145.04,147.0
     If you wanna improve your posture
},
{
    147.0,148.84
     and you wanna improve the rounded shoulders,
},
{
    148.84,152.36
     you gotta fix that mid to upper back,
},
{
    152.36,154.2
     this area up in here.
},
{
    154.2,156.76
     One of the best ways we have found for doing this
},
{
    156.76,158.96
     is actually just take a couple of balls
},
{
    158.96,161.32
     or even one tennis ball.
},
{
    161.32,163.36
     And if you wanna come back here, Brad.
},
{
    163.36,167.76
     And what you're gonna do is you're gonna lie on these things
},
{
    167.76,170.14
     and you're gonna hit these different spots,
},
{
    170.14,173.92
     like here, here, here, here, here, here.
},
{
    173.92,176.64
     And you can start off by actually doing it up
},
{
    176.64,177.96
     against the wall, do you mind doing that, Brad?
},
{
    177.96,178.8
     Oh, sure.
},
{
    178.8,181.36
     So the whole idea is we're trying to,
},
{
    181.36,184.2
     if you are tight in the thoracic rib cage
},
{
    184.2,186.0
     where we're talking about, we're gonna loosen that up
},
{
    186.0,188.84
     so this posture is possible.
},
{
    188.84,190.84
     Yeah, if you've been doing it for a number of years,
},
{
    190.84,193.24
     this area can really tighten up.
},
{
    193.24,195.28
     I mean, it's got heavy ligaments
},
{
    195.28,197.24
     that hold the bones together.
},
{
    197.24,199.64
     So that's why we have you start against the wall,
},
{
    199.64,203.16
     because this can be a very aggressive treatment,
},
{
    203.16,205.52
     but when you do it against the wall,
},
{
    205.52,207.84
     you can control how much pressure
},
{
    207.84,208.96
     you're putting against it.
},
{
    208.96,210.48
     And the reason we use a sock,
},
{
    210.48,212.4
     you can see I can easily control.
},
{
    212.4,213.24
     Yeah, you can move it around.
},
{
    213.24,215.6
     Where it is, I'm gonna be on the left side of the spine,
},
{
    215.6,218.56
     and you can roll up and down, you don't have to.
},
{
    218.56,220.4
     And I'm pushing in pretty aggressively.
},
{
    220.4,221.76
     And even do a little bit of this, Brad, right?
},
{
    221.76,223.44
     Yeah, there you go, that's a good idea.
},
{
    223.44,224.28
     Ooh.
},
{
    224.28,227.46
     Even do, even some angels while you're doing that. Someday, Brad, right? Yeah, there you go. That's a good idea. Ooh. Even do some angels while you're doing that.
},
{
    227.46,228.46
     Someday, Brad, right?
},
{
    228.46,229.46
     You'll be an angel.
},
{
    229.46,231.08
     Well, yeah, when the bell rings.
},
{
    231.08,233.58
     You're moving every time the bell rings,
},
{
    233.58,234.96
     you get some wings.
},
{
    234.96,238.28
     Yeah, so now, as soon as you're able,
},
{
    238.28,242.4
     I want you to progress to lying on the floor.
},
{
    242.4,244.6
     And that's gonna be a lot more aggressive.
},
{
    244.6,246.76
     I'm gonna do it right here, Brad, even though-
},
{
    246.76,249.64
     Yeah, you would not do it on bed because it wouldn't work.
},
{
    249.64,251.36
     A carpeted floor works really well.
},
{
    251.36,252.82
     So the same thing here.
},
{
    252.82,254.8
     I'm just gonna show you the positioning, basically.
},
{
    254.8,256.38
     I'm gonna put it in place.
},
{
    256.38,259.76
     Now this is, again, very aggressive for a person,
},
{
    259.76,260.8
     first time beginner.
},
{
    260.8,262.72
     You may wanna have a pillow
},
{
    262.72,265.64
     so that the pillow takes off some of the stress.
},
{
    265.64,268.16
     Sometimes we even put some towels over the balls
},
{
    268.16,269.6
     to take some of the stress off.
},
{
    269.6,270.44
     Right, exactly.
},
{
    270.44,271.96
     So it's not so aggressive.
},
{
    271.96,273.32
     Again, with the soft surface,
},
{
    273.32,275.2
     it's not aggressive at all, to be honest with you.
},
{
    275.2,278.16
     But I'm just showing you, when it's in place like this,
},
{
    278.16,280.48
     you can again roll back and forth on it,
},
{
    280.48,283.4
     or you can do some deep breaths like this
},
{
    283.4,285.52
     with your arms up overhead.
},
{
    285.52,287.12
     And you wanna hit the different spots.
},
{
    287.12,290.08
     What I do every morning, did it this morning,
},
{
    290.08,294.12
     is I lie down on my back and I put my foot up
},
{
    294.12,296.04
     and I'm stretching my hamstring.
},
{
    296.04,300.68
     And I got a railing right there and I lie on this thing.
},
{
    300.68,302.0
     You use a pillow or no?
},
{
    302.0,303.0
     I don't use a pillow.
},
{
    303.0,304.12
     So I want to get used to it.
},
{
    304.12,306.4
     You may feel comfortable without the pillow.
},
{
    306.4,310.16
     Right, but that works better than anything I found
},
{
    310.16,312.0
     for improving my posture up here.
},
{
    312.0,315.08
     I've pretty much eliminated having pain up there
},
{
    315.08,316.32
     as far as knots.
},
{
    316.32,317.76
     Right, so because-
},
{
    317.76,319.04
     So you're getting,
},
{
    319.04,321.32
     oh, in your case, you're getting a hamstring stretch,
},
{
    321.32,322.64
     you're working on your posture
},
{
    322.64,324.56
     and you're relaxing those muscles.
},
{
    324.56,327.44
     That's right. I go triple task there.
},
{
    327.44,329.36
     Multi-task times three, yep.
},
{
    329.36,333.1
     All right, the next one, as an alternative to that,
},
{
    333.1,335.52
     you might try a ball in a chair, Brad.
},
{
    335.52,337.96
     Oh, you're just gonna say a ball in a chain.
},
{
    337.96,340.3
     Wow.
},
{
    340.3,342.8
     Don't you even make any jokes about that, Brad.
},
{
    342.8,343.88
     Okay.
},
{
    343.88,347.08
     But no, you take a soft ball that squishy.
},
{
    347.08,348.82
     This is like that kick ball kind.
},
{
    348.82,350.48
     This says crane on it.
},
{
    350.48,353.28
     I bought this at a store at the end.
},
{
    353.28,354.66
     It's like, it was like $3.
},
{
    354.66,356.84
     That completely brings me back to my childhood.
},
{
    356.84,357.68
     It does.
},
{
    357.68,359.04
     It used to play kick ball.
},
{
    359.04,360.12
     With this type of ball.
},
{
    360.12,361.48
     Yeah, it was fun.
},
{
    361.48,363.0
     So, you know, that's a double lamb.
},
{
    363.0,366.4
     You get to enjoy your history if you're 50 years older. Yeah, a was fun. So, you know, that's a double whammy. You get to enjoy your history if you're 50 years or older.
},
{
    366.4,368.24
     Yeah, a little nostalgia.
},
{
    368.24,372.08
     And now, so the soft ball allows you to roll into it.
},
{
    372.08,373.2
     But look what he's doing here.
},
{
    373.2,376.28
     He's extending, but he's gonna externally rotate
},
{
    376.28,377.12
     at the same time.
},
{
    377.12,378.08
     Right.
},
{
    378.08,380.2
     So we're doing breathing in,
},
{
    381.16,384.76
     and exhale and relax and arch over that ball
},
{
    384.76,385.0
     and arms back
},
{
    386.08,389.44
     so we're getting a complete stretch
},
{
    389.44,391.28
     to get that posture where we want it to go.
},
{
    391.28,393.72
     You might adjust the ball up and down
},
{
    393.72,395.92
     and I wouldn't say might but you should.
},
{
    395.92,398.48
     You'll find at certain locations it feels better
},
{
    398.48,401.12
     and you may and probably will feel your back
},
{
    401.12,402.04
     do a little cracking.
},
{
    402.04,403.08
     Sure.
},
{
    403.08,404.84
     This was really a nice exercise
},
{
    404.84,408.24
     because it's actually leading into the second phase
},
{
    408.24,410.6
     of what you need to do to fix your rounded shoulders.
},
{
    410.6,414.32
     And that is, you gotta stretch the pectoralis major here
},
{
    414.32,417.28
     and minor and the internal rotators.
},
{
    417.28,419.4
     So internal rotation is this.
},
{
    419.4,423.12
     They bring the shoulder in like this or in like this.
},
{
    423.12,425.64
     That's what internally rotates your shoulders.
},
{
    425.64,428.28
     We wanna stretch them so that
},
{
    428.28,430.32
     you can externally rotate the shoulder.
},
{
    430.32,431.16
     So-
},
{
    431.16,432.0
     That gives the thumbs in the right position.
},
{
    432.0,433.32
     That's one way to do it.
},
{
    433.32,435.52
     Another way is sometimes if you could picture
},
{
    435.52,437.28
     a door frame right here,
},
{
    437.28,439.68
     you can actually put just one arm up
},
{
    439.68,442.08
     and lean into the door
},
{
    442.08,444.08
     and that would actually put a stretch
},
{
    444.08,447.04
     and you're actually going into external rotation a little bit.
},
{
    447.04,448.2
     You can use a corner.
},
{
    448.2,450.2
     Brad, do you wanna show it on the corner?
},
{
    451.52,452.92
     So yeah, there, yeah.
},
{
    452.92,455.84
     And no, you can go on both, I'm saying it's both.
},
{
    455.84,458.48
     Yeah, now you can lean in and see how he's stretching
},
{
    458.48,461.24
     the chest, but he's also stretching the arms
},
{
    461.24,462.72
     into external rotation a little bit.
},
{
    462.72,465.16
     He can even move the arms out while he's doing that.
},
{
    465.16,468.12
     Well, that helps right there from here to here.
},
{
    468.12,469.88
     Yeah, there you go.
},
{
    469.88,471.84
     Don't get too aggressive with this.
},
{
    471.84,473.52
     That can be pretty aggressive.
},
{
    473.52,474.36
     If you've never done it,
},
{
    474.36,475.88
     just take it gentle the first few times.
},
{
    475.88,477.84
     Exactly, if you've never done it before,
},
{
    477.84,479.28
     that's the key, isn't it Brad?
},
{
    479.28,482.32
     So why don't you show, now with step three,
},
{
    482.32,484.36
     is we gotta start strengthening those muscles
},
{
    484.36,486.68
     that are gonna hold it back and keep it back. Why don't you show, now with step three, is we gotta start strengthening those muscles that are gonna hold it back and keep it back.
},
{
    486.68,488.52
     Why don't you show what that band, Brad?
},
{
    488.52,492.96
     And then I'll show with one of the bands over here.
},
{
    492.96,494.96
     So the stretching is very important.
},
{
    494.96,497.36
     Those two steps, do those first.
},
{
    497.36,500.76
     Now once you get loosened up, then do the strengthening.
},
{
    500.76,504.16
     This is just a typical tube stretch band.
},
{
    504.16,507.02
     The handles are removed, which you don't need in this case.
},
{
    507.02,508.24
     You can go single.
},
{
    508.24,509.8
     You can use a loop.
},
{
    509.8,511.44
     You could, you know, there's a lot of different things
},
{
    511.44,512.44
     you could use for this.
},
{
    512.44,514.88
     I had a patient, she used a rubber snubber
},
{
    514.88,517.28
     for holding sound stuff in the car.
},
{
    517.28,518.12
     A rubber what?
},
{
    518.12,518.96
     Rubber snubber, you know,
},
{
    518.96,520.76
     it's got the hooks for holding down stuff in your car.
},
{
    520.76,521.96
     Rubber snubber?
},
{
    521.96,523.4
     No, Bob's so out of the loop.
},
{
    523.4,527.04
     You know, they got hooks for holding down things on the back of You remember, snubber? Oh, Bob's so out of the loop. Yeah. They got hooked for holding down things
},
{
    527.04,529.0
     on the back of your car, so like your-
},
{
    529.0,529.98
     Bunchy cord.
},
{
    529.98,532.64
     Right, so who calls it a rubber snubber?
},
{
    532.64,535.4
     Is it like, is that from the 20s or something?
},
{
    535.4,537.72
     Bob, you're out of the loop, snubber rubber.
},
{
    537.72,538.56
     Okay, here we go.
},
{
    538.56,539.4
     I don't remember back in the 20s.
},
{
    539.4,541.72
     So there we go, so we're gonna do this.
},
{
    541.72,545.66
     Yep, so he's externally rotating the shoulders,
},
{
    545.66,548.54
     but he's also extending back a little bit.
},
{
    548.54,549.86
     So he's tightening the muscles
},
{
    549.86,552.12
     between the shoulder blades a little bit too.
},
{
    552.12,553.98
     And you can see that how his shoulders,
},
{
    553.98,556.3
     his shirt is wrinkling up there,
},
{
    556.3,558.28
     and the whites are coming together.
},
{
    558.28,561.74
     So you're catching both strengthening aspects
},
{
    561.74,563.78
     at the same time, works really well.
},
{
    563.78,568.12
     And we can go to this and do the,
},
{
    568.12,569.76
     like the W we call it.
},
{
    569.76,572.68
     Just don't let it get you in the face.
},
{
    572.68,574.4
     So a better option for that Brad,
},
{
    574.4,576.4
     is if you wanna come over here, Liz.
},
{
    576.4,577.24
     Exactly.
},
{
    577.24,578.4
     Use our wall anchors.
},
{
    578.4,580.52
     If you haven't for other reasons anyway,
},
{
    581.6,583.4
     you can go ahead and hook it up at the top one.
},
{
    583.4,585.26
     You can hook it up to the middle one,
},
{
    585.26,587.28
     but you can go ahead and I'm gonna go ahead.
},
{
    587.28,589.38
     And this is actually the one I do, Brad.
},
{
    589.38,591.84
     I extend and then I externally rotate.
},
{
    591.84,592.88
     So he's getting this.
},
{
    592.88,595.52
     Extend, I externally rotate.
},
{
    595.52,596.96
     Extend, externally rotate.
},
{
    596.96,599.4
     And I do like 50 of these in a row.
},
{
    599.4,601.6
     Yeah, cause it's a toning muscle.
},
{
    601.6,603.32
     You know, it's a postural muscle.
},
{
    603.32,605.24
     You wanna work on-
},
{
    605.24,606.08
     High reps.
},
{
    606.08,606.96
     Yeah, high reps.
},
{
    606.96,609.6
     And what's nice about the wall anchors
},
{
    609.6,611.44
     is that you can just pop it off,
},
{
    611.44,613.4
     you can put it at a different level,
},
{
    613.4,615.72
     and you can do chest or anything else like that
},
{
    615.72,616.56
     at the same time.
},
{
    616.56,618.24
     I gotta put in a little plug for them, right?
},
{
    618.24,619.24
     Yeah, you should Bob.
},
{
    619.24,620.08
     But do them the other way
},
{
    620.08,623.12
     because I think it's important to do them at this level
},
{
    623.12,624.84
     as well, because you're working,
},
{
    624.84,626.58
     you're working the middle traps
},
{
    626.58,629.34
     versus the lower traps, which lower traps are.
},
{
    629.34,631.22
     I'm gonna do it this way, like this and like this.
},
{
    631.22,632.06
     Yeah, there you go.
},
{
    632.06,634.38
     You can have, got a good view of that, don't you Liz?
},
{
    634.38,637.54
     Yep, we wanna make sure that, there you go.
},
{
    637.54,639.62
     Now, let's say you're out there and you're going,
},
{
    639.62,641.38
     I don't wanna spend any money right now.
},
{
    641.38,642.78
     I understand that.
},
{
    642.78,644.98
     Just grab a pillow.
},
{
    644.98,647.64
     Oh yes. Lie on the pillow,
},
{
    647.64,650.0
     and you're gonna go down like this,
},
{
    650.0,651.48
     you're gonna bring your arms up,
},
{
    651.48,653.56
     and you're gonna externally rotate.
},
{
    653.56,656.32
     Arms back, externally rotate.
},
{
    656.32,658.6
     Arms back, externally rotate.
},
{
    658.6,661.04
     Now, for those of you who are just starting this,
},
{
    661.04,663.48
     this will be plenty enough stress for you.
},
{
    663.48,666.34
     Eventually you might take a couple soup cans.
},
{
    667.72,669.12
     And hold on to them.
},
{
    669.12,670.24
     Just go to the soup kitchen.
},
{
    670.24,671.52
     Don't just set them on the floor.
},
{
    671.52,672.36
     Yeah.
},
{
    672.36,673.2
     Yeah.
},
{
    673.2,674.04
     Yeah.
},
{
    674.04,674.88
     Good point.
},
{
    674.88,676.32
     You're not gonna do that on your bed
},
{
    676.32,677.2
     because it's too squishy.
},
{
    677.2,678.6
     You need to go,
},
{
    678.6,681.04
     all you could possibly maybe with a couple pillows.
},
{
    681.04,681.88
     Right.
},
{
    681.88,683.44
     But on the floor, carpet floor works well.
},
{
    683.44,685.2
     But yeah, again, you could do it in the bed now
},
{
    685.2,686.44
     that you think about it.
},
{
    686.44,687.6
     Yeah.
},
{
    687.6,688.92
     Do you want to say anything else?
},
{
    688.92,690.64
     I want to say a lot of things, Bob,
},
{
    690.64,691.96
     but people are getting bored.
},
{
    691.96,693.76
     Remember Brad and I are not just pretty.
},
{
    693.76,696.32
     Except for, no, wait, what?
},
{
    696.32,697.56
     We're not just pretty.
},
{
    697.56,701.0
     Yeah, we're not pretty except we're pretty ugly.
},
{
    701.0,702.24
     We're pretty ugly, Bob.
},
{
    702.24,704.36
     I'm supposed to say we're pretty handy.
},
{
    704.36,705.2
     Why, Bob?
},
{
    705.2,707.2
     God, what's going on with my mind?
},
{
    707.2,709.08
     It's the aging process.
},
{
    709.08,710.72
     I can't take it anymore.
},
{
    710.72,None
     All right, thanks for watching, everybody. you
},
