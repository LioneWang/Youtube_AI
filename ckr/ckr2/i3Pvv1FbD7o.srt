    63.92,67.06
     sleep-evasion mattress, fantastic mattress.
},
{
    67.06,69.48
     This is just a little sample of it.
},
{
    69.48,71.76
     You can see it's got the individual mattresses.
},
{
    71.76,74.92
     It's got the air channels, very comfortable.
},
{
    74.92,78.08
     Brad and I both have one of these and we find,
},
{
    78.08,81.28
     it's just, it's a world of difference between this
},
{
    81.28,83.68
     and when I sleep in the other bed that we have in our cabin.
},
{
    83.68,85.2
     Yeah, well I'm telling you Bob,
},
{
    85.2,86.72
     I didn't want to get out of bed this morning,
},
{
    86.72,88.24
     it was just fun delaying it.
},
{
    88.24,89.36
     All right, I'll get rid of this
},
{
    89.36,91.12
     and you can show the pillow real quick.
},
{
    91.12,93.48
     Yeah, yeah, it comes with a pillow too.
},
{
    93.48,96.44
     And the pillow also has a spat,
},
{
    96.44,97.72
     they have springs inside this pillow.
},
{
    97.72,98.56
     I don't know where I'm going here.
},
{
    98.56,100.36
     Oh Bob, you look like a lost puppy.
},
{
    100.36,101.36
     Yeah, there we go.
},
{
    101.36,103.16
     Anyways, these are really nice pillows,
},
{
    103.16,104.3
     we got a cross section here,
},
{
    104.3,105.9
     but we got to get on with this neck pain.
},
{
    105.9,107.74
     Yeah, we gotta get going here.
},
{
    107.74,108.98
     We gotta go to work.
},
{
    108.98,109.82
     Say no more.
},
{
    109.82,110.74
     Okay, Bob.
},
{
    112.98,115.42
     First, you want to address posture, right?
},
{
    115.42,118.1
     Well, I want to talk a little bit about the pinched nerve.
},
{
    118.1,120.94
     Why are we addressing posture when we got a pinched nerve?
},
{
    120.94,122.22
     So why don't you show them
},
{
    122.22,124.62
     where the nerves come out in the neck on my neck?
},
{
    124.62,127.08
     The nerves, you know, you got the cervical spine here
},
{
    127.08,129.52
     and the nerves come out at an each level.
},
{
    129.52,131.92
     They come out and they actually come down
},
{
    131.92,135.36
     and into the arm giving innervation to the arm
},
{
    135.36,139.76
     as far as sensation and movement, muscle movement.
},
{
    139.76,142.8
     So if you get a pinching actually in the neck
},
{
    142.8,144.6
     or anywhere along the line,
},
{
    144.6,146.46
     it can cause pain down the arm,
},
{
    146.46,148.3
     all the way down the arm into the hand.
},
{
    148.3,149.42
     And weakness.
},
{
    149.42,152.62
     Right, as well as in that shoulder too.
},
{
    152.62,156.66
     Typically the pinched nerve we find is in the neck.
},
{
    156.66,160.62
     It can be along a line, but majority is in the neck.
},
{
    160.62,163.94
     So in order to keep that nerve from being pinched,
},
{
    163.94,167.48
     we find that poor posture, head forward posture,
},
{
    167.48,171.08
     can cause problems where the nerve comes out the framing
},
{
    171.08,174.58
     in the spine itself causing that pinching.
},
{
    174.58,178.84
     So if we just change our posture, it's a critical step.
},
{
    178.84,179.68
     You have to do this.
},
{
    179.68,182.72
     It is, because if you try the exercises,
},
{
    182.72,184.88
     the other exercises we're gonna show you
},
{
    184.88,187.14
     to help try to decrease the pain,
},
{
    187.14,188.96
     but you don't correct your posture,
},
{
    188.96,191.04
     it's not gonna go away, it won't stay away.
},
{
    191.04,192.64
     It's gonna come right back again.
},
{
    192.64,195.24
     So you gotta correct posture first.
},
{
    195.24,196.28
     So here we go.
},
{
    196.28,198.0
     The first one, now these,
},
{
    198.0,199.8
     we talk about these a lot over the years,
},
{
    199.8,201.84
     but you gotta stick with the basics.
},
{
    201.84,203.84
     It's the fundamentals.
},
{
    203.84,205.16
     Foundation fundamentals.
},
{
    205.16,207.76
     So we're gonna do scapular retraction.
},
{
    207.76,211.06
     Or you can do these in a seated or standing position.
},
{
    211.06,213.52
     I'll show how my shoulder blades
},
{
    213.52,215.64
     are basically squeezing together.
},
{
    215.64,218.8
     Or if you wanna think about them going downward
},
{
    218.8,219.92
     into my pockets.
},
{
    219.92,221.8
     So this one goes down in this pocket,
},
{
    221.8,222.8
     this one goes down there.
},
{
    222.8,225.04
     That gets those lower traps working,
},
{
    225.04,228.12
     and the middle traps all together for good posture.
},
{
    228.12,229.92
     Do five to 10 of these.
},
{
    229.92,232.36
     What's nice about these, you can do these anywhere.
},
{
    232.36,233.64
     Oh, right.
},
{
    233.64,235.32
     Well, you can't do them driving in the car.
},
{
    235.32,237.28
     Yeah, I suppose it'd be a little difficult.
},
{
    237.28,239.84
     Well, as long as you only go to the steering wheel,
},
{
    239.84,240.68
     you might be able to swim.
},
{
    240.68,241.96
     I even do them in church.
},
{
    241.96,242.96
     Well, why not?
},
{
    242.96,245.72
     Get the whole congregation doing it.
},
{
    245.72,250.72
     And then we go to chin tucks, chin going in like this.
},
{
    251.24,255.8
     So we're not tucking down, it's in and back,
},
{
    255.8,257.04
     in and back this way.
},
{
    257.04,260.76
     Like you're bringing your chin right to your Adam's apple.
},
{
    260.76,262.32
     Now this one's great for posture.
},
{
    262.32,265.98
     And this is also actually the first exercise
},
{
    265.98,269.24
     that we start for treating the pinched nerve too.
},
{
    269.24,270.08
     Right.
},
{
    270.08,272.58
     So, yeah, when you're doing this,
},
{
    272.58,274.32
     well, we don't need to get into the framing,
},
{
    274.32,276.16
     but if there's an opening gap, the framing,
},
{
    276.16,279.3
     which can take that pinched nerve and relieve it.
},
{
    279.3,281.26
     Now this is one you can do in church.
},
{
    281.26,282.52
     You can do this in church.
},
{
    282.52,283.88
     You can do this in your car too.
},
{
    283.88,285.44
     Well, yeah, I've done it in my car.
},
{
    285.44,288.72
     Stoplight people look at you funny, but it's okay.
},
{
    288.72,289.88
     Everyone will be doing it.
},
{
    289.88,291.24
     It's not because he's doing chin tucks.
},
{
    291.24,292.08
     Okay, go ahead.
},
{
    292.08,293.88
     Now, this one you need to do in a chair.
},
{
    293.88,297.12
     Particularly if you're at work or at home,
},
{
    297.12,298.84
     you take a ball like this,
},
{
    298.84,301.2
     and if it's a little soft, it works a little bit better.
},
{
    301.2,304.0
     You don't want a hard ball that's blown up
},
{
    304.0,305.2
     with a lot of pressure.
},
{
    305.2,307.2
     And you're gonna put that behind your back,
},
{
    307.2,308.48
     like I'm showing here.
},
{
    309.36,312.8
     And the W exercise that we showed before
},
{
    312.8,314.48
     is basically the same technique,
},
{
    314.48,316.36
     but we're gonna relax into the ball
},
{
    316.36,319.04
     and you can adjust the ball up or down.
},
{
    319.04,321.32
     And you'll know because it feels better
},
{
    321.32,323.96
     in a certain position in here in the right spot.
},
{
    323.96,326.18
     So right there, I need to go up a little bit.
},
{
    326.18,327.4
     I can just feel it.
},
{
    327.4,328.46
     There we go.
},
{
    328.46,330.46
     And stretch back.
},
{
    330.46,331.62
     We can do this.
},
{
    331.62,333.9
     You can do Bob's Alulia stretch.
},
{
    333.9,336.22
     Either way, you're gonna get the shoulders
},
{
    336.22,338.26
     that come back with a chin tuck.
},
{
    338.26,339.92
     And you can even let your head go back
},
{
    339.92,341.82
     and get the full extension.
},
{
    341.82,343.34
     All should be pain free.
},
{
    343.34,344.18
     Right.
},
{
    344.18,346.3
     And this is a wonderful stretch.
},
{
    346.3,347.2
     It seriously is.
},
{
    347.2,349.5
     It's great for the neck and upper back.
},
{
    349.5,350.34
     Oh yeah.
},
{
    350.34,351.98
     It's a fantastic stretch.
},
{
    351.98,353.9
     I highly recommend it for most people.
},
{
    353.9,356.62
     And all of these are gonna do five to 10 repetitions.
},
{
    356.62,359.22
     And you know, every one to two hours throughout the day,
},
{
    359.22,362.54
     as long as you can fit that in your schedule.
},
{
    362.54,365.84
     The next one, this is where you go up against the wall.
},
{
    365.84,368.28
     All right, follow Brad over to the wall.
},
{
    368.28,371.88
     We use the wall, and the wall's gonna show you good posture.
},
{
    371.88,374.92
     You take your belt line or your butt area,
},
{
    374.92,377.32
     that goes against the wall, shoulders against the wall,
},
{
    377.32,381.04
     bring your shoulders back, the back of your head
},
{
    381.04,382.76
     with a slight chin tuck.
},
{
    382.76,384.28
     Now I've got good posture.
},
{
    384.28,386.24
     The wall is my guide.
},
{
    386.24,389.24
     And I'm gonna bring my arms up like this
},
{
    389.24,392.4
     and slide my arms up like this.
},
{
    392.4,394.6
     Now I personally have a kind of a tough time
},
{
    394.6,396.32
     getting my elbows to the wall,
},
{
    396.32,397.76
     but it's getting better over time.
},
{
    397.76,399.04
     You know, a few years ago,
},
{
    399.04,402.46
     this was not possible for me, so I'm improving.
},
{
    402.46,405.2
     And this works to proper muscles for posture
},
{
    405.2,408.86
     and the wall guides you that you are in good posture.
},
{
    408.86,410.24
     Whoa, and I'm getting tired.
},
{
    410.24,412.74
     You can feel those posture muscles working aggressively.
},
{
    412.74,414.24
     You're gonna do that for a minute or two
},
{
    414.24,415.58
     if you can go that long before you get tired.
},
{
    415.58,417.36
     So they're called wall angels.
},
{
    417.36,418.2
     Yes.
},
{
    418.2,421.58
     And you know, if you can picture Brad as an angel.
},
{
    421.58,422.42
     There you go.
},
{
    422.42,423.26
     Oh yeah.
},
{
    423.26,424.1
     All right.
},
{
    424.1,425.52
     Yeah, that's a far cry.
},
{
    425.52,427.92
     Now, the other thing we do have,
},
{
    427.92,429.88
     if you wanna go the next step up,
},
{
    429.88,432.68
     this is actually a postural exercise.
},
{
    432.68,433.88
     It's great for the shoulders,
},
{
    433.88,435.28
     as well as the low back,
},
{
    435.28,438.24
     and it's our hanging handles.
},
{
    438.24,440.56
     And you do that against the wall too.
},
{
    440.56,442.76
     And I'm just gonna hang out here.
},
{
    442.76,445.52
     Ha, ha, no, I'm pun intended.
},
{
    445.52,447.36
     You know, you'll do this for anywhere
},
{
    447.36,449.6
     from 10 to 30 seconds, depending on how long you can hang.
},
{
    449.6,451.12
     And again, it should be pain free
},
{
    451.12,453.8
     if this bothers your neck, pinched nerve neck.
},
{
    453.8,456.8
     You wouldn't be doing this, but if it feels good, it's good.
},
{
    456.8,457.64
     Right.
},
{
    457.64,461.52
     That's, you know, and this basically has our,
},
{
    461.52,462.88
     it comes with our wall anchor,
},
{
    462.88,464.44
     and then it comes with a clip
},
{
    464.44,467.84
     that you could just clip on there and you have the handles.
},
{
    467.84,470.16
     And these things are rated for how many pounds, Brad?
},
{
    470.16,471.68
     250 each.
},
{
    471.68,472.88
     250 each.
},
{
    472.88,474.84
     No, I think it's 275 each.
},
{
    474.84,475.68
     It might be.
},
{
    475.68,477.84
     Yeah, if you're close to 500 pounds,
},
{
    477.84,478.68
     you better not hang on there.
},
{
    478.68,480.04
     Hold off, yeah.
},
{
    480.04,481.76
     So either way, I think you're covered.
},
{
    481.76,484.76
     Now we're gonna look at symptoms down the arm next.
},
{
    484.76,488.0
     And it's not uncommon for a pinched nerve in the low neck
},
{
    488.0,491.88
     to send numbness, tingling, burning sensations,
},
{
    491.88,493.2
     all the way down into the fingers.
},
{
    493.2,494.04
     And weakness even.
},
{
    494.04,495.48
     Yep, and weakness.
},
{
    495.48,497.0
     And if you are having weakness,
},
{
    497.0,498.64
     your grip is obviously weak,
},
{
    498.64,500.3
     you have a hard time opening the door.
},
{
    500.3,501.64
     You probably better go see a doctor.
},
{
    501.64,502.8
     Yeah, you better see a doctor
},
{
    502.8,505.04
     if you get symptoms in the hand, I would say.
},
{
    505.04,507.08
     That's pretty extreme.
},
{
    507.08,509.76
     But what we can do, and we've had a lot of success
},
{
    509.76,514.76
     with this exercise, is in a chair with a back rest,
},
{
    515.1,517.24
     you put your bottom all the way back in.
},
{
    517.24,518.16
     Very good posture.
},
{
    518.16,519.52
     Very good posture.
},
{
    519.52,521.12
     We've just worked on posture,
},
{
    521.12,522.92
     so you got that in your head,
},
{
    522.92,524.28
     and we're gonna do some chin tucks,
},
{
    524.28,526.0
     and then we're gonna actually bring our head back.
},
{
    526.0,529.28
     Now, if you do this, and it starts to become uncomfortable
},
{
    529.28,532.36
     and painful, and it makes symptoms down the arm worse,
},
{
    532.36,535.48
     it's pretty clear you got a pinched nerve in your neck.
},
{
    535.48,537.76
     So, if you take a towel roll,
},
{
    537.76,540.64
     now the red tape is just something to hold the towel together.
},
{
    540.64,541.84
     You can use rubber bands,
},
{
    541.84,543.88
     you don't even have to hold it together,
},
{
    543.88,545.6
     as long as you keep with your hands. Low on the neck, back up use rubber bands. You don't even have to hold it together as long as you keep with your hands.
},
{
    545.6,549.24
     Low on the neck, back up against the chair.
},
{
    549.24,552.28
     Now I've got an office chair that works good for me.
},
{
    552.28,555.44
     Don't get the kind that lets you go back real far.
},
{
    555.44,557.36
     You want a good support.
},
{
    557.36,559.6
     Right, so you feel confident in it.
},
{
    559.6,563.36
     And I'm gonna do my chin tuck and then gently go back.
},
{
    563.36,564.8
     And with this support here,
},
{
    564.8,568.76
     oftentimes makes that pain much more comfortable. And then then gently go back. And with this support here, oftentimes makes that pain much more comfortable.
},
{
    568.76,569.64
     And then you can go back.
},
{
    569.64,571.1
     And then when you start to feel pain,
},
{
    571.1,573.52
     you come forward again and back.
},
{
    573.52,575.9
     So you're not gonna hang out back there for 30 seconds
},
{
    575.9,576.74
     or anything like that.
},
{
    576.74,580.06
     It's just to back until you feel the discomfort
},
{
    580.06,582.9
     then come forward, relax.
},
{
    582.9,585.52
     If you have the, let's say this is the painful arm,
},
{
    585.52,587.64
     sometimes I'll let that one relax
},
{
    587.64,589.88
     and just grab with one arm.
},
{
    589.88,592.6
     And what you're looking for here,
},
{
    592.6,595.8
     ideally is we're looking for centralization of the symptoms.
},
{
    595.8,597.2
     What does that mean?
},
{
    597.2,600.3
     If, let's say you're getting pain all the way down the arm,
},
{
    600.3,601.76
     into the hand even.
},
{
    601.76,604.32
     What you're looking for first is that it's gonna get better
},
{
    604.32,607.48
     in the hand or get better in the hand even. What you're looking for first is that it's gonna get better in the hand or get better in the forearm first.
},
{
    607.48,610.4
     So you want these symptoms to go away first
},
{
    610.4,612.24
     and it might even get a little more intense here,
},
{
    612.24,614.0
     but it's going away here, that's great.
},
{
    614.0,615.48
     That's a very good sign.
},
{
    616.32,620.0
     Even if you have less tingling there, that's a good sign.
},
{
    620.0,622.2
     Anything that improves down here.
},
{
    622.2,624.76
     And eventually it'll improve here,
},
{
    624.76,626.76
     eventually you'll feel it just into here,
},
{
    626.76,629.32
     and then eventually you'll feel it just in the neck.
},
{
    629.32,631.04
     That's the progression you wanna feel.
},
{
    631.04,632.68
     That's centralization.
},
{
    632.68,635.02
     That means it's going the right way.
},
{
    635.02,636.52
     Why don't you show another option?
},
{
    636.52,638.6
     Sometimes you get that pinching,
},
{
    638.6,640.64
     and instead of using this,
},
{
    640.64,643.16
     it actually improves from going to the side.
},
{
    643.16,644.88
     Right, sometimes for some people,
},
{
    644.88,646.7
     this is for me and this was,
},
{
    646.7,648.26
     I told this story before,
},
{
    648.26,650.74
     he was such a great example, he was a dentist
},
{
    650.74,653.86
     and he was getting pain down his arm,
},
{
    653.86,655.7
     very serious to the point
},
{
    655.7,657.26
     where he wasn't gonna be able to practice.
},
{
    657.26,658.1
     Sure.
},
{
    658.1,659.3
     And so what we had him do,
},
{
    659.3,661.66
     he tried those, it didn't really help.
},
{
    661.66,662.94
     So what we did instead,
},
{
    662.94,664.7
     it pained with down the right arm,
},
{
    664.7,669.12
     so we had him do the chin tuck and then side bend to the side.
},
{
    669.12,671.52
     And he would do these repeatedly.
},
{
    671.52,673.56
     And he would do these like, you know,
},
{
    673.56,677.18
     10 times every hour, a set of 10.
},
{
    677.18,680.0
     And it was a miraculous, Brad.
},
{
    680.0,680.84
     I mean-
},
{
    680.84,681.8
     As long as arm pain and symptoms-
},
{
    681.8,683.48
     Yeah, within two days.
},
{
    683.48,684.32
     Oh.
},
{
    684.32,686.08
     It was very much improved. And within. Oh, it was very much improved.
},
{
    686.08,687.8
     And within a week it was pretty much gone.
},
{
    687.8,688.64
     Sure.
},
{
    688.64,689.48
     So, you can't.
},
{
    689.48,691.4
     No, it doesn't always go that way, unfortunately,
},
{
    691.4,694.8
     but you know, you like these small miracle wins.
},
{
    694.8,695.64
     Yes.
},
{
    695.64,697.44
     That show up in the clinic once in a while, so.
},
{
    697.44,698.92
     All right.
},
{
    698.92,699.76
     Brad.
},
{
    699.76,701.56
     Last but not least, we didn't do anything on the floor yet.
},
{
    701.56,704.7
     But if you do have a six inch form roller.
},
{
    706.86,708.92
     Just another great postural one to do.
},
{
    708.92,710.44
     Yeah.
},
{
    710.44,711.88
     And you're gonna roll,
},
{
    711.88,714.38
     and typically kind of up towards the neck.
},
{
    715.5,717.76
     And you can do the W's here as well,
},
{
    717.76,719.68
     hand back and here with some chin tuck,
},
{
    719.68,721.84
     so all the same basic movements.
},
{
    721.84,722.96
     Again, pain free.
},
{
    722.96,724.24
     Yep.
},
{
    724.24,727.64
     And then one thing, and I was just doing this with my wife
},
{
    727.64,730.48
     cause she was having some issues with pain down her arm
},
{
    730.48,732.36
     and you can put the roll this way.
},
{
    732.36,735.04
     Now, if you have a foam roller, it's a softer one,
},
{
    735.04,737.52
     like this blue one, they're more comfortable to do this.
},
{
    737.52,741.04
     This is all you do, you just hang out here for 15, 30 seconds
},
{
    741.04,742.52
     and you can just hang out.
},
{
    742.52,744.88
     Now, I've done this after exercise.
},
{
    744.88,747.28
     I'll just hang out here for three to five minutes
},
{
    747.28,750.04
     and just relax and close my eyes and go.
},
{
    750.04,752.12
     But if you gotta have the softer roller,
},
{
    752.12,754.0
     otherwise it's a little uncomfortable.
},
{
    754.0,756.04
     The black ones are the hard density.
},
{
    756.04,758.0
     The colored ones are typically the softer ones.
},
{
    758.0,760.44
     It's kind of a lazy man's way to posture there.
},
{
    760.44,762.6
     You just lay down there and let it stretch,
},
{
    762.6,763.92
     let gravity do its thing.
},
{
    763.92,767.28
     I'm telling you, Bob, you give someone the lazy person
},
{
    767.28,769.64
     how to do a task and it'll be the easiest way.
},
{
    769.64,771.84
     That's right, they'll figure out the best way to do it.
},
{
    771.84,772.68
     That's right.
},
{
    772.68,774.76
     All right, thanks everybody.
},
{
    774.76,775.96
     Enjoy the day.
},
{
    775.96,None
     Thanks everybody for watching. you
},
