     In my most recent video request,
},
{
    1.96,6.96
     somebody was asking me, how can I stop clenching my jaw?
},
{
    8.9,11.26
     Anybody who clenches their jaw,
},
{
    11.26,15.6
     that can be, it can complicate TMJ problems.
},
{
    15.6,17.78
     So if you got jaw, TMJ, clicking and things like that,
},
{
    17.78,19.26
     it can complicate it, make it worse
},
{
    19.26,21.76
     or make it more challenging to recover.
},
{
    21.76,24.62
     People with tension headaches, jaw clenching,
},
{
    24.62,25.96
     not only do you use the
},
{
    25.96,28.1
     muscles in here, but these muscles in
},
{
    28.1,30.04
     here are always activated so it can
},
{
    30.04,31.92
     exacerbate tension headaches and then
},
{
    31.92,33.2
     the same thing for neck pain, chronic
},
{
    33.2,34.64
     neck pain, neck tension and things like
},
{
    34.64,37.12
     that, jaw clenching can aggravate that.
},
{
    37.12,39.32
     So in this video I am going to go over
},
{
    39.32,41.36
     three strategies that I've found to be
},
{
    41.36,44.2
     very beneficial to help people not
},
{
    44.2,45.44
     clench their jaw or have
},
{
    45.44,52.82
     that bruxism.
},
{
    52.82,58.26
     So strategy number one that I want to talk about, when somebody clenches their jaw,
},
{
    58.26,62.7
     mainly they're using muscles right here, they're called masseter muscles.
},
{
    62.7,68.9
     If you clench your jaw and put your fingers right here, you'll feel it get tight. Put your finger up here, they're
},
{
    68.9,73.26
     called temporalis muscles. Those are tight. What we want to do is try to
},
{
    73.26,79.38
     neurologically get those muscles to not fire quite so much and use some other
},
{
    79.38,83.9
     muscles called digastric muscles and they're down in through here. So there's a
},
{
    83.9,87.56
     couple of strategies that we have to do that.
},
{
    87.56,92.96
     First, let's talk about just what's the natural resting position of the jaw.
},
{
    92.96,95.94
     The lips should be closed.
},
{
    95.94,99.06
     Your teeth should be slightly apart.
},
{
    99.06,100.6
     Don't let your teeth touch.
},
{
    100.6,107.26
     And the tongue should just be resting in the roof of the mouth. That's the natural resting jaw position.
},
{
    107.26,109.94
     So one strategy could be tune in,
},
{
    109.94,111.84
     check in every once in a while.
},
{
    111.84,113.16
     Are you in that position?
},
{
    113.16,116.26
     Just be conscious of, oh shoot, try to break that habit.
},
{
    116.26,118.54
     So just check in with yourself and do it.
},
{
    118.54,122.82
     Now here's an added trick, an added little feature
},
{
    122.82,124.38
     that you can do.
},
{
    124.38,125.8
     So you take the tip of your
},
{
    125.8,130.88
     tongue and you're going to curl it up so that the tip of the tongue thrusts up
},
{
    130.88,135.2
     into the roof of your mouth, that hard bony structure right there in the roof
},
{
    135.2,140.76
     of your mouth. You do that. Feel these muscles on the under surface of your jaw
},
{
    140.76,155.36
     right here and when you thrust that tongue up you should feel this tighten up. So some people it is beneficial just to do some exercises
},
{
    155.36,160.16
     like that do three sets of ten you could probably get away with just doing a set
},
{
    160.16,165.66
     or two sets of five to ten but But the idea is just break the pattern
},
{
    165.66,167.96
     of this quenching all the time
},
{
    167.96,170.54
     and try to get the opposite muscles engaged.
},
{
    170.54,171.96
     You're gonna get the nervous system
},
{
    171.96,174.62
     to kind of unwind that tension pattern.
},
{
    174.62,175.96
     Use some other muscles.
},
{
    175.96,177.4
     Use the opposite muscles
},
{
    177.4,180.16
     or they're called the antagonistic muscles.
},
{
    180.16,182.8
     You can go another step further.
},
{
    182.8,184.56
     And I should also mention,
},
{
    184.56,188.16
     you wanna do all of these with fairly good neck posture.
},
{
    188.16,189.6
     Don't do them out here.
},
{
    189.6,191.6
     So kind of be up tall through your mid-back.
},
{
    191.6,194.92
     You don't have to over exaggerate it necessarily.
},
{
    194.92,200.58
     But if you have bad neck posture, I've talked about in other videos, go ahead and over exaggerate
},
{
    200.58,203.8
     good neck posture for about five seconds and then come out of it.
},
{
    203.8,208.84
     You want to be relaxed. And then the next thing that you could do is take the tip of the tongue
},
{
    208.84,212.72
     just like you did before, put it in the roof of the mouth and this time you're not going
},
{
    212.72,216.0
     to thrust it so much. You're just going to leave it in contact there but you're going
},
{
    216.0,227.92
     to open your jaw. And keep that tip of the tongue in place. That's going to allow you to use more of these muscles in here.
},
{
    227.92,232.44
     Again, neurologically, you're going to use these muscles less and you're going to try
},
{
    232.44,234.4
     to break that pattern or that cycle.
},
{
    234.4,240.16
     And over time, you checking in periodically, doing the proper rest position of the jaw,
},
{
    240.16,242.92
     meaning don't let your teeth touch each other.
},
{
    242.92,249.52
     And if you consistently do some of these types of exercises, you can slowly unwind that pattern.
},
{
    250.8,255.44
     Also, additionally, give yourself little massages in here. These muscles are clenching all the time.
},
{
    256.32,261.2
     Try to relax them. You know, self little massages, go to a massage therapist, go to a chiropractor
},
{
    261.2,266.6
     that does myofascial release, anything like that. But work the tense spots out,
},
{
    266.6,268.32
     all the little trigger points that you're gonna have
},
{
    268.32,270.68
     through all of those muscles and through there.
},
{
    271.88,274.32
     A lot of times, Bruxism is linked
},
{
    274.32,277.64
     to some form of anxiety, stress.
},
{
    277.64,280.08
     So having good strategies.
},
{
    280.08,283.52
     I am not a therapist and I'm not here to try
},
{
    283.52,286.28
     to discuss all of the options there.
},
{
    286.28,290.22
     But things like, sometimes things as simple as journaling, you know, just getting your
},
{
    290.22,294.16
     thoughts out, having a good action strategy, meaning, purpose in your life, there's a whole
},
{
    294.16,298.3
     world, but those are things to look into.
},
{
    298.3,303.56
     And then lastly, something that I'm extremely interested in to control the stress and anxiety
},
{
    303.56,305.2
     that works well for myself or
},
{
    305.2,309.28
     breathing techniques. There is an entire world of breathing techniques but I'll
},
{
    309.28,313.0
     point you in the direction of a couple that work well. One is called Boutique
},
{
    313.0,320.8
     breathing method and the idea is to practice breath holds. What they'll do
},
{
    320.8,329.4
     is just some nice gentle breathing. They don't do a lot of the, you know, they say that that winds up the stress response.
},
{
    329.4,332.46
     Some people will argue if you wind up the stress response enough that you're going to
},
{
    332.46,337.06
     kind of trip a circuit in a way and then you'll calm down after that.
},
{
    337.06,340.46
     But there are a lot of breathing techniques that you could practice.
},
{
    340.46,351.16
     And again, butteco is one of those breathing techniques where you calm your breathing meditation could be one just relax tune in mindfulness
},
{
    351.16,355.48
     diaphragmatic breathing and then practice some breath holds and hold the
},
{
    355.48,361.76
     breath for 30 seconds even up to 60 seconds at a time and there are proven
},
{
    361.76,365.52
     benefits to stress reduction through these types of breathing techniques
},
{
    365.52,367.12
     and through meditation.
},
{
    367.12,369.44
     So there's three strategies for you right there.
},
{
    369.44,374.92
     If you have bruxism, if you're clenching and it's exacerbating TMJ problems, neck pain,
},
{
    374.92,378.92
     tension, headaches, there are three really good strategies to help you out.
