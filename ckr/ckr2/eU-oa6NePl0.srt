     Hi there, this is Dr. Evan Ostar with Chicago Integrative Movement Specialists.
},
{
    11.84,16.04
     Welcome to this newsletter where we're going to discuss osteoporosis and osteopenia and
},
{
    16.04,19.56
     the exercise-related component to improving those conditions.
},
{
    19.56,22.04
     In the last newsletter we talked about the nutritional component.
},
{
    22.04,23.56
     Today we're going to focus on the exercise.
},
{
    23.56,28.56
     One of the most simple and easy things to think about with osteopenia and osteoporosis
},
{
    28.56,33.96
     regarding exercise is the more weight-bearing exercise you can do and add external loads
},
{
    33.96,38.52
     to at a safer level the better they are for your bone and increasing bone density.
},
{
    38.52,44.12
     So things like walking, running, resistance training, anything that puts loads on the
},
{
    44.12,46.4
     body through the axial spine
},
{
    46.4,51.6
     from the ground reacting into the body or with external loads coming down on top of
},
{
    51.6,55.6
     the spine is perfect for building bone density.
},
{
    55.6,61.6
     However, the challenges many of our clients, many of the patients we see in our office,
},
{
    61.6,66.84
     don't have good alignment so they get joint conditions and problems and
},
{
    66.84,71.36
     degenerative joint conditions because they're not lining the bones up properly and their
},
{
    71.36,72.36
     joints up properly.
},
{
    72.36,76.76
     In fact, we had a patient who had osteopenia on one hip so she had decreased bone density
},
{
    76.76,78.36
     in one hip but not the other.
},
{
    78.36,84.36
     And what we saw is as she was doing her lunge patterns she would constantly cave in and
},
{
    84.36,85.92
     shoot her hips out to the side.
},
{
    85.92,90.08
     She was unable to stack her joints appropriately and keep herself nice and controlled.
},
{
    90.08,94.96
     So rather than go through all the exercises you can do to improve bone density, I'm going
},
{
    94.96,102.56
     to show you exactly how to line your body up so that when you do walking, jogging, resistance
},
{
    102.56,105.6
     training, your body is in the proper alignment both to save your
},
{
    105.6,108.76
     joints but also to help your bones increase their density.
},
{
    108.76,112.32
     So the first thing we're going to discuss is the alignment of our spine.
},
{
    112.32,116.48
     We want to think about somebody grabbing us from the back of the head and lifting us gently
},
{
    116.48,119.0
     towards the ceiling to make ourselves tall.
},
{
    119.0,121.52
     This is not tall, this is compressed.
},
{
    121.52,124.68
     This is tall when somebody pulls us up and our rib cage is actually down.
},
{
    124.68,129.86
     So we don't want to lift that chest up like this, keep that rib cage down, spine long.
},
{
    129.86,135.12
     We want to feel like we're tall through the pelvis, not tucking under, so not here tucking
},
{
    135.12,138.88
     under but long and level through the pelvis.
},
{
    138.88,144.12
     And we want to feel like we're stacked over top our feet, not collapse, slight arches
},
{
    144.12,145.2
     and stacked over top the feet feet, not collapse, slight arches, and stacked over top of the
},
{
    145.2,147.0
     feet all the way up.
},
{
    147.0,150.96
     So for example, during a squat pattern, I'm going to put my hand on my chest and I'll
},
{
    150.96,155.08
     tell my patients to put their hand on their abdomen like I'm doing here and then do a
},
{
    155.08,158.04
     small squat while keeping this alignment.
},
{
    158.04,159.52
     So I want to do a small squat.
},
{
    159.52,164.84
     So again, align the joints, load the joints up with a small squat pattern.
},
{
    164.84,169.52
     If your client or if you as a client or a patient has trouble with their knees and or
},
{
    169.52,175.56
     hips, there's many ways to modify this using a ball, using a smaller range of motion to
},
{
    175.56,178.28
     help improve these patterns.
},
{
    178.28,182.12
     So again, I'll do it to the side, hand on the chest, hand on the abdomen, line, stay
},
{
    182.12,186.0
     long through your spine, sit back in your hips,
},
{
    186.0,187.0
     and come back up.
},
{
    187.0,188.0
     You don't have to go very far.
},
{
    188.0,195.0
     All you're trying to do is line the joints up to and improve the control of the joints
},
{
    195.0,197.36
     in these load bearing positions.
},
{
    197.36,201.28
     Another great pattern for the upper body to start to increase the load through the shoulders,
},
{
    201.28,202.28
     through the arms, is a push-up.
},
{
    202.28,206.6
     And we can start with the wall push-up, the most simple of the patterns for the upper body.
},
{
    206.6,209.16
     Again, align yourself on the wall here,
},
{
    209.16,212.54
     align the spine, keep the rib cage down in the front,
},
{
    212.54,214.12
     put your palms just a little bit wider
},
{
    214.12,217.72
     than shoulder width apart, and go up on your tip toes.
},
{
    217.72,219.56
     And again, if you have any problems with your feet,
},
{
    219.56,221.52
     toes, just keep a flat foot then.
},
{
    221.52,225.96
     And all you're gonna do is do a a small wall pushup and push away.
},
{
    225.96,228.4
     Again, maintain that alignment.
},
{
    228.4,234.6
     Make sure that you do not lose control of your shoulder blades and or your spinal position.
},
{
    234.6,240.84
     Because again, the key to improving bone density is resistance and weight bearing activity.
},
{
    240.84,246.08
     But the key to maintaining health of your joints and your soft tissue structures is to align
},
{
    246.08,253.56
     your body properly so that you can perform the exercises that help us build bone density.
},
{
    253.56,258.56
     So align yourself, breathe right, activate your core appropriately, then put external
},
{
    258.56,264.52
     resistance whether you walk, run, and or lift weights or do resistance type training.
},
{
    264.52,267.2
