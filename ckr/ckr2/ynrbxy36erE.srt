     Perfumers can learn to distinguish individual odors in a fragrance made of hundreds of scents.

     Tea experts have been known to sniff out not just the location where a tea was from, but
},
{
    18.76,22.8
     the season of harvest and whether it was planted by a plum tree.
},
{
    22.8,27.04
     And the New York City Transit Authority once had an employee responsible only
},
{
    27.04,30.56
     for sniffing out gas leaks in the subway system.
},
{
    30.56,32.2
     Can just anyone learn to smell
},
{
    32.2,35.12
     with the sensitivity of those experts?
},
{
    35.12,38.8
     For most of us, what we smell is largely involuntary,
},
{
    38.8,40.76
     whether it's garbage behind a restaurant,
},
{
    40.76,43.8
     the shampoo of the woman leaving an elevator as you enter,
},
{
    43.8,45.5
     or a bakery's fresh-made bread.
},
{
    46.5,52.5
     With a few million olfactory receptors in our noses, we clearly don't lack the ability to smell well.
},
{
    52.5,55.5
     We just might not always pay close enough attention.
},
{
    55.5,61.5
     That's a shame, because we may be missing opportunities to make strong emotional connections.
},
{
    61.5,65.36
     Smells are powerfully linked to emotions and can awaken memories of
},
{
    65.36,70.24
     places we've long ago left and people we've loved. But fortunately it is
},
{
    70.24,75.24
     possible to train our brains to smell better. For example Helen Keller was able
},
{
    75.24,80.6
     to recognize a person's work and in her words distinguish the carpenter from the
},
{
    80.6,86.0
     ironworker, the artist from the mason or the chemist, by a simple inhale.
},
{
    86.0,91.0
     Follow these steps and you too can change the way the world smells to you.
},
{
    91.0,94.0
     First, stick your nose in it.
},
{
    94.0,99.0
     Some animals that are known to be great smellers, like dogs who can sniff out explosives
},
{
    99.0,102.0
     and pigs who can find truffles underground,
},
{
    102.0,105.08
     put their noses right at the place they want to smell.
},
{
    106.08,108.44
     Human noses, meanwhile, are casting around
},
{
    108.44,109.64
     in the middle of the air,
},
{
    109.64,112.32
     giving us an anatomical disadvantage.
},
{
    112.32,115.72
     So, bring your nose close to the world around you.
},
{
    115.72,120.04
     The ground, surfaces, objects, the food in your hand.
},
{
    120.04,122.32
     Get close to your dog, your partner,
},
{
    122.32,124.2
     the book you're reading.
},
{
    124.2,127.0
     Not only will your nose be closer to the odor source,
},
{
    127.0,131.16
     but the warmth of your breath will make odors easier to smell.
},
{
    131.16,133.92
     Second, sniff like you mean it.
},
{
    133.92,137.24
     Smelling actually happens way up near the bridge of our noses
},
{
    137.24,139.68
     in a postage stamp-sized square of tissue
},
{
    139.68,142.88
     called the olfactory epithelium.
},
{
    142.88,148.78
     When we sniff, odor molecules are sucked up into our nostrils until they hit this tissue,
},
{
    148.78,153.8
     where they can bind to our Ulfactory or scent receptors.
},
{
    153.8,157.08
     When we inhale normally, only a little air makes it there.
},
{
    157.08,163.28
     But one or two solid, sharp sniffs will ensure that more air gets to your smell receptors.
},
{
    163.28,168.12
     After just a few more sniffs, the receptors, which are best at noticing new smells, turn
},
{
    168.12,170.04
     off temporarily.
},
{
    170.04,173.52
     So you can give your nose a rest and sniff again later.
},
{
    173.52,176.88
     Finally, dwell on the smell.
},
{
    176.88,180.04
     Most smells pass by us with little attention.
},
{
    180.04,184.48
     But simply noticing what you're smelling and trying to describe it, name it, and locate
},
{
    184.48,189.32
     its source, you can expand your own vocabulary of smells.
},
{
    189.32,194.28
     When an odor molecule binds to a scent receptor, it sends an electrical signal from the sensory
},
{
    194.28,197.62
     neurons to our brain's olfactory bulbs.
},
{
    197.62,202.32
     The signal then continues to other areas of the brain, where it's integrated with taste,
},
{
    202.32,207.0
     memory, or emotional information before registering to us as a smell.
},
{
    207.0,214.0
     fMRI research shows that the extra time spent focusing on scent changes the brain of experienced smellers.
},
{
    214.0,220.0
     For them, perceiving and imagining odours becomes more automatic than for non-experts.
},
{
    220.0,228.0
     To get started yourself, take ingredients from your kitchen. Spices, vanilla or fruit, but never anything toxic.
},
{
    228.0,232.0
     Close your eyes and have someone bring them under your nose.
},
{
    232.0,235.0
     Sniff and try to name the source.
},
{
    235.0,239.0
     Over time you'll begin to appreciate nuances in familiar odors
},
{
    239.0,243.0
     and recognize characteristics of new and unusual smells.
},
{
    243.0,245.8
     The perfumer has practiced these steps enough
},
{
    245.8,247.94
     to become an artist of odor.
},
{
    247.94,250.88
     But even if you never pursue smelling to that degree,
},
{
    250.88,254.12
     the spectacular result of an unspectacular action
},
{
    254.12,257.6
     will change how you sense and experience your days.
