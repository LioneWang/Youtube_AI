{
    0.0,9.6
     So now after you went through your tests, you got your x-rays, they came back negative,
},
{
    9.6,10.6
     there's not a fracture.
},
{
    10.6,14.24
     The next thing you're going to want to do is wrap the ankle to help reduce some of the
},
{
    14.24,15.52
     swelling.
},
{
    15.52,21.44
     So you can use a wrap here and what you want to start on the balls of the feet and you
},
{
    21.44,26.16
     can wrap around and make a nice anchor two or three times around
},
{
    26.16,30.96
     with a good amount of pressure. Once you have your anchor, then you can start going at a
},
{
    30.96,39.46
     diagonal kind of making little mini X's all the way up and down the feet. Things that
},
{
    39.46,45.76
     you want to consider, you want more pressure to be down at the very end of the feet and to slowly
},
{
    45.76,51.3
     kind of let off the pressure as you're traveling up the foot.
},
{
    51.3,56.04
     So again you could leave a little space there for the ankle, maybe go back down and wrap
},
{
    56.04,59.4
     around one more time to make sure it's secure.
},
{
    59.4,66.72
     And again you're just making a diagonal X pattern all the way up.
},
{
    68.4,73.2
     And then once you're there, again you can rip and tape the A-spanage in place there
},
{
    73.2,74.44
     so it holds tight.
},
{
    74.44,76.48
     Okay, so once your foot is wrapped,
},
{
    76.48,78.56
     the next thing that you're gonna wanna do
},
{
    78.56,81.24
     as often as you can throughout the day is ice
},
{
    81.24,83.28
     and also elevate the foot.
},
{
    83.28,85.0
     So we're gonna haveie lie back here.
},
{
    85.0,92.0
     We're going to prop her foot up. And again, you ideally want it to be above the level of the heart.
},
{
    92.0,98.0
     So if Brie could lie down, that's perfect. So now gravity will be pulling all that swelling
},
{
    98.0,108.0
     and inflammation in the ankle back down the leg and back into circulation towards the heart. And the other thing you can do too is use ice while you're elevating.
},
{
    108.0,112.0
     So you usually use something thin like a pillowcase
},
{
    112.0,116.0
     in between the ice pack and the foot.
},
{
    116.0,120.0
     And again, you don't have to have any type of special ice pack. I usually just tell patients
},
{
    120.0,124.0
     to use a pack of peas or frozen vegetables. And again, you want to
},
{
    124.0,129.16
     apply ice for about 15 to 20 minutes at a time and you can do that as often as you
},
{
    129.16,133.2
     would like throughout the day in order to help reduce the swelling and improve
},
{
    133.2,137.98
     your pain and range of ocean immune. I'm Nick Birch and this is your PTFTip
},
{
    137.98,148.6
     of the week. I hope you enjoyed it.
