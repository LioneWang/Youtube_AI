     Bob and Brad, the two most famous physical therapists on the internet.
},
{
    8.0,13.2
     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.
},
{
    13.2,14.2
     Brad Heineck, physical therapist.
},
{
    14.2,16.2
     We are the most famous physical therapists on the internet.
},
{
    16.2,17.2
     In our opinion, of course, Bob.
},
{
    17.2,20.34
     Today, Brad, we're going to talk about hip pain and hip arthritis.
},
{
    20.34,22.28
     Stop pain with simple exercises.
},
{
    22.28,23.28
     Right.
},
{
    23.28,25.12
     A lot of times times simple is better.
},
{
    25.12,26.76
     You don't have to get too complex with this
},
{
    26.76,28.76
     and sometimes you may avoid surgery
},
{
    28.76,30.2
     even if you do something with exercise.
},
{
    30.2,33.16
     Exactly, if you've got nothing to lose.
},
{
    33.16,35.24
     I wanna talk about this little bit Bob
},
{
    35.24,37.68
     and this is something a lot of our people,
},
{
    37.68,39.6
     our patients as well as our viewers
},
{
    39.6,42.28
     I'm sure experienced this with hip or knee pain
},
{
    42.28,46.38
     particularly they go in, they get x-rays and the doctor
},
{
    46.38,50.14
     looks at us and says, my goodness, you've got arthritis in your joints. As a matter
},
{
    50.14,54.02
     of fact, you've got arthritis on both hips and it looks like your right hip is a lot
},
{
    54.02,60.86
     worse than your left and then the patient will say, well, but my left hip hurts more
},
{
    60.86,61.86
     than my right hip.
},
{
    61.86,65.32
     You hear this all the time. It could be hips or knees.
},
{
    65.32,66.56
     I see that all the time.
},
{
    66.56,68.2
     They'll say, in fact, they'll go in
},
{
    68.2,70.04
     for knee replacement surgery and they'll say,
},
{
    70.04,72.52
     well, actually it looks like the other one's worse.
},
{
    72.52,75.48
     But they end up doing the one that hurts the most.
},
{
    75.48,76.32
     Right.
},
{
    76.32,77.16
     Generally.
},
{
    77.16,78.76
     I get people asking, well, what should I do?
},
{
    78.76,81.4
     And so then it all boils down to this adage
},
{
    81.4,82.56
     in the medical community.
},
{
    82.56,85.84
     Do you treat the x-rays or treat the patient?
},
{
    85.84,87.16
     Because the patients say,
},
{
    87.16,89.88
     I want the painful knee operate on the X-rays,
},
{
    89.88,92.08
     might say, oh, this looks worse.
},
{
    92.08,93.84
     In therapy, we don't have this issue.
},
{
    93.84,95.88
     We always go after the painful side.
},
{
    95.88,97.2
     Absolutely.
},
{
    97.2,100.28
     And quite often, sometimes when you take the pain away
},
{
    100.28,102.2
     from one side, it maybe even improves a little bit
},
{
    102.2,104.16
     on the other side because you're not limping so much.
},
{
    104.16,105.06
     Right, no. Your mechanics or your gait mechanics improve. It makes everything better. away from one side, it maybe even improves a little bit on the other side because you're not limping so much. Right.
},
{
    105.06,108.82
     No, your mechanics or your gait mechanics and tool, it makes everything better.

     Pin to the top of the page.
},
{
    139.2,141.88
     Okay, so we already went through the scenario,
},
{
    141.88,143.88
     went through half of our video before the intro.
},
{
    143.88,144.72
     Yeah, that's right.
},
{
    144.72,146.98
     Okay, so we're gonna talk about how do you treat it.
},
{
    146.98,150.0
     Let's say your right hip is very painful.
},
{
    150.0,151.52
     And particularly when you walk on it,
},
{
    151.52,153.36
     very common with arthritis.
},
{
    153.36,156.82
     Now this is something a lot of people do not wanna do,
},
{
    156.82,159.08
     but just take some stress off the hip
},
{
    159.08,161.88
     when you walk by using a cane.
},
{
    161.88,163.6
     Yeah, absolutely.
},
{
    163.6,169.56
     I find with some people that, cause arthritis tends to flare up and it tends to calm down a lot of times by using
},
{
    169.96,177.52
     The cane it tends to calm down faster because you're taking weight off. It's not an irritated right and so you can
},
{
    177.76,179.84
     So we're not telling you that you're gonna use it permanently
},
{
    179.84,184.56
     Right, and we're not even saying that you have to do it everywhere if you don't feel like you want to do it in public
},
{
    185.08,187.86
     Dude, just do it in your home for a while limp instead
},
{
    187.86,192.88
     Yeah, limp instead which people think they look better when they're they're lumping then using a cane
},
{
    192.88,199.1
     Right, so if you got you know get a cane you adjusted so it's but at risk level and you're standing tall if it's your right hip
},
{
    199.1,200.94
     You use it in your left hand
},
{
    200.94,206.0
     That's one thing that a lot of people get confused. And just walk normal when the right leg is forward,
},
{
    206.0,209.16
     the cane goes down, taking weight off the painful hip.
},
{
    209.16,211.76
     We have some videos on how to walk with a cane,
},
{
    211.76,213.3
     how to adjust and walk with it.
},
{
    213.3,214.4
     You can look at those.
},
{
    214.4,217.32
     We wanna do a few more other options here.
},
{
    217.32,221.2
     The other one is a little pendulum exercise
},
{
    221.2,223.54
     or a kind of traction on the hip.
},
{
    223.54,225.18
     So you go up to your stairway,
},
{
    225.18,226.02
     we don't have a stairway here.
},
{
    226.02,227.88
     Yeah, this is a great way to start getting some movement
},
{
    227.88,231.24
     in the hip without hurting.
},
{
    231.24,232.08
     Right.
},
{
    232.08,235.1
     So my right side is the painful hip.
},
{
    235.1,236.32
     So I'm gonna go up with my left.
},
{
    236.32,238.66
     You're gonna have to, you hang on to the handrail.
},
{
    238.66,241.34
     In this case, I'm gonna use the bouillousteck for balance
},
{
    241.34,244.96
     because you need something for balance for most people.
},
{
    244.96,245.0
     Now I'm gonna let this leg, the sore leg, and bull your stick for balance because you need something for balance for most people.
},
{
    245.0,249.04
     Now I'm going to let this leg, the sore leg, completely relax.
},
{
    249.04,254.24
     All the muscles are jello and I'm just going to gently swing it forward and backwards.
},
{
    254.24,259.04
     And the reason why that hip to relax is the weight of your leg through relaxed muscles
},
{
    259.04,265.72
     is going to distract or pull the joint apart slightly so you don't have that bone on bone.
},
{
    265.72,266.76
     A little bit traction.
},
{
    266.76,269.0
     Right, you get a snowbill fluid.
},
{
    269.0,270.44
     If that's working out good,
},
{
    270.44,273.4
     you may want to put a little weight on.
},
{
    273.4,275.32
     You can use that ankle weight.
},
{
    275.32,278.64
     Now I've had people just put their winter boots on
},
{
    278.64,279.48
     up here in the north.
},
{
    279.48,280.32
     That's a good idea.
},
{
    280.32,283.76
     You know, a boot usually weighs a pound or two at least.
},
{
    283.76,285.4
     And you don't have to go out and buy anything.
},
{
    285.4,289.48
     And then your hip doesn't know if you got a boot down or an ankle weight.
},
{
    289.48,290.48
     And you do the same thing.
},
{
    290.48,292.8
     You're going to swing it for a minute or two.
},
{
    292.8,295.12
     And I find people have success with that.
},
{
    295.12,298.0
     It's pretty much a temporary thing, but it reduces things.
},
{
    298.0,299.0
     It's a good way to treat it.
},
{
    299.0,302.64
     Safety first, and it starts getting some movement in the hip, which you may not have had for
},
{
    302.64,304.32
     a while because it's been sore.
},
{
    304.32,305.52
     Right.
},
{
    305.52,307.84
     Now Bob, let's go on to the next one.
},
{
    307.84,309.72
     Along with pain in the hip,
},
{
    309.72,310.88
     particularly with arthritis,
},
{
    310.88,313.6
     usually there's a loss of range of motion.
},
{
    313.6,315.48
     Right, you can concur.
},
{
    315.48,316.32
     Right.
},
{
    316.32,317.96
     If you happen at the same time, I should say.
},
{
    317.96,320.12
     And if you can regain that range of motion
},
{
    320.12,320.96
     in the hip joint,
},
{
    320.96,323.08
     that can also make you feel better.
},
{
    323.08,325.36
     It's amazing to me that even if you regain
},
{
    325.36,327.16
     a little bit of the motion, a lot of times
},
{
    327.16,329.48
     it knocks the pain down at the same time.
},
{
    329.48,332.92
     So it really pays to do these stretches.
},
{
    332.92,334.0
     So let's show them.
},
{
    334.0,335.04
     Okay, which one do you want to do?
},
{
    335.04,337.2
     Well, I'll launch it, just, you're gonna have to.
},
{
    337.2,338.76
     No, I'm gonna get on the way.
},
{
    338.76,339.6
     Yeah.
},
{
    339.6,340.44
     You know, this is nice.
},
{
    340.44,341.28
     You can do this on a laying in bed,
},
{
    341.28,342.36
     and that's what we recommend.
},
{
    342.36,343.2
     Wake up and...
},
{
    343.2,344.16
     You could do it on the floor,
},
{
    344.16,345.56
     but then you gotta get on the floor. It works just as good in bed. That's what I recommend. Wake up and you could do it on the floor But then you got to get on the floor works
},
{
    345.56,353.64
     This is good in bed and you know simply lay like this and then you're going to see how far you can bring your knee up and
},
{
    354.56,358.28
     To your chest now if you can bring this knee all the way up like this
},
{
    358.28,364.8
     And this one you get about this far and all sudden oh it hurts or there's a we call a hard infill
},
{
    364.8,366.68
     Doesn't want to go any further.
},
{
    366.68,368.4
     That's the knee or that's the hip
},
{
    368.4,370.0
     you're going to want to work on.
},
{
    370.0,372.0
     So I'm going to do it with the right hip.
},
{
    372.0,374.44
     Let's say this one goes way up to here
},
{
    374.44,376.4
     and this one stops here and it's tight.
},
{
    376.4,379.08
     It's a little painful, but if you stretch on it,
},
{
    379.08,380.12
     hold and relax.
},
{
    380.12,381.64
     And after about 10 repetitions,
},
{
    381.64,384.56
     you notice the hip is starting to go up further
},
{
    384.56,385.0
     similar to the other leg. Then you're going to want to do that stretch, you know, at least once a day. and after about 10 repetitions you notice the hip is starting to go up further similar
},
{
    385.0,389.96
     to the other leg, then you're going to want to do that stretch at least once a day, but
},
{
    389.96,394.24
     I'm going to suggest two or three times a day, assuming it doesn't get real sore from
},
{
    394.24,395.24
     the stretch.
},
{
    395.24,398.72
     The first couple of times you stretch it, you may want to give it a weight to one next
},
{
    398.72,399.72
     day.
},
{
    399.72,401.68
     And I wouldn't expect that it would react that fast.
},
{
    401.68,405.3
     It may take weeks or even months before you start to equal
},
{
    405.3,410.98
     the other one again. That's a tough, fibrous material that is holding the hip together
},
{
    410.98,415.94
     in the socket, holding the hip in the socket, so it's not always that easy to stretch.
},
{
    415.94,420.5
     And so along with that one, you may want to check what we call the external rotation of
},
{
    420.5,425.38
     the hip. And I'm going to go this way so you can see what I'm doing. So with this leg
},
{
    425.38,431.76
     I'm gonna go over the top of the knee like this and I'm gonna let the knee drop this way.
},
{
    432.2,435.44
     So you can see this I can go this far and
},
{
    436.76,440.96
     the hip that has the pain may only go this far as
},
{
    441.68,447.08
     Opposed to like this like the other leg. So here all we do is gently
},
{
    447.08,453.44
     push the knee and relax. Pressure on, pressure off and if it feels good to keep
},
{
    453.44,458.04
     the pressure on you may use that option and hold it 15 to 30 seconds and not
},
{
    458.04,462.84
     do it as many repetitions. And but don't one or one thing you don't want to do is
},
{
    462.84,465.04
     is spend 20 minutes stretching your hip
},
{
    465.12,470.32
     10 repetitions on and off or three times 30 to 60 or 30
},
{
    470.72,476.08
     15 to 30 seconds is probably a good place and what's nice about that one you actually can do that one seated to
},
{
    476.08,481.26
     All right, that's gonna actually show how to do hip flexion the other way to you can actually just cross the knee
},
{
    482.12,485.68
     Cross the ankle over the opposite knee and you go
},
{
    485.68,489.32
     ahead and just push down like this and give it a bit of a stretch. A lot of
},
{
    489.32,493.48
     people tell me that a lot of patients that I have that hip hip arthritis, they
},
{
    493.48,497.32
     can't even get that leg up there. Yeah. I mean that's that's how tight it's become.
},
{
    497.32,500.64
     Sure. So they might have to even start with the knee down like this a little
},
{
    500.64,505.96
     lower and press it down but they they know right away what I'm talking about because
},
{
    505.96,509.32
     like I said they can maybe get the one up there but the other one I can't even get that
},
{
    509.32,513.92
     up there. So it's a great stretch. You're going to show a hip flexor.
},

    513.92,518.52
     Well before I go to that I just want to mention if taking a warm shower or you know a hot
},
{
    518.52,525.44
     pad helps. One thing because a hip has got a lot of muscle around it and on the individual there may be other soft tissue kind of
},
{
    526.36,532.46
     Padding that area sure so you want to one option that you could do is get a
},
{
    533.32,538.28
     Hot pad that goes in real deep right to do that. You're gonna need an ultra
},
{
    539.56,543.92
     Infrared infrared that all right, but here we put that there and
},
{
    545.84,546.84
     infrared, not all the way, but here we put that there and you know Bob is gonna show how deep it is.
},
{
    546.84,550.48
     I'm gonna show you how this, I always use a demonstration, so this is a thermotex
},
{
    550.48,552.88
     infrared pad, heating pad.
},
{
    552.88,559.04
     Now normal heating pads only go skin deep, they just barely penetrate the surface, a
},
{
    559.04,560.38
     couple millimeters.
},
{
    560.38,563.96
     This is how far the thermotex goes, 2.36 inches.
},
{
    563.96,571.72
     So what you can see here, what a big difference that that is that can start to go into the joint itself if I look at mr. Skeleton here mr. Sam
},
{
    573.44,574.68
     If I'm going through here
},
{
    574.68,578.48
     You can see how that can start getting into the joint itself where this one
},
{
    578.48,582.2
     Just is gonna heat up the outer surface and really not do much of anything
},
{
    582.2,586.44
     so and then you would do that the hot pack for you know
},
{
    586.88,590.48
     You can go up to 45 minutes with these and do the stretch afterwards
},
{
    590.48,593.88
     You're probably gonna find the stretch goes much better. That's right warm it up
},
{
    593.88,597.56
     And you know brand I just use this on a regular basis for our backs
},
{
    597.56,600.52
     We put them in our chair and we we leave against them
},
{
    600.52,602.88
     So I'm a thermotext has been really good to us
},
{
    602.88,608.56
     They have a really great discount for the people our subscribers, right? So we'll put a link below so you can check it out.
},
{
    609.84,613.92
     The next one now, this is where people are probably more mobile. They got hip pain
},
{
    614.8,619.92
     and they got fairly good balance. You can go up to a stairwell or in this case a stool,
},
{
    619.92,624.48
     but I'm going to stretch my right hip. So I'm going to come up to here and I'm going to go like
},
{
    624.48,627.0
     this and what's going on is my hip is flexing.
},
{
    627.0,632.0
     See how my knee is coming towards my chest. So that's a lot of hip flexion and it drops in.
},
{
    632.0,635.0
     You know, this has got to assume you have a good knee too.
},
{
    635.0,639.0
     But it will stretch your knee if you need some working on that. You get two joints at one.
},
{
    639.0,647.04
     The stairs work great for the spread. Because I've had even really quite elderly people able to do this one cause they start off on the first step.
},
{
    647.04,649.8
     They start there and a lot of times there's two railings.
},
{
    649.8,652.48
     So they have to hang on to.
},
{
    652.48,654.6
     And I have found most people can do that.
},
{
    654.6,657.36
     If they climb stairs, they can usually do this stretch.
},
{
    657.36,659.24
     Yep, as long as there's hand railings.
},
{
    659.24,661.16
     So it's a fantastic stretch to do.
},
{
    661.16,663.0
     Now I do mine way up like this.
},
{
    663.0,664.88
     Cause I'm younger and I'm,
},
{
    664.88,667.7
     but it really helps, I've got a side joint from so
},
{
    667.7,671.66
     You know, this is not only just doing the hip. It could be you know working other muscles
},
{
    671.66,675.14
     Well, what's nice is actually stretching the hip flexure on the opposite side, right?
},
{
    675.14,677.54
     So you're actually getting two stretches in one here
},
{
    680.54,686.2
     Which also helps hip pain so yeah, you're getting a double bonus or a great stretch to do.
},
{
    686.2,687.2
     My mic's falling off.
},
{
    687.2,689.0
     I don't know if people could hear me.
},
{
    689.0,690.0
     Oh, wow.
},
{
    690.0,691.0
     That's all right.
},
{
    691.0,692.0
     Sorry about that.
},
{
    692.0,693.0
     My mic's in the air.
},
{
    693.0,694.0
     My hands are good.
},
{
    694.0,695.0
     We're good.
},
{
    695.0,696.0
     All right.
},
{
    696.0,698.0
     Well, Brad, remember we can fix just about anything.
},
{
    698.0,699.0
     Except for broken hearts.
},
{
    699.0,700.0
     But we're working on that.
},
{
    700.0,702.0
     Yeah, well, we'll figure it out someday.
},
{
    702.0,703.0
     We'll persist.
},
{
    703.0,704.0
     All right.
},
{
    704.0,None
     Thanks for watching.
