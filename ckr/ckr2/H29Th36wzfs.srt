     Bob and Brad, the two most famous physical therapists on the internet.
},
{
    8.0,11.4
     Hi folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.
},
{
    11.4,12.4
     Brad Heineck, physical therapist.
},
{
    12.4,14.4
     Together we are the most famous physical therapists on the internet.
},
{
    14.4,15.9
     In our opinion, of course, Bob.
},
{
    15.9,20.52
     Brad, today we're going to talk about absolute best growing pain, self-treatments, exercises
},
{
    20.52,22.32
     and stretches that you can do.
},
{
    22.32,23.32
     Guaranteed.
},
{
    23.32,27.0
     So that's quite a complex sentence, Bob. Let's get into it.
},
{
    27.0,31.0
     Today we're going to talk about this, where you get a common injury,
},
{
    31.0,34.0
     especially in football and soccer, especially soccer, I think,
},
{
    34.0,36.0
     when you're doing those cross passes.
},
{
    36.0,38.0
     Right, lateral motion.
},
{
    38.0,41.0
     So it's very, you know, pretty easy to diagnose a lot of times.
},
{
    41.0,44.0
     You're going to get any pain in the groin or in the inner thigh.
},
{
    44.0,49.78
     Right. There's some actually some pretty good sized muscles in here the groin muscles consist of what four muscles?
},
{
    49.78,54.56
     Yep, at least a Dr. Longus, a Dr. Brevis, Pectinius. Now in addition to
},
{
    55.54,57.54
     Bringing the legs in and across
},
{
    57.74,60.28
     They also flex the the hip, right?
},
{
    60.28,64.84
     So you may have some pain Brad when you lift your leg up like this, right?
},
{
    68.08,73.04
     You're going to have some pain when you stretch your leg out to the side Right, one of the good tell-tale signs is if you squeeze your legs together like if you put a fist
},
{
    73.44,75.76
     Squeeze your legs together and that hurts in that area
},
{
    76.16,79.52
     Pretty good sign that you pulled the muscle there and pulled the groin muscle
},
{
    79.6,84.56
     Now the primary job of the groin is to bring the leg to the midline or to the center
},
{
    84.72,87.08
     But they do stabilize they do some flexion
},
{
    87.2,90.04
     There's no muscle. It just goes one thing. Right, right
},
{
    90.28,96.4
     So there's usually third degrees of injury, three degrees of injury, third degree, three degrees of injury
},
{
    96.84,100.44
     And the third degree is where you actually tear the muscle
},
{
    100.64,105.36
     So in that instance my guess is you're going to be seeing orthopedic surgeon quite often
},
{
    105.36,110.72
     because it's complete tear. Very uncommon I wouldn't think that happens that much. Yeah we're going
},
{
    110.72,115.2
     to kind of put that to the side. So we're talking about the first degree or second degree tears.
},
{
    116.64,120.24
     The first thing you're going to want to do is you're going to ice. You're going to start by
},
{
    120.24,126.34
     icing. Yeah cold pack. Because it's not going to feel very good. You got one? Yeah, we got one right here.
},
{
    126.34,128.38
     And you may do that in a recliner, laying down
},
{
    128.38,130.9
     and get that cold pack in there and just relax for 20,
},
{
    130.9,132.06
     30 minutes.
},
{
    132.06,134.54
     Avoid things that irritate it, that make it hurt.
},
{
    134.54,136.3
     Yeah, we actually have an old video, Brad,
},
{
    136.3,137.5
     of how to make an ice pack.
},
{
    137.5,138.38
     I think I'll link that up.
},
{
    138.38,139.3
     Yeah, put it up there, Brad.
},
{
    139.3,141.02
     Because it's actually very helpful.
},
{
    141.02,144.06
     Right, because especially some of these are new people who
},
{
    144.06,145.76
     haven't watched this before
},
{
    145.76,147.88
     and realize that we have a lot of videos
},
{
    147.88,149.88
     that can help them stay safe, healthy, strong,
},
{
    149.88,151.88
     vibrant, et cetera, et cetera.
},
{
    151.88,153.84
     Which makes us beg you that if you're watching
},
{
    153.84,155.96
     for the first time, please take a second to go ahead
},
{
    155.96,157.52
     and hit the subscribe button,
},
{
    157.52,159.12
     because we upload every day.
},
{
    159.12,160.6
     Back to the old, the Dr. Muscle.
},
{
    160.6,161.64
     Okay, growing through.
},
{
    161.64,163.24
     So we started off with some ice
},
{
    163.24,164.64
     and you're actually gonna rest it too.
},
{
    164.64,168.04
     I mean, you can't be out there playing when you're injured this.
},
{
    168.04,169.04
     Right.
},
{
    169.04,170.04
     Sorry.
},
{
    170.04,176.44
     You know, you maybe can do some things that don't hurt and probably like walking, but
},
{
    176.44,180.28
     anything that's going to put stress on that muscle you can't be doing.
},
{
    180.28,184.36
     So then this is kind of the crux of the treatment Brad, is you're going to start off some cross
},
{
    184.36,185.6
     fiber friction massage
},
{
    185.6,187.6
     Sure, and
},
{
    187.92,193.56
     Ideally you'd like to do this in long stretches, but you probably won't be able to because your hands are going to fatigue
},
{
    193.56,197.4
     Right, but very simply what you're gonna do is you're gonna get yourself in a position where
},
{
    199.0,202.68
     I'm gonna go this way Brad actually, let's say this is my injured leg Brad
},
{
    202.76,205.92
     I'll put it up here and the injury is going to be quite
},
{
    205.92,211.84
     up near the groin quite often, in the musculoskeletal tendonous junction, it can be in the muscle
},
{
    211.84,217.84
     itself, it can be where the tendon attaches to the bone too, but most often it's at where
},
{
    217.84,220.56
     the tendon beats the muscle.
},
{
    220.56,222.16
     And you'll know because it's going to be the tender spot.
},
{
    222.16,226.62
     It's going to be the tender spot, that's all you need to look for. Where does it hurt?
},
{
    226.62,229.56
     You can take one finger on top of another two fingers together
},
{
    229.56,234.08
     Whatever which are we going to do and you're going to go in there and you're going to find this tender spot and you're going to rub
},
{
    234.28,240.88
     Up and down across the fibers. That's why it's called cross fiber. The fibers go lengthwise to the leg
},
{
    240.88,244.64
     We're going to cross them. And this is going to get more blood flow to the area
},
{
    244.64,248.32
     The other thing that's going to help with Brad as you know is it's going to help
},
{
    248.96,252.48
     take care of some of that scar tissue that's getting laid down. Break up that scar tissue so
},
{
    252.48,256.64
     that when it heals it heals healthy and strong. Right because when scar tissue is laid down it's
},
{
    256.64,262.4
     a laid down in an erratic fashion so it's kind of like chaos. Right. It's like a web. You're doing
},
{
    262.4,265.68
     wonderful words today Bob. Yeah, I'm trying to come up
},
{
    270.08,272.08
     All right, we better keep going so this is gonna help those fibers align now The problem like I said is you know
},
{
    272.08,277.12
     Syriac's who invented this and by the way, you're gonna push pretty hard breath. Yeah, there's a lot of muscle there
},
{
    277.12,282.4
     So you want to get deep you want to get really onto that and and ideally what you should feel after
},
{
    282.96,289.0
     30 seconds 40 seconds maybe a minute is that it actually starts to feel a little bit better or the pain levels out.
},
{
    289.0,296.0
     If you do this and it just hurts, hurts, hurts and gets worse, back off, ice for a while and then come back to it again.
},
{
    296.0,297.0
     Right, it's too early.
},
{
    297.0,302.0
     So, but they recommend, C-rex recommends 20 minutes, 2 times a week for 3 to 4 weeks.
},
{
    302.0,303.0
     Sure.
},
{
    303.0,305.32
     But most people can't do it, there's nobody
},
{
    305.32,309.32
     there. When you're doing that cross-fiction your fingers get tired, mine get tired after
},
{
    309.32,313.36
     about five minutes. And that's usually what I would say is five minutes you could do that
},
{
    313.36,321.48
     four times a week and you know it you can actually ice then afterwards if you fire it
},
{
    321.48,328.88
     up a little bit. Then what are we going to do? Well after that then after a few I'd say you know after the pain starts to come down
},
{
    328.88,332.4
     You're gonna want to start doing some strengthening and stretching to that area
},
{
    332.96,337.12
     One of the strengthening techniques you can do is just take a small ball
},
{
    338.72,342.96
     I'm having trouble saying that. Yeah here just use it. Okay. I don't know what you're talking about
},
{
    342.96,346.0
     You can do this laying down or you can do it sitting like this, Brad.
},
{
    346.0,348.2
     You can just gonna do some squeezes.
},
{
    348.2,350.0
     And they're gonna be gentle to start with.
},
{
    350.0,350.84
     Yeah.
},
{
    350.84,352.32
     If they shouldn't create any sharp pain,
},
{
    352.32,354.96
     maybe a little discomfort, like a good working pain.
},
{
    354.96,355.8
     Right.
},
{
    355.8,357.68
     Little, you know, you're bumping into the pain,
},
{
    357.68,358.6
     as we like to say.
},
{
    358.6,361.52
     10, 15 at the most is what I typically say.
},
{
    361.52,363.16
     Sure, start off with that.
},
{
    363.16,365.94
     And then eventually you can do like three sets of ten sure
},
{
    365.94,370.82
     Sure, give a little you know minute rest in between and you can work and rub that muscle a little bit
},
{
    370.82,374.72
     And then if you want to work some other parts of the fiber you can actually take a larger ball
},
{
    376.02,379.56
     You know and you could do the same thing here or again you could do a laying down
},
{
    379.88,382.82
     Right and start doing squeezes like this right again
},
{
    382.82,385.6
     It's getting some of the different fibers now because we're further upright.
},
{
    385.6,388.88
     The hips are more abducted so different fibers have to work.
},
{
    388.88,392.56
     And you can even go to the largest ball of all, the exercise ball.
},
{
    392.56,395.72
     For those athletic people who are getting full range of motion,
},
{
    395.72,399.12
     plastic, plain soccer, football, they're going to really work those legs.
},
{
    399.12,401.28
     And I would even start doing a little bit,
},
{
    401.28,404.0
     later on Brad, maybe do a little bit of dynamics.
},
{
    404.0,405.82
     Go ahead and squeeze and bring it up here. Now you get a little bit of you know, later on Brad maybe do a little bit of dynamics. Go ahead and squeeze and bring it up here.
},
{
    405.82,411.48
     Now you got a little bit of getting the hip flexors that it's I mean it's acting as a hip flexor and a hip adductor.
},
{
    411.88,415.16
     Absolutely. So this is a little more advanced. Okay, that's enough Bob.
},
{
    417.56,420.0
     Brad, try just to keep me on track. It's really difficult.
},
{
    420.32,426.12
     All right, if you don't have a ball one of the simple things you can start with is just laying on your side and doing hip adduction
},
{
    426.12,430.76
     Sure, sure. You want to do it? No, okay? I'll do it. I had something else on my mind
},
{
    430.76,433.58
     That's why I said no, I didn't want to miss going okay
},
{
    433.68,438.6
     So really just lay on your side got the other leg up and you're gonna just start doing some lifts like this
},
{
    438.6,443.6
     And this is this is one of those that looks a lot harder than it looks a lot easier than it is right
},
{
    443.6,449.36
     Yeah, I know I didn't say that right. I think I get that speech therapist. Yeah, you can do a little bit of hold when you bring it up
},
{
    450.0,455.08
     It's not hard for the first six and then it starts getting a little bit more difficult
},
{
    455.08,459.52
     Right, you have to understand I'm 56 years old though too. So I might not be a good example
},
{
    459.52,464.36
     He left the information out. I let it out. Yeah. All right. What about the stretch of the bob?
},
{
    464.8,470.64
     Do you yeah, we'll show the other the band? Oh, yeah, cuz that's a little more advanced
},
{
    470.68,477.52
     All right, the stretches that we're gonna want you to do before an event are different than what we want you to do after an event
},
{
    477.88,479.88
     Especially when you're in what we call
},
{
    480.4,484.44
     Sports where you need a lot of power and you know quick stop and start yeah
},
{
    484.92,485.64
     You want to
},
{
    485.64,490.04
     do dynamic stretching because if you stretch the fibers too much before an
},
{
    490.04,496.12
     event like that you actually take some of the power away. So very simple
},
{
    496.12,502.84
     what you're gonna do, I'll give Lonnie a second to adjust the camera. This is my
},
{
    502.84,505.62
     involved leg. You're gonna do it on both sides but you're going
},
{
    505.62,509.46
     to do some swings like this and I think you've seen people doing this right Brad?
},
{
    509.46,512.08
     I think in a lot of sports these are very common.
},
{
    512.08,513.08
     Right.
},
{
    513.08,517.84
     And the leg is relaxed, you're just getting the muscles to stretch and relax at the same
},
{
    517.84,518.84
     time.
},
{
    518.84,521.48
     So you can go straight back and you can also turn your foot this way a little bit because
},
{
    521.48,524.98
     it starts getting a little bit of, but the other one you're going to want to do is actually
},
{
    524.98,526.84
     going back and forth like this.
},
{
    526.84,528.64
     This is one where if you're up against a wall
},
{
    528.64,530.92
     in front of you is the way I kinda like to do it,
},
{
    530.92,533.72
     then you're swinging this way if the wall is here,
},
{
    533.72,536.96
     use your imagination there, let that leg relax.
},
{
    536.96,539.96
     And obviously, you wanna, don't take it to the point
},
{
    539.96,541.48
     where you're actually injuring things,
},
{
    541.48,547.44
     but start off with small spans, oscill oscillations and then work to larger ones
},
{
    548.08,551.76
     Yeah, use good judgment. You remember you got to injure muscle there
},
{
    551.76,557.32
     You don't want to re-injure it by doing too aggressive of a warm-up now in the evenings then you can do static stretches
},
{
    557.32,561.12
     That's where you can do a stretch where you can go ahead and you know go ahead
},
{
    561.8,565.66
     Well, I'm gonna show this one Brad. Give me a pillow. Yeah, this is a good one to do
},
{
    565.66,568.54
     You're gonna put your knee down your down Lonnie
},
{
    569.36,571.36
     I'm stretching this side
},
{
    571.74,573.78
     I'm gonna bring the foot out like this and
},
{
    574.96,576.96
     This chair is in the way Brad
},
{
    578.32,580.32
     I'll come over here more
},
{
    580.88,588.1
     So it happens when you're six and a half foot tall, you need a big room So I'm starting with the toe forward first for 30 seconds
},
{
    588.1,588.6
     Sure
},
{
    588.6,596.0
     Okay, and then I'm gonna put the toe at a 45 degree angle Brad. Yeah, so we're talking about this right here
},
{
    596.0,598.0
     So straightforward
},
{
    598.0,601.32
     45 and then you're gonna go up to 90 for the last 30 seconds
},
{
    601.32,607.0
     And what that's doing is that's rotating the hip where these muscles connect where we're getting a stretch in the hip as well
},
{
    607.0,611.0
     again one of those things that looks looks mini-skill but it can be real
},
{
    611.0,614.16
     helpful. Right this is just a good stretch you want to have good posture right
},
{
    614.16,618.48
     you want to don't want to be leaning this way or this way sure and when we
},
{
    618.48,625.48
     finish off Brad what with that dynamic strengthening oh yeah with the band. This is a if you can use some
},
{
    625.96,627.96
     Thera-tubing you get a wrist
},
{
    629.6,637.0
     Or foot strap foot strap ankle strap and with this I will start how we doing on you can you
},
{
    638.36,640.36
     Yeah, that's fine if you just that's all you're yeah
},
{
    640.36,642.72
     We don't they don't want to see my face and that anyways
},
{
    643.04,646.32
     So you see the resistance, I vary the resistance
},
{
    646.32,651.36
     obviously by how far I walk way or by the color of the band, but I'm going to go in flexion
},
{
    652.48,659.36
     Then I can turn 90 degrees and here we're going right directly at those hip abductors that growing muscles working directly right now
},
{
    659.72,662.6
     Don't overwork it when it gets fatigued stop
},
{
    662.88,666.8
     But you know and you could go all four directions you could work this way
},
{
    667.6,671.04
     Certainly not going to hurt you that's certainly that's going to be good for your hip overall
},
{
    671.6,677.04
     Exactly and this way and it's good for your balance. It's one of those things like Bob mentioned
},
{
    677.04,682.8
     This is getting you ready for the activity again. It's that right before you're going to go out and do the real thing
},
{
    683.12,685.12
     Exactly so thanks for watching.
},
{
    685.12,685.62
     All right.
