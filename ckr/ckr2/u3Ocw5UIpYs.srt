    0.0,6.56
     Hey everybody, it's Doctor Jo and my Lord of the Rings kitty says hello my precious.
},
{
    6.56,10.52
     Today I'm going to show you some stretches in real time for your neck.
},
{
    10.52,19.52
     So let's get started.
},
{
    19.52,23.16
     To start off we're just going to get those muscles moving a little bit, warm them up
},
{
    23.16,24.48
     and then do the stretches.
},
{
    24.48,29.12
     So to start off with you're just going to rotate your muscles moving a little bit, warm them up, and then do the stretches. So to start off with, you're just going to rotate your head back and forth, but the thing you want
},
{
    29.12,34.32
     to do is keep your chin up in this neutral position. So you don't want to drop it down.
},
{
    34.32,39.92
     You want to keep it up and then just rotate to the side. So we're just going to do five on each side
},
{
    39.92,46.04
     and it can be kind of a continuous motion. You're just really kind of loosening everything up
},
{
    46.04,48.52
     so you're not stretching those muscles cold
},
{
    48.52,50.88
     because you don't really want to stretch muscles cold
},
{
    50.88,54.16
     unless you have to like first thing in the morning.
},
{
    54.16,55.12
     But other than that,
},
{
    55.12,56.96
     you really want to kind of loosen them up a little bit.
},
{
    56.96,59.82
     So that's five on each side.
},
{
    59.82,62.62
     Then the next one is going to be a side bend.
},
{
    62.62,66.2
     So you're taking your ear down towards your shoulder,
},
{
    66.2,68.56
     but it's not bringing your shoulder up,
},
{
    68.56,70.04
     it's bringing that ear down.
},
{
    70.04,73.36
     But again, keep that head kind of in that neutral position
},
{
    73.36,76.84
     and then just go down your shoulder
},
{
    76.84,79.08
     and then alternate back and forth.
},
{
    79.08,81.38
     So again, just do about five of these.
},
{
    81.38,84.24
     You're really just kind of loosening everything up.
},
{
    84.24,88.44
     You don't have to go super slow. you don't have to go super fast, you're just trying
},
{
    88.44,92.88
     to get those muscles kind of awake and ready to go a little bit warm so when
},
{
    92.88,97.6
     you're stretching you can actually get some benefit from the stretch. And then
},
{
    97.6,101.96
     the last one of the movements is just going to be an up and down. Now with the
},
{
    101.96,106.0
     going back up this way be a little careful if you have neck
},
{
    106.0,112.0
     issues because sometimes this can make people feel dizzy. So you know if that makes you feel dizzy
},
{
    112.0,117.04
     going all the way up, just bring it up a little bit, bring your eyes up, and then bring your chin
},
{
    117.04,125.2
     towards your chest. So again just about five of these, these kind of stretches work really well for headaches or if you have some
},
{
    125.2,131.4
     neck spasms or maybe if you've strained it. A lot of times people wake up with a
},
{
    131.4,134.96
     crick in their neck. Sometimes these really help as well so let's just do one
},
{
    134.96,140.44
     more of each of those. Then the next one to get everything going before we go
},
{
    140.44,149.72
     into the stretches is a chin tuck and it's not chin tuck going down this way. it's chin tuck coming in this way. So you're gonna have lots of chin to make
},
{
    149.72,152.96
     it look like, like you got lots of folds in the neck but that's kind of what you
},
{
    152.96,156.32
     want to do. So it's it's something you might not want to do around a whole lot
},
{
    156.32,160.72
     of other people unless you don't care. But basically what I like to do to know
},
{
    160.72,169.72
     that you're doing it correctly is place your finger on your chin and then move that chin away. So this time you're going to hold it for
},
{
    169.72,173.72
     about three seconds. It doesn't have to be exact and then come back and then you
},
{
    173.72,178.24
     can see that I've kind of corrected myself and then you can move it again.
},
{
    178.24,188.96
     Do that just about three maybe five seconds and then relax. Come back in, do that again, a little
},
{
    188.96,194.84
     hold and again this is just kind of putting that spine in a neutral position
},
{
    194.84,198.12
     getting those muscles where they're supposed to be working everything a
},
{
    198.12,203.46
     little bit but see how my chin is going straight back it's not coming down and
},
{
    203.46,205.36
     tucking in like that it's just going straight back. It's not coming down and tucking in like that.
},
{
    205.36,207.04
     It's just going straight back.
},
{
    207.04,209.4
     Almost like if I had my hand back there
},
{
    209.4,212.4
     and I'm trying to push into my hand.
},
{
    212.4,214.6
     Okay, so now we're gonna go into the stretches.
},
{
    214.6,217.0
     Stretches, the best results for stretches
},
{
    217.0,220.52
     is holding it for 30 seconds and doing three of each of them.
},
{
    220.52,223.68
     So I'm gonna use my timer to get the stretches in.
},
{
    223.68,230.32
     We're gonna start off with just a trap stretch through your upper traps. And what I like to do with
},
{
    230.32,235.04
     the hand of the side you're stretching is really just kind of hang it down. If
},
{
    235.04,238.84
     you have a chair that you can hold onto, hold onto it because that keeps the
},
{
    238.84,241.68
     shoulder down. Because if you're stretching and your shoulder comes up,
},
{
    241.68,247.6
     you're not really stretching those upper trap muscles. So what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna start this and we're gonna get going. Just
},
{
    247.6,253.28
     take the opposite hand and pull over. So getting a nice stretch in there, a nice
},
{
    253.28,258.08
     hold. You want those stretches to be comfortable. You don't want pain in there.
},
{
    258.08,263.56
     If you happen to feel a little pop but it's not painful, that's okay. That's just
},
{
    263.56,265.6
     your spine kind of adjusting itself and realigning itself. But if it's not painful that's okay that's just your spine kind of adjusting
},
{
    265.6,269.88
     itself and realigning itself but if it's painful death definitely stop but
},
{
    269.88,274.2
     again this is really good for like those neck spasms you have a lot of times
},
{
    274.2,278.12
     tension headaches you just need to get that stretch in there and that really
},
{
    278.12,284.24
     helps loosen it up. Sometimes you can alternate sides I like alternating
},
{
    284.24,289.12
     sides just because you give the other side a little bit of a break. If you don't alternate sides, then
},
{
    289.12,292.76
     you want to give yourself about a five to ten second break in between. So
},
{
    292.76,297.16
     let's go ahead and do the other side. So holding it down onto that chair and then
},
{
    297.16,301.56
     pulling over to the other side. Again, try and keep that head in this kind of
},
{
    301.56,309.9
     neutral position. So I'm not turning down this way I'm just looking straight ahead and trying to pull that ear towards the other side so
},
{
    309.9,313.38
     you should feel that stretch kind of right in through there you might see my
},
{
    313.38,317.5
     muscle coming out just a little bit and that just means that it's stretching it
},
{
    317.5,322.9
     should feel good that good kind of hurt not that just hurt hurt if it's just a
},
{
    322.9,332.26
     hurt hurt then it's probably something that you really really need to go get checked out. Alright, the other side.
},
{
    333.04,338.76
     Nice stretch there, nice and relaxed. And sometimes if your muscles are really tight
},
{
    338.76,342.96
     and they start to loosen up, you might be holding here and then you don't feel
},
{
    342.96,348.16
     the stretch quite as much anymore and then just give it a little bit more of a pull until you feel that
},
{
    348.16,352.0
     tension again. So you don't have to hold it in that same spot the whole time. You
},
{
    352.0,356.56
     can push it a little bit again if it's not painful you know. Stretching's
},
{
    356.56,361.72
     uncomfortable. It's you know it's maybe it hurts a little bit but it feels good
},
{
    361.72,370.92
     kind of thing.
},
{
    376.12,381.16
     Remember again if you feel like it's something that's trying to pop in there, if it's not painful that's okay but if it hurts, if it's like oh that
},
{
    381.16,384.88
     just doesn't feel right, definitely stop because the neck is something that you
},
{
    384.88,387.6
     you don't want to be pulling and tugging on it if there's like, oh, that just doesn't feel right. Definitely stop because the neck is something that you don't wanna be pulling and tugging on it
},
{
    387.6,390.68
     if there's something not good going on in there.
},
{
    390.68,394.0
     This is really just for muscle strain,
},
{
    394.0,398.56
     those tension headaches, maybe a spasm in there,
},
{
    398.56,401.24
     something like that, just to kinda get everything
},
{
    401.24,402.36
     moving in there again.
},
{
    405.68,406.56
     Nice hold.
},
{
    413.36,431.84
     Starting to feel those muscles getting warmed up there. Nice and loose, nice and comfortable. Nice deep breaths.
},
{
    431.84,437.88
     Alright, let's go back to the other side.
},
{
    437.88,441.36
     Again keeping that shoulder down, see if I don't hold on it kind of comes up a little
},
{
    441.36,449.2
     bit and so you really want to kind of hold it down and then just get that nice stretch in there. If you have a little bit of a
},
{
    449.2,453.2
     headache sometimes just taking some deep breaths in through your nose and out
},
{
    453.2,457.24
     through your mouth get some extra oxygen in there and that helps with the
},
{
    457.24,462.2
     circulation that sometimes makes you feel better as well so just kind of a
},
{
    464.48,465.32
     and sometimes that helps those muscles relax just a little bit as well. So the kind of a...
},
{
    467.48,469.38
     And sometimes that helps those muscles relax just a little bit as well.
},
{
    469.38,472.52
     So the next one is gonna be
},
{
    472.52,475.64
     for your levator scat muscle.
},
{
    475.64,478.24
     And the reason you want to stretch that one out
},
{
    478.24,480.6
     is that muscle in the back there.
},
{
    480.6,481.6
     A lot of times you're like,
},
{
    481.6,482.96
     oh, that hurts right there.
},
{
    482.96,484.96
     That's where that levator scat muscle is.
},
{
    484.96,485.88
     It comes up and if you have a lot of times you're like, oh, that hurts right there. That's, that's where that levator scap muscle is. It comes up.
},
{
    486.2,487.8
     And if you have a lot of tension,
},
{
    488.4,491.4
     a lot of times people hold their tension like this and that's putting a lot of
},
{
    491.4,493.32
     stress on that muscle. So if you stretch it out,
},
{
    493.32,495.04
     a lot of times you can get that tension out of there.
},
{
    495.32,498.86
     This one's kind of a weird position. If you have shoulder issues,
},
{
    498.86,502.64
     you might have to modify it a little bit, but the side you want to stretch,
},
{
    502.76,506.24
     you're going to bring that hand up this way. Almost
},
{
    506.24,510.4
     where your elbow is trying to go up towards the ceiling. It doesn't have to go all the way up.
},
{
    510.4,514.96
     It can be about here, but that's the goal is to try and get it up. Then take the other hand,
},
{
    515.6,521.2
     put it behind your head, and go out at an angle. So it's almost like you're trying to take your head
},
{
    521.2,527.4
     over towards your opposite knee. So it's kind of at that angle. So it's going to be this motion.
},
{
    528.92,530.04
     Get that started.
},
{
    531.12,534.4
     I have to reset it first and then we can go. All right.
},
{
    534.4,537.56
     So behind my head and pulling over.
},
{
    537.76,541.16
     So again, it's going to be more at an angle now.
},
{
    541.16,544.12
     And that's kind of getting that levator scapula muscle.
},
{
    544.4,545.12
     And that one is a big cause of tension, now and that's kind of getting that levator scapula muscle and and that
},
{
    545.12,552.72
     one is a big cause of tension, a lot of pain and it's connected to the scapula
},
{
    552.72,558.68
     and that has over 20 muscle attachments to it so anytime one of those muscles
},
{
    558.68,562.56
     or several of those muscles aren't working correctly it can cause a whole
},
{
    562.56,565.1
     lot of problems in the neck, upper
},
{
    565.1,566.82
     back, and shoulder area.
},
{
    566.82,569.5
     So this is definitely something you really want to stretch.
},
{
    569.5,579.46
     Now we're going to switch sides up this way and then pulling across.
},
{
    579.46,582.3
     So again, I'm almost looking at that opposite knee.
},
{
    582.3,585.14
     It's not over here, it's not straight down. It's
},
{
    585.14,591.04
     kind of at an angle. You're going to feel it in that area right through there. And again,
},
{
    591.04,597.92
     you want it to be that comfortable. You don't want it to be painful. Just a nice tension,
},
{
    597.92,609.84
     nice stretch in there. The great thing about these is you can easily do them at your desk.
},
{
    609.84,615.88
     If you're working a lot, a lot of times people tend to kind of get their head going forward
},
{
    615.88,621.48
     leaning in towards the computer and then you're so busy what you're doing on the computer
},
{
    621.48,627.68
     that two hours later you look up and you have a lot of neck pain and upper back pain because you've been in a terrible
},
{
    627.68,631.36
     position the whole time. So just doing some of these stretches while you're
},
{
    631.36,636.12
     sitting there even if you're at work is pretty easy to do without having to get
},
{
    636.12,641.04
     on the ground or get any kind of equipment or anything like that.
},
{
    650.44,653.24
     And then back again. Try and keep your back pretty upright as well.
},
{
    653.24,655.04
     Don't kind of pull it forward.
},
{
    655.04,657.92
     That takes away from that stretch a little bit.
},
{
    657.92,659.52
     If you do some, that's okay.
},
{
    659.52,663.0
     Sometimes if you're stretching and nobody's watching you, you're not quite sure.
},
{
    663.0,667.36
     But just kind of push back into the chair every once in a while to make sure that you're sitting fairly
},
{
    667.36,674.28
     upright and so then you'll end up making your backs sore as well.
},
{
    674.28,695.4
     Nice big stretch.
},
{
    695.4,701.16
     Make sure that you have some deodorant on because you're right there in that armpit.
},
{
    701.16,709.28
     Then you can do the sniff check without being obvious you're like no I'm just doing some stretches right now.
},
{
    709.88,717.0
     Luckily my Lord of Ring Kitties got me covered smelling good. Alright and now
},
{
    717.0,723.36
     for the last one on this side. Up and hold.
},
{
    721.8,727.04
     up and hold.
},
{
    730.14,732.4
     Nice stretch on this side, nice and relaxed.
},
{
    734.6,736.74
     And again, if you feel like it's hurting, a lot of times the reason you don't wanna stretch,
},
{
    736.74,738.68
     if you're having a lot of pain,
},
{
    738.68,742.28
     is because your muscles go into what we call muscle guarding,
},
{
    742.28,744.28
     and you can try and push on it and push on it,
},
{
    744.28,746.96
     but if they're guarding, they're actually just pulling back.
},
{
    746.96,749.08
     And so that extra pain lots of times
},
{
    749.08,754.08
     is counter beneficial of the stretching.
},
{
    754.16,757.2
     So there's where your stretches for your neck
},
{
    757.2,759.4
     to make sure that you loosen everything up.
},
{
    759.4,762.88
     If you have tension headaches, muscle spasms,
},
{
    762.88,764.8
     just maybe a strain in your neck,
},
{
    764.8,766.2
     or maybe even you wake up in the morning
},
{
    766.2,769.24
     you got that crick in your neck that you don't remember doing anything to it
},
{
    769.24,772.56
     maybe you just slept on it wrong. If you have any questions leave them in the comment section
},
{
    772.56,781.44
     so I check out some other videos go to AskDoctorJo.com and remember be safe, have fun, and I hope you feel better soon.
