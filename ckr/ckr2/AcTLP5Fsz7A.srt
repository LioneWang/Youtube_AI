     Hello everyone, this is Paul from OrthoEvalpal and today I want to talk to you about Oshgut
},
{
    5.34,6.34
     Slaughter's disease.
},
{
    6.34,12.6
     Now, I receive tons of questions on YouTube about what Oshguts is, how long it takes to
},
{
    12.6,15.0
     get better, and all kinds of questions about it.
},
{
    15.0,19.8
     So I thought today I would do a more comprehensive evaluation and talk about this a little bit
},
{
    19.8,29.32
     more, talk about how we treat it some so that you can try to help yourself at home if this is kind of like a light case of hosgurt slaughter disease, okay?
},
{
    29.32,34.9
     So what is it first of all? Well, let's just talk about the anatomy a little bit the quad muscle
},
{
    34.9,38.44
     which is a very powerful muscle comes over the front of the thigh like this and
},
{
    39.12,44.56
     Comes down over the kneecap and becomes a tendon and that tendon is a structure that
},
{
    46.08,53.2
     over the kneecap and becomes a tendon. And that tendon is a structure that comes all the way down here and attaches to what we call the tibial tubercle. Now what happens is this pulls and pulls
},
{
    53.2,59.84
     and pulls on this area. Now when you're an adolescent and your growth plates in this bone right here
},
{
    59.84,65.84
     are not fully closed, those new growing cells, those new growing bone cells right there are
},
{
    65.84,71.68
     soft and that quad muscle pulls and pulls and pulls. So for people who do a lot of squatting,
},
{
    71.68,78.96
     jumping, cutting, changing of directions, that pulls a lot on that and basically like pulling
},
{
    78.96,85.98
     the skin on your arm, it goes up like this and then becomes hardened over time producing this
},
{
    85.98,90.32
     bump that can be very painful to touch and can become very inflamed in that
},
{
    90.32,97.64
     area. So who do we see this in most oftentimes? We see this in 11 to 14
},
{
    97.64,102.36
     year olds. We see in people who are very active so athletes or people who do a lot
},
{
    102.36,105.04
     of work where they are squatting and lifting a lot
},
{
    105.94,110.04
     Because this continues to pull and pull and pull it just gets irritated and inflamed
},
{
    110.68,111.74
     so
},
{
    111.74,113.74
     How do you treat this? Well?
},
{
    114.0,120.84
     You can you can treat this by resting it and that's the hardest part because usually the people who get this are very active
},
{
    120.84,122.34
     And they want to continue to be active
},
{
    122.34,128.88
     So what we do is we try to get people to slow down at least for three to four weeks and do other activities such as
},
{
    128.88,134.96
     swimming or biking or some upper body work, core stabilization, hip strengthening. There's
},
{
    134.96,142.18
     a lot of things you can do and not cause agitation to this part of your tendon. So letting it
},
{
    142.18,151.76
     rest a little bit is important. The other thing that I like to do is some flexibility activities. Okay, so the first exercise I like is to help
},
{
    151.76,155.76
     increase the flexibility of the calf muscle. I like to increase the
},
{
    155.76,160.76
     flexibility of the quad muscle, hip flexor muscle, and hamstrings. So I'll give
},
{
    160.76,164.96
     you a demonstration on how to do one of each of these. And remember, do these nice
},
{
    164.96,165.4
     and easy
},
{
    165.4,167.4
     They are a low load long duration
},
{
    168.2,170.92
     Stretches we like to hold for about 30 seconds a piece
},
{
    171.0,174.26
     You can do three to five repetitions of each stretch
},
{
    174.26,179.8
     But we will just demo one of each today so that you can have some idea of how to begin stretching
},
{
    179.8,183.96
     So the first thing I like to do would be a slant board stretch, which is for the calf
},
{
    184.0,185.6
     So the first thing I like to do would be a slant board stretch, which is for the calf.
},
{
    190.08,190.88
     Basically we would have this up against a wall so you can hold on to the wall like this
},
{
    195.2,200.08
     and you just lean forward while the foot is inclined. We don't like to step off of the edge of a step because it can put a lot of pressure under the forefoot. This is the best way to stretch
},
{
    200.08,210.02
     your calf muscle right here. So it would be a 30 second stretch and we would do several repetitions and step off in between and switch legs each time. Okay.
},
{
    210.02,213.98
     The next stretch is going to be a quad stretch. So what you do is you put one
},
{
    213.98,218.66
     hand on the table and grab a hold of this leg. The important part here is not
},
{
    218.66,222.1
     just to bend the knee because that can put a little tension here but to try to
},
{
    222.1,229.4
     pull the thigh back while keeping the upper body nice and straight so that the stretch is in the front of this thigh right here.
},
{
    229.4,230.4
     Okay?
},
{
    230.4,233.0
     Again, that would be a 30 second stretch.
},
{
    233.0,236.28
     Now what I want you to do is we're going to do a hip flexor stretch.
},
{
    236.28,240.52
     So the right leg is going to be out in front.
},
{
    240.52,244.32
     This leg will be straight, trying to drive the pelvis forward.
},
{
    244.32,248.18
     And you should feel this pull right in front of the hip and in front of the thigh
},
{
    248.52,250.88
     And again you hold that for 30 seconds
},
{
    251.4,256.52
     The next stretch I like to do is a hamstring stretch. So I'm gonna have you lie right down on your back
},
{
    261.36,268.08
     Take a towel a sheet or anything that's solid, like a belt, and you put it around the
},
{
    268.08,273.56
     base of the foot, keep the leg straight, and you pull until you feel a good stretch down
},
{
    273.56,275.4
     in the hamstrings over here.
},
{
    275.4,281.72
     Again, you hold that for about 30 seconds, and you would do five repetitions on each
},
{
    281.72,282.72
     side.
},
{
    282.72,286.8
     So these are nice little flexibility exercises that are not going to agitate the Oshgut
},
{
    286.8,290.52
     Schlotters and are good to do just to help improve your mobility.
},
{
    290.52,294.48
     Now I'm going to let you sit up.
},
{
    294.48,298.64
     There are other factors to why people develop Oshgut Schlotters.
},
{
    298.64,303.12
     And part of it could be foot posture and knee posture.
},
{
    303.12,309.2
     So a knee that collapses in because of a flat foot or maybe just the way a person is made
},
{
    309.2,314.22
     can increase the angle here and cause an excessive amount of tension.
},
{
    314.22,320.12
     So if people have really flat feet, I recommend kind of an off the shelf orthotic, something
},
{
    320.12,326.02
     that has a really nice arch to it and supports the heel with a nice deep heel
},
{
    326.02,330.58
     cup like this. When you put that into the shoe it helps to prevent the knees
},
{
    330.58,335.9
     from collapsing inward and can be helpful in terms of giving good alignment
},
{
    335.9,339.62
     to the knee. So it's not going to be like miraculous you put in a pair of
},
{
    339.62,343.06
     orthotics and your ostrich slaughter starts to feel better. What we do with
},
{
    343.06,349.6
     ostrich slaughter is we give it kind of a shotgun effect. We try to line everything up, we try to decrease inflammation, we try to
},
{
    349.6,354.56
     rest up a little bit so it can settle down. Now let's say you're going to continue to be active
},
{
    354.56,360.48
     and you have a last big race for the season and you're going to run it no matter what,
},
{
    360.48,365.54
     even if you have Oshkort's or not. One of the ways you can help take pressure off of the area
},
{
    365.54,369.2
     is to use a what we call a teletendent strap.
},
{
    370.26,373.78
     As you can see here, you put the strap on there.
},
{
    373.78,375.62
     Many different types out there.
},
{
    375.62,377.06
     This is one I like in particular
},
{
    377.06,380.18
     because it's not too elastic like.
},
{
    380.18,381.98
     So what you do is you put the strap on
},
{
    381.98,384.42
     between the bottom of the kneecap
},
{
    384.42,390.08
     and the Oshgord slaughter bump and you put it right over the tendon. It needs to be tight enough
},
{
    390.08,394.96
     so it is causing some pressure on the tendon and basically what happens here when this big
},
{
    394.96,401.84
     powerful muscle contracts instead of pulling all the pressure through the attachment down here,
},
{
    401.84,405.52
     you're actually dissipating force and pressure through the strap.
},
{
    406.72,410.72
     And by doing that, you can take that pressure off down there and it can actually feel a little bit
},
{
    410.72,417.44
     better and not inflame it quite as much. Let's say you are getting older, you've had
},
{
    417.44,422.64
     oscuch swatters when you were younger and you don't have a lot of discomfort, it's not very
},
{
    422.64,425.5
     inflamed, but you have this nice big bump down here.
},
{
    425.5,433.0
     And that hurts every time you kneel on the floor. Maybe you are a carpet layer or you lay hardwood floors.
},
{
    433.0,436.0
     Or maybe you're a carpenter and you're doing a lot of work on your knees.
},
{
    436.0,445.04
     That is going to kill you. This is the biggest complaint that adults have after they've developed Oshkarlaughter's when they're younger. So what
},
{
    445.04,449.6
     I recommend with those folks would be to wear a knee pad like this. This is a
},
{
    449.6,454.16
     straight-up volleyball knee pad. It's nice and thick and it's nice and cushy.
},
{
    454.16,459.36
     You put that right over that spot to help protect it and life will become a lot
},
{
    459.36,463.64
     easier. Okay so that is something you want to do is protect that from getting
},
{
    463.64,466.62
     struck on hard surfaces all the time now
},
{
    467.44,471.74
     Other things you can do to add to this would be taking anti-inflammatories
},
{
    471.74,476.62
     You know and you should do this with your consultation with your PCP something like Advil
},
{
    476.62,479.5
     I'd be profan or leave any of those non-steror lantain
},
{
    479.74,488.0
     Flouries can help decrease that inflammation in that area if you're having a significant amount of pain in that region,
},
{
    488.0,491.0
     you can also do ice massage.
},
{
    491.0,494.0
     I like ice massage because it's very direct.
},
{
    494.0,499.0
     There's no real need to ice down the whole leg with a big ice pack.
},
{
    499.0,504.0
     So I like to use an ice massage because you can just work on that one spot right there
},
{
    504.0,505.52
     for about four or five minutes
},
{
    506.12,510.64
     Locally decrease the pain ice is not a big anti-inflammatory. It's a pain reliever
},
{
    510.64,513.52
     So if you're having a lot of discomfort, this is a great way to do it
},
{
    513.52,518.24
     Basically take a Dixie cup put it in the freezer fill it three quarters of the way with water
},
{
    518.48,523.92
     Let it freeze and then you can tear the top off and then utilize that these are nice little fancy cups that we use
},
{
    524.52,525.0
     Because you can hold on to the plastic and not freeze utilize that. These are nice little fancy cups that we use because
},
{
    525.0,529.64
     you can hold onto the plastic and not freeze your fingers while you are doing it. There
},
{
    529.64,535.44
     are other topical anti-inflammatories like Voltaren that you can use that you can rub
},
{
    535.44,540.72
     on that area. They're quite effective for that because the OJ goods is real close to
},
{
    540.72,549.52
     the skin and there's not a lot of soft tissue, not a lot of muscle, not a lot of fat in that area, so it can get pretty well absorbed. So those are
},
{
    549.52,555.32
     different things you can do to help yourself at home. Now if this becomes so
},
{
    555.32,558.84
     bad that you just can't take the pain, you really should be seeing an orthopedic
},
{
    558.84,563.4
     specialist for this, getting some x-rays. Some people will develop some bony
},
{
    563.4,567.04
     fragments and pieces that will come up
},
{
    567.04,573.76
     into the tendon and can be very very uncomfortable even just to walk and go up and downstairs and
},
{
    573.76,580.16
     to do light squatting activities. So I hope that I was able to give you lots of information so that
},
{
    580.16,586.04
     you can help yourself at home and understand Oshkosh Slotter is a little bit better. I hope that you can help yourself at home and understand Oshkosh slaughters a little bit better.
