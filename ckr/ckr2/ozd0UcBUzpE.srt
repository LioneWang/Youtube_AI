     Hi, I'm Dr. Adam Fields. You've rolled out your iliotibial bands and now we're
},
{
    4.76,8.64
     going to do some strengthening. Let's go ahead and bring your foam roller under
},
{
    8.64,14.88
     your knees, feet about hip distance apart. I want you to straighten your right leg
},
{
    14.88,19.44
     as hard as you can. Just straighten it, straighten it, straighten it. Toes back
},
{
    19.44,24.6
     towards you. We're going to hold this for 30 seconds as hard as you possibly can.
},
{
    24.6,25.28
     Now I want you to push your leg down a little bit into the foam roller as We're going to hold this for 30 seconds as hard as you possibly can.
},
{
    25.28,31.6
     Now I want you to push your leg down a little bit into the foam roller as that leg is totally
},
{
    31.6,32.68
     engaged.
},
{
    32.68,38.16
     It has to be contracted as hard as you can to get the actual point of this exercise.
},
{
    38.16,41.92
     The glute is going to be engaged a little bit because your leg is pushing down into
},
{
    41.92,42.92
     that foam roller.
},
{
    42.92,43.92
     Good.
},
{
    43.92,46.48
     Just push it hard, hard, hard, hard, hard.
},
{
    46.48,48.76
     Good, now let's go ahead and switch to the other side.
},
{
    48.76,51.22
     Straighten your left leg as hard as you can.
},
{
    51.22,53.66
     Push your leg down into that foam roller.
},
{
    53.66,58.24
     Engage the adductor, the inner thigh just a little bit.
},
{
    58.24,60.56
     So it's like everything's engaging here, right?
},
{
    60.56,63.32
     This is just all engagement.
},
{
    63.32,68.58
     It's that last five degrees of the range of motion that we really want to be working here. That end, this is an
},
{
    68.58,72.62
     isometric contraction. You won't hurt yourself if it does hurt. If you feel any
},
{
    72.62,76.18
     pain, just stop. But I think you're gonna be fine here. Let's go to the other side
},
{
    76.18,80.62
     and let's go ahead and straighten the leg as hard as you can. And we're gonna do
},
{
    80.62,88.22
     some circles with the ankle, but still keep that leg straight. So circle, beautiful, straighten that leg as hard as you can.
},
{
    90.38,94.06
     Do not let that straightening let up. You're doing great.
},
{
    94.06,96.9
     Let's go ahead the other direction. Beautiful.
},
{
    100.62,104.38
     Woo, feeling it. Good.
},
{
    104.38,106.24
     Let's go with the other leg.
},
{
    106.24,109.82
     Straighten it as hard as you can and circles.
},
{
    109.82,113.82
     Circles.
},
{
    113.82,121.16
     It's keeping that coordination going while you're engaging the leg.
},
{
    121.16,123.18
     Let's go the other direction now.
},
{
    123.18,127.2
     Hard as you can.
},
{
    127.2,131.28
     Pull the shoulders down, chest is up, big breaths.
},
{
    131.28,132.76
     Good.
},
{
    132.76,136.12
     Beautiful.
},
{
    136.12,138.56
     And let's straighten the right leg again.
},
{
    138.56,142.64
     And this time we're going to point to the end range motion so you feel the calf engage,
},
{
    142.64,144.56
     but your leg is totally straight.
},
{
    144.56,149.6
     And then extend and bring the toe up towards your head. Good. Now toes pointed
},
{
    151.36,160.4
     and back. That leg is so... it's like a board really and back towards you. Beautiful. You're doing great.
},
{
    169.64,172.44
     great. And let's switch to the other side. Straighten as hard as you can. I want you to be straightening so hard that you're at and keep pointing and
},
{
    172.44,177.6
     extending the foot that you're just shaking. I want you to shake like a
},
{
    177.6,182.76
     leaf, right? Just go for it. Engage the inner thigh a little bit so you're almost
},
{
    182.76,187.48
     like you're sliding your leg towards the other leg and pointing
},
{
    187.48,189.72
     and bringing it back towards you.
},
{
    189.72,192.84
     Pointing back towards you.
},
{
    192.84,193.68
     Beautiful.
},
{
    194.64,195.88
     Chest is up.
},
{
    195.88,197.36
     Okay, let's take the foam roller out
},
{
    197.36,198.84
     and put it to your side.
},
{
    198.84,202.84
     And we're gonna just stretch your hamstrings.
},
{
    202.84,208.22
     We're gonna stretch and we're gonna pulse, okay, I want you to pull above or below the knee.
},
{
    208.22,211.72
     We're going to go to the other side and push that low back into the ground
},
{
    211.72,215.56
     and we're just going to stretch the hamstrings. It's kind of an active stretch.
},
{
    215.56,219.24
     Engage the abs. Your head is off the mat. Beautiful.
},
{
    219.24,222.36
     Push that low back into the ground as hard as you can.
},
{
    222.36,225.42
     Don't want to arch that low back here. Good as hard as you can. Don't wanna arch that low back here.
},
{
    225.42,226.88
     Good job.
},
{
    226.88,228.5
     Keep going.
},
{
    228.5,229.34
     Beautiful.
},
{
    232.12,233.7
     Breathing out as you pull.
},
{
    233.7,234.54
     Fuh.
},
{
    234.54,235.38
     Fuh.
},
{
    235.38,236.22
     Fuh.
},
{
    236.22,237.06
     Fuh.
},
{
    237.06,237.9
     Fuh.
},
{
    237.9,238.74
     Fuh.
},
{
    238.74,239.72
     Sh, sh, sh.
},
{
    242.9,243.74
     Good.
},
{
    247.48,252.86
     Okay, we're gonna do a little bridge. I want you to pull those heels as close as you can toward your butt.
},
{
    252.86,254.78
     Arch your low back a little bit.
},
{
    254.78,257.74
     Now, with this, it's nice.
},
{
    257.74,259.0
     You protect the knees a little bit.
},
{
    259.0,266.0
     If you squeeze the foam roller in between your knees, lift the toes and lift those that hit those hips
},
{
    266.0,270.02
     off the ground and feel your glutes. Are they rock hard? Yes, great. Are the
},
{
    270.02,275.48
     hamstrings relaxed? Great. So let's do a couple pulses here.
},
{
    277.16,284.72
     Pulse it. Push the legs straight down into the ground. Like your tibia are
},
{
    284.72,285.74
     just vertical and they're going directly into the ground. Like your tibia are just vertical and they're
},
{
    285.74,290.98
     going directly into the ground and the hips are coming up. Beautiful. Squeeze
},
{
    290.98,309.34
     that roller, squeeze it, squeeze it. Good.
},
{
    309.34,311.44
     Put the roller down.
},
{
    311.44,315.44
     Straighten your right leg and let it flare out a little bit.
},
{
    315.44,318.2
     And now I want you to straighten that leg as hard as you can and we're going to bring
},
{
    318.2,323.68
     it up and twist it so that when you get to the knee, the toe is pointed pretty much straight
},
{
    323.68,324.68
     up.
},
{
    324.68,327.64
     So then you bring it out like a windshield wiper and back up.
},
{
    327.64,329.04
     Engage the abs.
},
{
    329.04,332.64
     Don't let them let up.
},
{
    332.64,336.88
     We're going to be feeling this hopefully, Vastus Medialis Oblicus right there, that
},
{
    336.88,339.0
     lower muscle.
},
{
    339.0,341.56
     And you're in a thigh a bit, but if you straighten it as hard as you can, you're going to be
},
{
    341.56,346.36
     more VMO.
},
{
    346.36,347.36
     There you go.
},
{
    347.36,350.4
     Toe back towards you.
},
{
    350.4,354.36
     This should be challenging.
},
{
    354.36,357.96
     And then set your leg down close to the hips.
},
{
    357.96,362.0
     And then we're going to straighten the other leg and we're going to lift it and bring it
},
{
    362.0,363.7
     up to meet the knee.
},
{
    363.7,366.24
     Not above the knee, just to the knee.
},
{
    366.24,367.36
     Great.
},
{
    371.36,374.6
     This is solid knee rehabilitation stuff.
},
{
    374.6,379.64
     Great prep if you want to do squats or something intense, even if you don't have a knee problem.
},
{
    379.64,382.12
     This is great warmup.
},
{
    382.12,384.36
     Really get your knee tracking right.
},
{
    384.36,385.72
     Get the proper muscles engaging,
},
{
    385.72,392.36
     getting that patella tracking properly, and really getting your knee on track.
},
{
    392.36,399.28
     Here we go. Straighten that leg as hard as you can. Windshield wiper that leg.
},
{
    401.12,407.92
     Okay, we're gonna do the bridges again. Heels really close to the butt.
},
{
    407.92,410.84
     Roller in between the knees and lift.
},
{
    410.84,412.92
     Okay, this time we're going to do isometric contraction.
},
{
    412.92,416.48
     You're going to squeeze that roller as hard as you can.
},
{
    416.48,420.2
     And what we're going to do is you're going to lift your right leg and push down with
},
{
    420.2,421.2
     your left leg.
},
{
    421.2,429.68
     Now, before we do it, I want to tell you, if this is too much, just go back to this position, keeping the hips up. Don't drop your hips at all the entire. We're going to go
},
{
    430.72,437.12
     a minute and a half. Okay, so go ahead and just lift. Chest is up. Arch the low back.
},
{
    440.48,449.64
     Good. Straighten the leg that's up and push down with the leg that's bent.
},
{
    449.64,452.56
     Feel that hamstring should be relaxed.
},
{
    452.56,455.68
     All the weight should be going right into the glute.
},
{
    455.68,456.92
     You should be shaking a little bit.
},
{
    456.92,458.36
     This is a little bit of a challenge.
},
{
    458.36,471.48
     Arch that low back, push your scapula into the ground. Straighten the non-leg on the ground. Push those hips up
},
{
    471.48,486.56
     towards the ceiling. Okay, we're going to go ahead and switch and straighten the opposite leg. Chest is up.
},
{
    486.56,491.88
     How we doing?
},
{
    491.88,496.6
     Arch that low back.
},
{
    496.6,499.68
     Squeeze the knees together.
},
{
    499.68,501.12
     Chest is up.
},
{
    501.12,509.8
     Lift those hips up towards the ceiling.
},
{
    509.8,513.92
     Focus, straighten the leg as hard as you can and push the other leg straight down into
},
{
    513.92,514.92
     the ground.
},
{
    514.92,519.32
     10 more seconds, you're doing great.
},
{
    519.32,531.88
     Big breath. I'm going to go ahead and just put the roller aside and we're going to do some lifts again.
},
{
    531.88,533.46
     This time the leg straight.
},
{
    533.46,537.52
     So the foot is going to be going straight up to the ceiling and down again.
},
{
    537.52,540.52
     The leg completely contracted.
},
{
    540.52,543.04
     Contract that leg and lift.
},
{
    543.04,546.64
     Keep the low back pushed into the ground. Your foot
},
{
    546.64,551.88
     might want to flare as you go down to the bottom, but keep it centered and
},
{
    551.88,555.88
     straighten the leg as hard as you can. I say that so much on this, but it's so
},
{
    555.88,559.44
     important because we want to work more your leg than we do your hip flexor on
},
{
    559.44,572.44
     this. Five more.
},
{
    572.44,576.56
     Or if you need to rest, now rest.
},
{
    576.56,584.12
     Either do them perfect or don't do them.
},
{
    584.12,586.64
     And plant that foot.
},
{
    586.64,590.0
     Let's go to the other side and lift.
},
{
    590.0,608.7
     Beautiful. Straighten that leg.
},
{
    608.7,611.48
     Every rep, remind it straighter.
},
{
    611.48,612.48
     Four more.
},
{
    612.48,613.48
     One.
},
{
    613.48,614.48
     Good job.
},
{
    614.48,615.48
     Two.
},
{
    615.48,616.48
     Three.
},
{
    616.48,617.48
     One more.
},
{
    617.48,618.48
     Four.
},
{
    618.48,619.48
     Good.
},
{
    619.48,626.4
     Let's go ahead and do another bridge.
},
{
    626.4,632.8
     Hips real close to your heels. Lift up. We're going to do that single leg bridge again.
},
{
    632.8,638.52
     Lift the right leg. Chest is up. Pushing down with the left leg. Straighten the right leg.
},
{
    638.52,646.3
     Good. You can do hands up. Get a little bit more out of it. Arch up onto your shoulders.
},
{
    646.3,648.72
     Good, straighten that right leg.
},
{
    648.72,650.4
     Push that left leg down.
},
{
    655.0,656.36
     Push, push, push, push.
},
{
    656.36,659.0
     You're gonna be shaking right now, that's a good thing.
},
{
    675.32,681.76
     10 seconds. And let's go ahead and drop that foot, lift the other, and push up.
},
{
    681.76,687.92
     Proud posture, chest is up, shoulders down, arms are straight, everything.
},
{
    687.92,691.16
     You're like a stiff soldier doing it.
},
{
    691.16,694.8
     Navy SEALs right here, pushing through it,
},
{
    694.8,696.68
     never giving up.
},
{
    696.68,698.4
     Feel that, re-engage that glute.
},
{
    698.4,700.08
     Get acquainted with that glute.
},
{
    700.08,701.2
     Learn what it does.
},
{
    701.2,703.0
     Learn how to make it work for you.
},
{
    703.0,706.16
     Push down into the ground with that heel hard.
},
{
    706.8,707.36
     There you go.
},
{
    711.84,715.04
     Straighten the left leg. Beautiful.
},
{
    717.6,722.08
     Okay, we're going to go on our side. Okay, go on your side. Face me.
},
{
    722.08,726.08
     Okay, go on your side, face me.
},
{
    730.08,730.88
     Top leg is going to go here or here, okay?
},
{
    737.6,738.96
     Bottom leg is just going to straighten and lift and hold and down, lift and hold,
},
{
    746.0,748.0
     lift and hold, good, lift and hold. Again, you're working that VMO. Lift and hold. Good job. Woo!
},
{
    750.0,752.0
     It's a good one.
},
{
    755.0,757.0
     Okay, and pulses now at the top.
},
{
    758.0,771.82
     40 of them. Good.
},
{
    771.82,775.86
     And let's bring your legs together 90 degrees and we're going to do some clams.
},
{
    775.86,780.56
     So stack the hips, open up the legs and squeeze at the top.
},
{
    780.56,782.9
     Open up the legs, squeeze at the top.
},
{
    782.9,783.9
     Good.
},
{
    783.9,787.0
     Open, squeeze. Engage the abs. Get your body used to engaging your abs.
},
{
    788.22,790.22
     Perfect.
},
{
    805.0,808.96
     One more. Good.
},
{
    808.96,811.4
     Let's do those inner thighs again.
},
{
    811.4,813.8
     And let's lift and hold.
},
{
    813.8,815.44
     And down, lift, hold.
},
{
    815.44,817.24
     Even get a little internal external rotation.
},
{
    817.24,821.36
     So you bring it down externally, rotate your leg a little bit and internally rotate it
},
{
    821.36,856.0

{
    982.48,984.9
     Have the best glutes in town.
},
{
    984.9,985.12
     Work your glutes in town.
},
{
    985.12,987.76
     Work your glutes.
},
{
    987.76,991.68
     The glutes are your friend.
},
{
    991.68,995.6
     Two more.
},
{
    995.6,996.84
     Push it and hold at the end.

{
    996.84,997.84
     Good.
},
{
    997.84,998.84
     One more.
},
{
    998.84,999.84
     Push it, hold at the end.
},
{
    999.84,1001.12
     Let's go in with the high again.
},
{
    1001.12,1002.12
     Let's go.
},
{
    1002.12,1004.6
     Lift it up and hold.
},
{
    1004.6,1006.28
     Rotate out, rotate in.

    1039.8,1042.2
     Oh, that's good. Now we're gonna do side lifts.
},
{
    1042.2,1044.8
     And we're just gonna do toe pointed straight ahead
},
{
    1044.8,1048.4
     and lift and hold and bring it down.
},
{
    1048.4,1049.84
     Lift and hold, bring it down.

},
{

{
    1084.0,1087.0

},
{
    1087.0,1093.84
     Okay, internal.
},
{
    1093.84,1096.92
     Again, let's work those inner thighs and that VMO.
},
{
    1096.92,1101.04
     Put that foot down, straighten that leg, and lift and hold.
},
{
    1101.04,1102.04
     And down.
},
{
    1102.04,1103.04
     Lift and hold.
},
{
    1103.04,1104.04
     Down.
},
{
    1104.04,1106.4
     Straighten the legs as hard you can.
},
{
    1106.4,1113.32
     Breathing out on the way up, squeeze it. That tear drop muscle, visualize it in
},
{
    1113.32,1118.88
     your head. See it, see it fibrous, see it big, see it working for you. See it going
},
{
    1118.88,1122.84
     down the ski slopes, see it on your mountain bike, see it absolutely
},
{
    1122.84,1143.6
     functioning big time as you straighten that leg as hard as you can and now pulse. Good job. Okay, let's go ahead and stretch your
},
{
    1143.6,1147.6
     hamstring a little bit.
},
{
    1147.6,1151.76
     Just pull that hamstring and we're just going to bring the toe back towards you.
},
{
    1151.76,1152.76
     Good.
},
{
    1152.76,1154.46
     Just feel that stretch.
},
{
    1154.46,1162.56
     Just really pull it, point the toe, bring it back towards you, point it back towards
},
{
    1162.56,1163.56
     you.
},
{
    1163.56,1164.56
     Keep going.
},
{
    1164.56,1169.08
     Pull it into your body.
},
{
    1169.08,1174.24
     Good.
},
{
    1174.24,1177.48
     Cross that leg over the other knee.
},
{
    1177.48,1183.0
     Reach your hand through in between your legs and to the outside of your leg and just pull
},
{
    1183.0,1184.0
     that in.
},
{
    1184.0,1186.44
     Let's stretch that outer hip that we worked so well.
},
{
    1186.44,1187.28
     Good.
},
{
    1189.36,1190.64
     Oh, that feels good, doesn't it?
},
{
    1190.64,1192.24
     It's a deep hip stretch.
},
{
    1192.24,1194.28
     You could even take your knee and push it up
},
{
    1194.28,1196.44
     towards your chest and get it even further.
},
{
    1198.28,1201.2
     Okay, let's stretch the opposite hamstring.
},
{
    1201.2,1203.56
     Bring it up, pull it in.
},
{
    1203.56,1204.88
     Good.
},
{
    1204.88,1208.32
     Let's bring the toes back towards you and point them.
},
{
    1208.32,1209.96
     Ooh, feel that nice stretch.
},
{
    1209.96,1212.84
     A little crack in the ankle perhaps,
},
{
    1212.84,1214.68
     and bring it back towards you.
},
{
    1214.68,1215.52
     Beautiful.
},
{
    1217.64,1219.12
     Working it.
},
{
    1219.12,1221.32
     You did a great job today.
},
{
    1221.32,1223.16
     Keep doing these.
},
{
    1223.16,1227.64
     Your knees are gonna be loving it.
},
{
    1227.64,1241.36
     Let's go ahead and cross it over.
},
{
    1241.36,1252.36
     Big breath as you breathe out, pull a little harder.
},
{
    1252.36,1306.48
     Let's stretch the outside of those legs. ʕᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗᵗ Opposite side and take that hand to the opposite side of the knee, bend it, turn
},
{
    1306.48,1311.76
     the other way and just pull that knee in and really give that outer leg that low
},
{
    1311.76,1318.28
     back everything a stretch. Oftentimes with the knees the outer can get a
},
{
    1318.28,1323.2
     little weaker or they can get a little too tight. Usually it's too tight and the
},
{
    1323.2,1326.32
     legs go out so we need to strengthen the inner thighs
},
{
    1327.04,1331.28
     so we're stretching the outers a little bit more. Good breathe through that.
},
{
    1335.68,1340.72
     Great job. While we're doing shockwave or rehab together I want you to do in these exercises
},
{
    1340.72,1349.16
     every day and then we're going to get more complex movements. Thanks for being here today for your strong knees.
