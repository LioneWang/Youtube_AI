     Hi everybody, it's Donna from Berkeley Life Nitric Oxide and I'm going to show
},
{
    4.76,9.24
     you how easy it is to test your patients with our test strips. So what you're
},
{
    9.24,13.4
     going to do is take these test strips and test without having had food or water
},
{
    13.4,19.2
     for about 15 minutes. You're going to pull it long direction and the test strip
},
{
    19.2,23.76
     is going to come right out very easily and on the test strip you're going to see
},
{
    23.76,29.52
     something that says saliva here. So there's a pad on the end. You're going to place this on your tongue
},
{
    29.52,33.24
     for five to ten seconds.
},
{
    35.12,38.88
     And then you make sure it's got a lot of saliva on it. You're going to squeeze
},
{
    38.88,43.4
     that right in half and hold the pads together and just give it a little
},
{
    43.4,45.16
     pressure. And then you're
},
{
    45.16,49.56
     simply going to release it and you're going to see your test results. Now mine
},
{
    49.56,54.0
     came out a nice dark shade of pink which doesn't surprise me because I have been
},
{
    54.0,58.6
     on the product for about 30 days. I just took my capsules this morning and I'm
},
{
    58.6,63.6
     testing about 90 minutes afterwards. If your patients do not test well and
},
{
    63.6,66.04
     their colors are really light, you can
},
{
    66.04,69.84
     tell people's levels by this chart that we give you on a tent card that we send you in
},
{
    69.84,75.12
     your first order. You can put this on your table in your waiting room. It's a nice scale
},
{
    75.12,81.76
     that shows high to low. So the darker the pink, the better the nitric oxide quantity
},
{
    81.76,85.56
     in your saliva. So mine's a nice dark shade of pink. If your patient
},
{
    85.56,89.4
     tests low that's totally okay. That's just showing them that their levels are
},
{
    89.4,93.64
     low. So you're going to retest them doing the exact same thing about 90 minutes
},
{
    93.64,98.24
     after taking just two capsules. So to have them even they can even do it in
},
{
    98.24,102.44
     your office. Take two capsules and test 90 minutes later and that should give
},
{
    102.44,109.56
     them a really nice result. If you have any questions please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I'm here for you. My phone
},
{
    109.56,116.84
     number is 310-505-3896 and you can also email me at Donna at BerkeleyLife.com.

{
    116.84,120.8
     I look forward to working with you.
