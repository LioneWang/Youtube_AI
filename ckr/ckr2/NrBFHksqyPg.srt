     Hi I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist, Brad Heideck physical therapist, I thought for a minute you were going to do it like silently
},
{
    7.0,13.0
     and together we are the most famous physical therapists on the internet, and our opinion of course, our opinion
},
{
    13.0,17.0
     Brad we're going to talk about something near and dear to you, you bet, unfortunately it's near to you
},
{
    17.0,27.0
     we're going to talk about spinal stenosis and we're going to talk about three ways you can maybe tell that you have spinal stenosis and this is more kind of a back pain issue, back pain and leg pain issue
},
{
    27.0,33.0
     Sure, yep, low back usually, could be in the neck too but we're not focused on here today
},
{
    33.0,39.0
     Exactly, this is all about the back, not the low back, not the neck, because you can get stenosis anywhere
},
{
    39.0,41.0
     First off, oh you know what, we need the spine
},
{
    41.0,44.0
     Oh, yeah, Nancy, be careful
},
{
    44.0,47.84
     I know, I'm gonna rotate. Keep it vertical. Go ahead.
},
{
    47.84,62.44
     Alright, each one of these segments here have basically on the back of it an open area like
},
{
    62.44,68.94
     a tunnel. Is that a good way to say it Brad? Right, where the spinal nerve exit from the spinal cord and they have to go
},
{
    68.94,75.1
     through the two vertebrae and that area that hole is called a...
},
{
    75.1,76.1
     Foramen.
},
{
    76.1,77.1
     Foramen, yes.
},
{
    77.1,81.5
     We'll talk about more central spinal stenosis, the one going down the main canal.
},
{
    81.5,83.5
     Let me show it on here.
},
{
    83.5,85.52
     Okay, so this is kind of a cross-section through one of the vertebrae and you can going down the main canal. Let me show it on here. All right. Okay.
},
{
    86.96,89.52
     So this is kind of a cross section through one of the vertebrae.
},
{
    89.52,92.32
     And you can see this round hole here.
},
{
    92.32,95.76
     All right, the spinal cord goes right down that hole.
},
{
    95.76,97.64
     This is a person who has spinal stenosis
},
{
    97.64,100.68
     and as you can see it's narrowed up.
},
{
    100.68,103.8
     And this can be caused by a thickening of the ligaments.
},
{
    103.8,107.0
     It could be caused by a thickening of the ligaments, it could be caused by a bony growth,
},
{
    107.0,115.0
     there's other things that can cause it, a disc protrusion into the canal also cause it.
},
{
    115.0,118.0
     But anyway, so there's pressure on the spinal cord.
},
{
    118.0,122.0
     And when you get to the low back, actually what is happening at that point,
},
{
    122.0,126.0
     it's really not the spinal cord anymore, it's the cauda equina,
},
{
    126.0,131.6
     which is what the actually is Latin for horse's tail. Right, yep. So and that's just the spinal
},
{
    131.6,137.28
     nerves that are starting to spread out. Okay, so it's right, if you look up here, it's kind of like
},
{
    137.28,142.32
     a garden hose I imagine it, and once you get down to L1 here, it starts to turn into that
},
{
    142.32,145.66
     cauda equina, in other words it turns into a number of like spaghetti
},
{
    145.66,150.76
     You have like a number of spaghetti strands going down and then they'll exit out the
},
{
    151.88,153.88
     Framen here
},
{
    155.44,158.88
     So that's enough about anatomy what are you gonna feel if you have spinal sconosis?
},
{
    158.88,162.64
     Brad you apparently have some spinal sconosis you can tell
},
{
    162.64,167.84
     Well, yeah, I think yeah, I'm not really sure yet, I've got to get some more scans done
},
{
    167.84,172.52
     whether it's through the spinal cord or the stenosis through the frame itself
},
{
    172.52,178.72
     But one thing that definitely is no fun is standing in one spot for a long period of time
},
{
    178.72,184.52
     like shopping. If I go shopping, my wife is shopping and I'm waiting, I need to sell
},
{
    184.52,186.72
     Another reason not to like shopping for a month.
},
{
    186.72,190.88
     But, and I saw statistically that was the highest
},
{
    190.88,193.68
     correlated fine with spinal stenosis,
},
{
    193.68,195.44
     that they don't like standing.
},
{
    195.44,198.12
     And it was actually called the shopping cart test,
},
{
    198.12,199.52
     or shopping cart syndrome.
},
{
    199.52,202.04
     Because people would tell me and say,
},
{
    202.04,204.0
     it feels better when you lean forward
},
{
    204.0,205.36
     and hold onto the shopping cart. Right, take feels better when you lean forward and hold on to the
},
{
    205.36,209.4
     shopping cart. Right, take some weight off lean forward and right now I mean
},
{
    209.4,212.84
     because I'm having some back pain now this feels good and I'm doing the
},
{
    212.84,216.88
     opposite of what we talked about right. I'm actually mounting my back and
},
{
    216.88,220.52
     separating it gives a little more space and this is the one case where you're
},
{
    220.52,225.9
     gonna want to be able to do that And usually it's the opposite with normal back pain.
},
{
    225.9,232.54
     Normal back pain generally feels better standing and walking, generally not always, and worse with sitting,
},
{
    232.54,238.94
     this feels better with sitting. You better leave it. Okay, you also get numbness, tingling and pain down into the legs.
},
{
    238.94,245.88
     And quite often what I see is often it's in both legs and that's also not typical back pain
},
{
    245.88,252.08
     typical back pain tends to go down one side so if you're getting it down both legs it more often is
},
{
    252.08,258.12
     going to be a spinal stenosis or again not you know definitive right the last thing Brad is
},
{
    258.12,262.76
     extension hurts right right you want to show them what extension that's what we're gonna have been
},
{
    262.76,266.74
     backwards like this and I can do this and this isn't too bad
},
{
    266.86,271.34
     But if you're doing something like overhead like over the weekend, I was working on the ceiling
},
{
    271.64,274.54
     The next two days were great fun. You're not feeling it. Yeah
},
{
    275.2,279.5
     So that's that's really the three the three symptoms, right?
},
{
    279.5,284.32
     And then I think we'll save for another video for exercises and treatment
},
{
    284.32,286.44
     We're actually going to do that next video, Brad.
},
{
    286.44,287.64
     Absolutely, so.
},
{
    287.64,288.48
     Oh, cute.
},
{
    288.48,289.32
     Yeah, I'm just,
},
{
    289.32,290.56
     Nancy, maybe you could even put a link
},
{
    290.56,292.28
     to that video from this one.
},
{
    292.28,293.76
     Yeah, link it right up, Nancy.
},
{
    293.76,294.6
     Put it together.
},
{
    294.6,296.16
     Oh, by the way, just real quickly.
},
{
    296.16,298.36
     Spinal stenosis tends to happen, by the way,
},
{
    298.36,300.84
     in people very commonly 60 and over.
},
{
    300.84,302.76
     Brad unfortunately got it early.
},
{
    302.76,305.4
     But so if you're in that age 40 and over
},
{
    305.4,308.68
     you're gonna subscribe to us because we do provide videos on a stay healthy fit
},
{
    308.68,332.92
     and pain for you well into your elderly years. You can deal with these things like spinal stenosis. Thank you.
