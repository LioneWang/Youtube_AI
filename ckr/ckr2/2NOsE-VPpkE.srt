     Hey everybody, it's Doctor Jo.
},
{
    15.52,17.22
     I've got another helper with me today.
},
{
    17.22,18.22
     This is Molly.
},
{
    18.22,23.2
     She'll be observing and making sure that I do everything correctly with good technique.
},
{
    23.2,26.46
     So what we're going to be talking about today is our neck stretches.
},
{
    26.46,29.32
     Now the neck can be very tricky
},
{
    29.32,32.54
     and it can have serious, serious injuries to it.
},
{
    32.54,36.46
     So it is key to go to your doctor or your physical therapist
},
{
    36.46,40.12
     and get a correct diagnosis and get imaging that you need.
},
{
    40.12,42.72
     So this is really just some gentle stretches
},
{
    42.72,44.84
     to get you going if your neck just is stiff
},
{
    44.84,45.96
     or maybe you slept on it wrong. So the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna start off really just some gentle stretches to get you going if your neck just a stiff or maybe you slept on it wrong
},
{
    46.18,49.56
     So the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna start off with just some gentle
},
{
    49.96,52.6
     Stretches not even using your hands, but just with your neck
},
{
    52.6,58.08
     So the first thing I'm gonna have you do to start off is just bring your chin down to your chest
},
{
    59.32,60.2
     and
},
{
    60.2,65.94
     Then hold it just for about five to ten seconds and then look back up towards the ceiling
},
{
    66.0,69.06
     Same thing just for about five to ten seconds now
},
{
    69.06,71.88
     You want to make sure that you're staying in a plane
},
{
    72.32,78.96
     Front to back that you're not turning your head. This is really in a straight plane bringing that chin down to your chest
},
{
    78.96,80.96
     And then bringing it back
},
{
    82.48,86.0
     Good now then the next one what you want to do is you want to take your
},
{
    86.0,91.28
     ear to the side. Now this is another key. You just want to gently bring it to the side. You don't
},
{
    91.28,95.36
     want to bring your shoulder up. You're not actually touching your ear to your shoulder. Your shoulder
},
{
    95.36,100.88
     staying in one spot. You're just bringing it over. Same thing now. It's in a plane this way. So you
},
{
    100.88,105.12
     want to keep it in that plane. You're going to stretch about five to ten seconds,
},
{
    108.96,110.24
     and then you're going to come back the other way. Stretch five to ten seconds.
},
{
    114.48,115.52
     Good. So you're going to do that about three to five times in each direction.
},
{
    118.48,123.2
     Good. And once that gets a little bit loosened up, now what you're going to do is you're going to rotate a little bit. So you're just going to now turn almost like you're looking over your shoulder.
},
{
    124.48,131.76
     Same thing, about five, ten seconds seconds and then turn back the other way.
},
{
    131.76,133.32
     Very good and then stretching it out.
},
{
    133.32,137.6
     So those are just starting off with some simple stretches without doing anything except moving
},
{
    137.6,140.2
     your head and getting those stretches in there.
},
{
    140.2,145.0
     Front to back, side to side, turn to turn.
},
{
    145.64,148.2
     Molly's embarrassing me, but that's okay.
},
{
    148.2,149.64
     So the next thing that we're gonna do
},
{
    149.64,151.52
     is we're gonna add some over pressure.
},
{
    151.52,153.32
     And basically what over pressure is,
},
{
    153.32,155.44
     is you just use your hand
},
{
    155.44,157.64
     to give you a little more pressure added to the stretch.
},
{
    157.64,160.6
     So these stretches are actually gonna be our traditional
},
{
    161.56,166.62
     30 second stretches three times on each side. Now the key is for this one is
},
{
    166.62,172.66
     you're going to hold your hand underneath your leg. Now the key for this is it's
},
{
    172.66,175.48
     going to keep your shoulder flat and it's going to pull down a little bit so
},
{
    175.48,178.9
     you're already getting a little bit of a stretch. What you're going to do now is
},
{
    178.9,182.9
     you're just going to bring your hand on the top of your head and not on top of
},
{
    182.9,189.74
     your head right here but on top towards the opposite way and you're just going to pull over to the side. Straight
},
{
    189.74,193.62
     over you want it to go in that plane you're trying to take that ear towards
},
{
    193.62,197.94
     the opposite shoulder and you're just going to take some deep breaths breathing
},
{
    197.94,207.6
     and out. I might fall asleep and those 30 seconds three times each.
},
{
    207.6,208.6
     Both sides.
},
{
    208.6,210.4
     Make sure you're doing both sides so you keep everything even.
},
{
    210.4,216.48
     All right, so then the last one that I'm going to show you is our levator scapula stretch.
},
{
    216.48,221.4
     And that's the muscle that pulls your shoulder blades up, that scapula up.
},
{
    221.4,226.56
     And the key for that one is, last time people get hunched over a lot, they're typing on the computer,
},
{
    226.56,229.56
     and those muscles get really tight, and when those muscles get tight,
},
{
    229.56,233.96
     people tend to get tension headaches. So a really good way to stretch that out
},
{
    233.96,237.68
     is you're going to take one, the arm on the same side that it's hurting,
},
{
    237.68,240.6
     and you're going to put it up on your shoulder if you can.
},
{
    240.6,243.64
     And then what you're going to do is you're going to take your other hand
},
{
    243.64,247.68
     and put it kind of on the back of your head, and you're going to do is you're going to take your other hand and put it kind of on the back of your head and you're going to pull it towards your
},
{
    247.68,251.56
     opposite knee. So you're not pulling it straight down, you're not pulling it
},
{
    251.56,255.32
     towards the side, but towards your opposite knee almost like a 45 degree
},
{
    255.32,259.08
     angle. So you're going to hold it up as high as you can and you're going to pull
},
{
    259.08,263.4
     your head down. Nice stretch. Remember those stretches don't want to be painful.
},
{
    263.4,265.3
     You don't want to feel any pain in your neck
},
{
    265.32,268.04
     But you want to feel a nice stretch in there?
},
{
    268.76,270.76
     30 seconds
},
{
    270.94,272.76
     Three times each
},
{
    272.76,278.8
     Make sure you do both sides you want to get everything stretched out and that's just the simple stretches for your neck
},
{
    278.8,285.0
     Just to get everything loosened up and remember you can trust me, I'm a doctor.
},
