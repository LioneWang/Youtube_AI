     Hi everybody out there. I'm Dr. Joe Nemeth. I'm a periodontist in Southfield, Michigan.
},
{
    5.04,12.16
     I want to talk a little bit about bleeding gums today. Bleeding gums are never normal. It's never
},
{
    12.16,18.8
     normal to have bleeding gums. You think, well, everybody's gums bleed when they floss sometimes
},
{
    18.8,25.84
     or they blush sometimes. No, your gums shouldn't bleed. They only bleed if they're not
},
{
    25.84,31.16
     healthy. That means you have an infection or inflammation that's causing
},
{
    31.16,36.14
     those gums to bleed. So bleeding gums are never normal. Sometimes you can
},
{
    36.14,41.56
     improve them at home, which we can tell you a little bit more about. So gum
},
{
    41.56,45.06
     disease of course is the number one cause or periodontal disease
},
{
    45.06,49.5
     is the number one cause of bleeding gums. Now some people have certain
},
{
    49.5,54.98
     systemic diseases for instance leukemia. I've seen cases of leukemia where the
},
{
    54.98,65.84
     gums do tend to bleed much more easily. Certain kinds of cancers possibly might increase the tendency for bleeding gums.
},
{
    65.84,75.32
     But the main cause, 99 point, whatever percentage of the time, is infection in the gums that
},
{
    75.32,80.76
     you don't feel, that you don't see, that you don't even know is there, but causing a chronic
},
{
    80.76,86.2
     inflammation, the bleeding, the infection, which then leads to bone loss and
},
{
    86.2,92.24
     possibly eventually tooth loss as well as compromising your general health.
},
{
    92.24,93.88
     Bleeding gums have to be stopped.
},
{
    93.88,95.92
     Hello, my name is Amar Khatranji.
},
{
    95.92,98.48
     I'm a periodontist here in Southfield, Michigan.
},
{
    98.48,102.24
     Today I want to talk a little bit about bleeding gums and what you can do at home to help treat
},
{
    102.24,103.24
     them.
},
{
    103.24,107.56
     A lot of people ask, you know, I notice a lot more bleeding when I'm brushing and flossing. A lot of times
},
{
    107.56,111.52
     what you're seeing is more plaque is creating swelling around the gum tissue.
},
{
    111.52,115.66
     You really have to do a good job of removing the plaque in between your
},
{
    115.66,119.48
     teeth and especially the stuff that's between your gums. The first thing that
},
{
    119.48,123.0
     you have to do is you have to do a really good job at home with your home care.
},
{
    123.0,128.58
     So brushing and flossing is critical and doing it properly is critical to eliminating the
},
{
    128.58,131.66
     inflammation that causes the bleeding in your gums.
},
{
    131.66,136.58
     So good brushing habits, good flossing habits is the first place you can start.
},
{
    136.58,140.3
     Now you can also use stuff at home like salt and baking soda.
},
{
    140.3,144.78
     If you mix that up, you can either put a little bit of a concoction right on a toothbrush
},
{
    144.78,147.52
     and brush it around your teeth and your gums.
},
{
    147.52,151.08
     That can help reduce the swelling that you have around your gums.
},
{
    151.08,153.88
     That can also reduce the bleeding that you'll see.
},
{
    153.88,158.0
     Another thing that you can use is hydrogen peroxide and rinses with hydrogen peroxide.
},
{
    158.0,162.76
     What that does is it increases the amount of oxygen in your mouth and helps reduce the
},
{
    162.76,164.92
     overall swelling that you have.
},
{
    164.92,167.52
     So that's another option that you can do at home.
},
{
    167.52,171.76
     And finally, what we really like to see is if you continue to see these things coming
},
{
    171.76,175.64
     in and seeing a periodontist to help treat you professionally if you continue to see
},
{
    175.64,176.64
     the bleeding.
},
{
    176.64,183.2
     So, you may be able to treat your bleeding gums at home, that's possible, but sometimes
},
{
    183.2,187.4
     that can't be done or if you can't do it, we treat it here.
},
{
    187.4,188.4
     And how do we treat it?
},
{
    188.4,195.52
     Well, we take a slide, we take a sample from under your gum to see what organisms are there,
},
{
    195.52,200.44
     to see the parasites, to see the bacteria that are contributing or causing the bleeding
},
{
    200.44,201.64
     gums.
},
{
    201.64,203.64
     We then eliminate those.
},
{
    203.64,206.54
     Our treatment eliminates those bacteria. When
},
{
    206.54,212.76
     we eliminate those organisms, the gum bleeding, the inflammation stops, the bleeding stops.
},
{
    212.76,217.64
     Your mouth gets healthier and your body gets healthier. Because if I told you all of the
},
{
    217.64,225.0
     systemic diseases, the general diseases that are increased by having gum disease, you would be amazed.
},
{
    225.0,227.66
     I call it the other silent killer.
},
{
    227.66,231.14
     And the goal is to eliminate all bleeding.
},
{
    231.14,233.94
     If you can do it with your home care, great.
},
{
    233.94,236.34
     If not, that's what we do here.
},
{
    236.34,240.12
     Our goal is to eliminate all infection
},
{
    240.12,242.86
     and never have any bleeding gums,
},
{
    242.86,246.56
     which is a cardinal sign of gum disease.
},
{
    246.56,252.56
     So, have a healthy mouth, you'll have a healthier body, and have a great day.
