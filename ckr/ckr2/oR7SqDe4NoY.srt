     Wow, you've just hit your thumb with a hammer.

     My name is Beverly Bitterman, ARNP, Health and Wellness Consultant.

{
    8.84,12.88
     And I'm here to tell you a little bit about how you might deal with that.
},
{
    12.88,17.6
     So you can get an injury of a nail in several different ways.
},
{
    17.6,19.92
     Hitting your thumb with a hammer is classic.
},
{
    19.92,26.88
     You could shut your finger in a car door, for example, or shut it accidentally in a closet door.
},
{
    26.88,29.94
     All of those different ways essentially
},
{
    29.94,33.48
     cause a bruise underneath your nail.
},
{
    33.48,36.16
     And what will happen, and what will happen pretty rapidly,
},
{
    36.16,40.24
     is that you'll see a little bit of blood underneath your nail.
},
{
    40.24,43.6
     And your thumb or your finger will begin to throb.
},
{
    43.6,48.6
     Well, if you're in a circumstance where you could go visit your medical provider,
},
{
    48.6,54.6
     I would recommend that you do that because they would have equipment and strategies
},
{
    54.6,62.3
     to help drain that blood blister from your nail in a very sterile and safe environment.
},
{
    62.3,66.32
     But let's say that you are camping and you're not
},
{
    66.32,71.48
     going to be home till tomorrow or it's eight o'clock at night and you really
},
{
    71.48,77.46
     don't want to go to the emergency room. If you have to, if you can't get a
},
{
    77.46,83.0
     medical provider to treat you, here is a home remedy. And what you do is you take
},
{
    83.0,86.08
     a paper clip and undo it.
},
{
    86.08,87.92
     And then you clean it.
},
{
    87.92,91.96
     I would recommend that you clean it with soap and water, that you pour a little alcohol
},
{
    91.96,92.96
     on it.
},
{
    92.96,97.68
     The next thing that you want to do is you want to get the tip of it hot.
},
{
    97.68,110.04
     So you can hold it in a flame, like in a candle flame, until it gets kind of red. And then what you're going to do is you're going to apply pressure onto the nail with
},
{
    110.04,112.4
     the tip of this hot paper clip.
},
{
    112.4,120.28
     And what will happen is you'll basically bore a little hole into the nail and the blood
},
{
    120.28,126.84
     that's trapped in there will release and you'll have a fairly immediate relief
},
{
    126.84,128.44
     in terms of pain.
},
{
    128.44,134.88
     I would then bandage up that finger and make sure you treat it like a cut that you keep
},
{
    134.88,136.72
     it clean and dry.
},
{
    136.72,147.04
     And if you don't still feel well the next day, if you feel like there's more to come out etc. or if any signs of
},
{
    147.04,151.32
     infection occur then you'll want to make sure that you see your physician as soon
},
{
    151.32,158.64
     as possible. My name is Beverly Bitterman, ARNP Health and Wellness Consultant.
