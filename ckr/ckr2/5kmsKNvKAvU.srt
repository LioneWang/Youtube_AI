{
    0.0,6.72
     Alright, so now we're on the adult unconscious choking victim.
},
{
    6.72,10.08
     This is the person we were working with when they were conscious and choking.
},
{
    10.08,12.48
     Our efforts did not get the obstruction clear.
},
{
    12.48,16.4
     They were going unconscious, so we help lower them to ground ideally.
},
{
    16.4,20.48
     And as soon as they were lowered to the ground, that's our cue to access the emergency medical
},
{
    20.48,24.16
     services, call 911 or call a code.
},
{
    24.16,27.08
     At this point, once we lower them down to the ground
},
{
    27.08,29.68
     after calling 911, we're gonna go straight
},
{
    29.68,32.18
     to 30 chest compressions.
},
{
    32.18,34.62
     We're gonna do those 30 chest compressions
},
{
    34.62,36.44
     and then open the air wing.
},
{
    36.44,39.08
     Look in the mouth, check for an obstruction.
},
{
    39.08,42.68
     If we see the obstruction, we're actually going to reach in.
},
{
    42.68,44.46
     Now watch as we reach in here.
},
{
    44.46,49.88
     We're actually gonna go with a hooking motion with one finger to the side of the mouth, go towards
},
{
    49.88,55.24
     the back, grab that object, and pull it out. Once the object is out, we're going to go
},
{
    55.24,60.4
     ahead and cover the mouth and nose with a mask and attempt one breath. We attempt one
},
{
    60.4,66.44
     breath, it does not go in. We reposition the head, attempt another breath.
},
{
    66.44,69.04
     It still doesn't go in, so we go right back
},
{
    69.04,70.92
     to 30 chest compressions.
},
{
    70.92,74.18
     After 30 chest compressions, we put our mask back
},
{
    74.18,76.16
     on the face, attempt a breath.
},
{
    76.16,80.46
     If it doesn't go in, we reposition the head,
},
{
    80.46,82.02
     attempt another breath.
},
{
    82.02,84.4
     If it still doesn't go in, we go right back
},
{
    84.4,90.08
     to chest compressions. If at some point when we try the rescue breath and it goes in,
},
{
    90.08,95.6
     we're going to deliver a second rescue breath and then check for a carotid pulse,
},
{
    95.6,101.36
     no longer than 10 seconds. If we find that there is a good palpable or feelable
},
{
    101.36,105.6
     pulse, easily feelable, we know that this person is not in cardiac arrest
},
{
    105.72,111.56
     But if they're not breathing we're gonna begin rescue breathing if there's no pulse no breathing
},
{
    111.56,113.56
     We're gonna go right straight into CPR
},
{
    116.96,120.76
     So I just lowered him to the ground he was conscious and choking now he's unconscious
},
{
    121.64,125.08
     Now I'm gonna call 911. Hey you in the plaid shirt, go call 911.
},
{
    125.08,127.48
     I've got a person who's now unconscious from choking.
},
{
    127.48,128.08
     Please return.
},
{
    128.08,129.72
     Let me know that you've called him.
},
{
    129.72,132.76
     At this point, I'm going to start my 30 chest compressions.
},
{
    132.76,136.16
     One, two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven,
},
{
    136.16,142.6
     eight, and nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
},
{
    142.6,147.0
     22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.
},
{
    150.0,152.0
     I don't see anything in an attempt of breath.
},
{
    155.0,157.0
     Nothing went in. I'm going to reposition once.
},
{
    158.0,160.0
     Try another breath.
},
{
    162.0,165.0
     Nothing went in. I'm going to continue 30 more chest compressions.
},
{
    165.0,172.0
     Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen,
},
{
    172.0,176.0
     sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five,
},
{
    176.0,178.88
     twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty.
},
{
    178.88,179.88
     Look in the mouth.
},
{
    179.88,181.88
     I still don't see anything.
},
{
    181.88,183.88
     I try a breath.
},
{
    183.88,186.0
     Didn't go in. I'm going't see anything. I'll try a breath. Didn't go in.
},
{
    186.0,188.0
     I'm going to reposition.
},
{
    188.0,190.0
     Try again.
},
{
    192.0,194.0
     Nothing went in. I'm going to continue 30 chest compressions.
},
{
    194.0,196.0
     After 30 chest compressions,
},
{
    196.0,198.0
     if I tried a breath and it went in,
},
{
    198.0,200.0
     I'd give another breath,
},
{
    200.0,202.0
     check for a pulse.
},
{
    202.0,204.0
     If there was an easily palpable pulse,
},
{
    204.0,206.76
     but no breathing,
},
{
    206.76,211.28
     I'd continue rescue breathing. If there was no pulse and no breathing, I'd start CBR.
},
