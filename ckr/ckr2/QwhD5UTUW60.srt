     Bob and Brad, the two most famous physical therapists on the internet.
},
{
    9.5,11.2
     Hi, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.
},
{
    11.2,12.5
     Brad Heineck, physical therapist.
},
{
    12.5,14.5
     Because we are the most famous physical therapists on the internet.
},
{
    14.5,15.5
     In our opinion, of course.
},
{
    15.5,17.2
     We should have a race to see how fast we can say that.
},
{
    17.2,18.2
     Very good.
},
{
    18.2,23.2
     Okay, today we're going to talk about top three exercises for TMJ, temporal mandibular,
},
{
    23.2,24.5
     well disorders actually.
},
{
    24.5,25.76
     People call it TMJ and that's actually, TMJ is the joint.ular, well disorders actually, people call it TMJ
},
{
    25.76,28.24
     and that's actually, TMJ is the joint.
},
{
    28.24,29.4
     It's the name of the joint.
},
{
    29.4,31.72
     Yeah, and temporal mandibular disorders
},
{
    31.72,33.36
     are what happens to it.
},
{
    33.36,34.4
     If there's a problem.
},
{
    34.4,35.24
     Right, right.
},
{
    35.24,38.52
     So we just did a video on how to do a kind of a massage
},
{
    38.52,39.96
     to the muscles around the joint.
},
{
    39.96,42.6
     That's something to give you immediate relief.
},
{
    42.6,46.6
     Now if you're trying to correct this for the long haul,
},
{
    46.6,48.3
     then you don't want to do the exercises.
},
{
    48.3,49.9
     But don't do these exercises and think,
},
{
    49.9,51.9
     well, they didn't work, I don't feel any better.
},
{
    51.9,54.5
     They're gonna, it's gonna take a while for them to help.
},
{
    54.5,56.18
     Right, so.
},
{
    56.18,58.58
     A number of days or weeks.
},
{
    58.58,59.42
     Right.
},
{
    59.42,61.7
     For a muscle to contract and strengthen
},
{
    61.7,63.46
     and make the changes that are gonna help.
},
{
    63.46,64.3
     Right.
},
{
    64.3,66.48
     Now the joint itself is right here
},
{
    67.36,72.8
     if we pull it off here you can see. How we looking Lonnie?
},
{
    74.8,77.44
     Lonnie's not saying anything that's always bad when Lonnie's not saying anything.
},
{
    78.88,84.24
     That looks pretty good. Sure. All right and like I said we did the massage of the muscles around it
},
{
    84.24,85.76
     but now we're gonna do some exercise
},
{
    85.76,87.32
     to help strengthen that joint
},
{
    87.32,89.32
     and to help put it in the right position.
},
{
    89.32,90.16
     Sure.
},
{
    90.16,92.84
     Okay, so we're first gonna start off with Brad.
},
{
    92.84,95.04
     What you're gonna do is you're gonna,
},
{
    95.04,97.58
     the first exercise is you're gonna take your tongue,
},
{
    97.58,99.28
     and this is called the resting position.
},
{
    99.28,101.24
     It's the right position,
},
{
    101.24,102.96
     putting your jaw in the right position.
},
{
    102.96,104.4
     You can take your tongue and you put it out
},
{
    104.4,108.22
     and then roof of your mouth behind the front teeth. Alright, alright, yep.
},
{
    108.22,112.78
     Take a couple deep breaths.
},
{
    113.3,118.4
     With good posture by the way. Always good posture. Shoulders back up.
},
{
    118.4,121.84
     And then go ahead and open your mouth six times with the tongue in that place.
},
{
    121.84,129.2
     Okay, I'll do it from the profile. Okay we
},
{
    129.2,133.44
     don't need to do a six. I feel like a guppy. Yeah. All right that's the exercise
},
{
    133.44,136.56
     number one. The exercise number two is going to start strengthening the
},
{
    136.56,140.4
     stabilizing the muscles. Okay. So you take your two thumbs and put it underneath
},
{
    140.4,144.32
     your chin and you're going to push down like you're opening the jaw but you're
},
{
    144.32,145.32
     not letting the jaw open. You're going to push down like you're opening the jaw but you're not letting the jaw open
},
{
    145.44,151.48
     You're gonna push down. I mean the jaw is pushing down the thumbs are pushing up. Okay, so
},
{
    151.72,154.92
     So I'm going to try and go but right you're trying to go like yeah
},
{
    155.44,160.04
     So the jaw is going that way the fingers are pushing up so it's an isometric
},
{
    160.04,165.56
     Yep, six second hold six times and don't let your head come out like this. Good posture.
},
{
    165.56,166.56
     Good posture.
},
{
    166.56,171.68
     Okay, then you're going to put your hand on the side and you're going to push on your
},
{
    171.68,173.2
     jaw and not let it go out.
},
{
    173.2,176.64
     The jaw can go like this.
},
{
    176.64,179.64
     So one, two, three, four, five, six.
},
{
    179.64,182.84
     But actually the force is here, not up here.
},
{
    182.84,185.02
     Right on the bottom, we call them mandible.
},
{
    185.02,188.02
     Right, so you could actually do it here to make sure you're not.
},
{
    188.02,192.02
     I mean, you could do it anyway, but just for demonstration.
},
{
    192.02,196.02
     I'm going to push that way, my hand's maintaining it.
},
{
    196.02,197.02
     Another asymmetric.
},
{
    197.02,198.02
     And then we're going to do the other side.
},
{
    198.02,201.02
     One, two, three, four, five, six.
},
{
    201.02,204.02
     One, two, three, four, five, six.
},
{
    204.02,206.96
     Okay. The last three, it's actually one,
},
{
    206.96,210.76
     but they're all grouped into one, are for posture.
},
{
    210.76,214.68
     Bleeding up, the position of your head, neck, and jaw
},
{
    214.68,216.64
     really affect the TMJ.
},
{
    216.64,218.56
     If you have the head forward posture,
},
{
    218.56,220.72
     it is affecting your ability to swallow,
},
{
    220.72,223.0
     and it's affecting the position of the TMJ
},
{
    223.0,224.16
     and how it works.
},
{
    224.16,228.24
     So you really wanna work to the point where you're getting your head, you know, your ears
},
{
    228.24,233.12
     lined up with your shoulders, your head straight up, you know, right to your back.
},
{
    233.12,237.4
     Basic posture that we've talked about in many videos.
},
{
    237.4,242.48
     So the first one, they actually just take your hands and make like a collar, lock the fingers
},
{
    242.48,246.36
     and then you're holding the skin and then you're bending forward
},
{
    246.36,247.44
     like this.
},
{
    247.44,252.84
     And what that's doing is it's stretching, he's stretching the muscles right here under
},
{
    252.84,258.92
     the oxyput here, right, where the neck meets the head.
},
{
    258.92,263.56
     So actually you can keep them together, Brad, and just bend forward like that.
},
{
    263.56,264.56
     You feel that stretch?
},
{
    264.56,265.2
     Yep. Yep.
},
{
    265.2,266.04
     Yep.
},
{
    266.04,266.88
     Okay.
},
{
    266.88,269.28
     The next one is chin tucks,
},
{
    269.28,271.04
     which we've done many times.
},
{
    271.04,272.24
     So, yeah.
},
{
    272.24,273.52
     Go ahead.
},
{
    273.52,275.32
     So it's like you're backing your head up.
},
{
    275.32,276.24
     It's being real.
},
{
    276.24,277.44
     And again, you're stretching this,
},
{
    277.44,279.32
     and you're getting your neck and head
},
{
    279.32,280.44
     into the right position.
},
{
    280.44,281.28
     Right.
},
{
    281.28,282.12
     Basic posture.
},
{
    282.12,284.72
     Push her on, push her off, push her on, push her off.
},
{
    284.72,288.0
     Yeah. Like Brad always says, it's like someone throwing a pie in your face.
},
{
    288.0,292.0
     You're not going like this. You're not going like this.
},
{
    292.0,296.0
     You're going back. And the last one is shoulder squeezes, which we've done a million times.
},
{
    296.0,302.0
     Putting your shoulders blades together and trying to put them in your back pockets.
},
{
    302.0,306.0
     So, I must have gotten a little high, huh?
},
{
    306.0,308.0
     It's amazing how these...
},
{
    308.0,310.0
     I could use a lot of you to raise the camera.
},
{
    310.0,311.0
     Yeah.
},
{
    311.0,315.0
     These pastoral exercises cover so many things.
},
{
    315.0,316.0
     Yes, they do.
},
{
    316.0,318.0
     Breathing, jaw, neck, arms.
},
{
    318.0,321.0
     So, if you're having TMT problems,
},
{
    321.0,322.0
     try those things first.
},
{
    322.0,324.0
     You know, those are things you can do yourself.
},
{
    324.0,330.4
     And then if you have troubles, you know, you want to see a dentist who's trained in this orthodontist
},
{
    330.4,331.9
     or someone who's trained in this.
},
{
    331.9,336.3
     They can make you splints and there's pillows and all the things you'd like to avoid.
},
{
    336.3,338.4
     So maybe these are going to help and avoid that.
},
{
    338.4,343.54
     Give this a try and I'll link towards our last video here at the end, the one we did
},
{
    343.54,344.54
     on massage.
},
{
    344.54,345.48
     They all go
},
{
    345.48,350.88
     together don't they Bob? Yes they do. You agree? Yes I do. Alright thanks for
},
{
    350.88,355.16
     watching. That's incredible Bob you could be a ventriloquist.
},
