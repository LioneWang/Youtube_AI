     What's up guys?
},
{
    2.0,6.08
     Hey, Jared Bechstrand here, doctor of physical therapy, tonantitan.com, and today we're talking
},
{
    6.08,10.48
     all about shoulder pain and specifically the most common type of shoulder pain that I treat
},
{
    10.48,11.98
     as a physical therapist.
},
{
    11.98,14.96
     We'll talk about what it is, why you get it, and then I wanted to share with you about
},
{
    14.96,19.0
     six of my favorite exercises to hopefully alleviate some of that pain that you might
},
{
    19.0,20.0
     be experiencing.
},
{
    20.0,33.64
     So let's get into it right now. All right, you guys, hey, thank you so much for joining me today here on Tone and Titan.
},
{
    33.64,38.26
     I'm excited to be able to share a little bit of what I know about this topic with you.
},
{
    38.26,40.6
     Shoulder pain, it's an issue that I see in my clinic all the time.
},
{
    40.6,44.16
     Fortunately, there's a lot that you can do to kind of stretch and strengthen your way
},
{
    44.16,46.6
     out of it. I hope that the things that I share are going to
},
{
    46.6,49.56
     help some of you out. Hey, if you guys haven't done so already, quick plug for
},
{
    49.56,53.12
     the channel, go ahead and hit that subscribe button down below. That way
},
{
    53.12,56.4
     you'll never miss any new content that comes out from Tone and Titan. It means a
},
{
    56.4,60.16
     lot to me. Thank you so much in advance for doing that. Okay, so the most common
},
{
    60.16,64.36
     cause of shoulder pain that I treat in my physical therapy clinic is due to a
},
{
    64.36,68.7
     condition known as impingement. Now in order to understand impingement it's
},
{
    68.7,72.34
     important that I give you a little bit of an anatomy lesson. So I tell people you
},
{
    72.34,75.54
     know your shoulder is a ball and socket joint. Okay here's the socket, here's the
},
{
    75.54,80.58
     ball. That ball sits right up in that socket. It's the most mobile joint in
},
{
    80.58,84.14
     the body because of that anatomical arrangement. We can go through all these
},
{
    84.14,90.96
     ranges of motion as that ball rotates around in there. Now, in order for it to function properly,
},
{
    90.96,96.0
     that ball needs to be seated squarely and securely right inside of that socket. Most
},
{
    96.0,101.76
     of the shoulder pain that we experience starts to happen when that doesn't occur. Now, the
},
{
    101.76,107.8
     two most common causes of impingement that I see are going to be postural related issues and also rotator cuff weakness.
},
{
    107.8,112.42
     Now when I say posture what I mean is if I were to stand here with bad posture,
},
{
    112.42,118.04
     meaning I let my shoulders round forward, my chest is tight, my head comes forward, and then I try to reach overhead,
},
{
    118.08,120.64
     you'll see that that's as high as I can make it go.
},
{
    120.64,126.74
     I've got maybe what 160 degrees of motion there. just because what happens is we get into this position where a
},
{
    127.06,134.56
     Mechanical block occurs that ball can only rotate so far in that socket before it meets its end range before it hits
},
{
    134.72,139.08
     Those before it starts to impinge before it starts to pinch on those structures
},
{
    139.16,142.4
     Okay, so now what happens if I stand up straight so stand up straight
},
{
    142.4,146.84
     I'm going to tuck my shoulder blades back behind me and now what happens you see I can very easily
},
{
    146.84,152.88
     reach up to that straight 180 degree line overhead. And so a lot of the shoulder
},
{
    152.88,155.96
     pain that I see and a lot of this impingement problem that I see, what we
},
{
    155.96,159.68
     do is we work a lot on posture. We've got to get you out of this position and we've
},
{
    159.68,163.48
     got to get you up into this position so that everything can rotate freely. In
},
{
    163.48,167.32
     order to treat impingement we got to treat the posture issues.
},
{
    167.32,171.84
     Second thing is the, again, the rotator cuff muscle and rotator cuff weakness is a big thing
},
{
    171.84,172.84
     with this.
},
{
    172.84,179.22
     Now, your rotator cuff is actually four muscles whose primary function is to secure that ball
},
{
    179.22,182.12
     in that socket and keep it down there.
},
{
    182.12,184.28
     Keep it nice and tight, nice and secure in there.
},
{
    184.28,185.44
     In order for full motion
},
{
    185.44,189.92
     to occur, in order for our shoulder to be pain-free, we have to maintain some space. Basically,
},
{
    189.92,194.56
     if this is the roof, this would be my AC joint, this would be kind of my scapula, my shoulder blade
},
{
    194.56,199.28
     right here, here's the head of the humerus. There should be some space, you can see this space right
},
{
    199.28,209.68
     in here, there should be some space in that, especially when we reach all the way up and overhead. Now, what happens if that rotator cuff is not strong? You're going to get a little bit more
},
{
    209.68,215.52
     migration of that humerus of that ball in your socket. Meaning, as it starts to go overhead,
},
{
    215.52,220.56
     if all of a sudden it pinches up against the roof of that AC joint or the roof of your shoulder
},
{
    220.56,225.8
     blade, that's going to be the second cause cause or that is by definition, impingement.
},
{
    225.8,229.84
     And so if the rotator calf is weak, if it's not performing that function of keeping that
},
{
    229.84,234.62
     ball down secure in that socket, that's another common cause of pain.
},
{
    234.62,238.84
     And so now that you know the anatomy behind it, you know what we need to do to fix it.
},
{
    238.84,241.94
     We need to show you some stretches to improve your posture.
},
{
    241.94,245.6
     And then second, we need to strengthen the rotator calf muscles in order to keep that
},
{
    245.6,248.12
     ball nice and secure in that socket.
},
{
    248.12,252.0
     And so what I want to do now is share with you about six of my favorite exercises that
},
{
    252.0,253.84
     are going to address those two issues.
},
{
    253.84,255.2
     We'll talk about three stretches.
},
{
    255.2,258.52
     We'll talk about three strengthening exercises, and hopefully share some things that are going
},
{
    258.52,260.6
     to help you guys to start to feel better.
},
{
    260.6,264.96
     All right, so the first thing that we need to do is create a little more space, a little
},
{
    264.96,267.32
     more room for that shoulder to rotate.
},
{
    267.32,271.02
     And so basically what we need to focus on is stretching the entire front of the chest,
},
{
    271.02,274.28
     front of the shoulder, especially that anterior shoulder capsule or just that front part of
},
{
    274.28,279.68
     the shoulder right in there in order to get up and get upright into this really good posture.
},
{
    279.68,284.28
     And so one of the first stretch that I really like to do that is going to be a doorway stretch.
},
{
    284.28,287.56
     What you're going to do is just go up to a doorway, and I like to show the doorway stretch
},
{
    287.56,289.06
     in three different positions.
},
{
    289.06,290.6
     We're going to start with our hands low.
},
{
    290.6,294.36
     So put your hands on either side of the doorway, nice and low at a comfortable level at your
},
{
    294.36,298.52
     sides, and then take a big step in through the doorway, and then just put your weight
},
{
    298.52,300.2
     onto that front foot.
},
{
    300.2,303.12
     As you put your weight onto that front foot, you're going to feel a good stretch all through
},
{
    303.12,305.36
     the front of the chest, all through the front of the shoulder.
},
{
    305.36,307.72
     It might even pull up a little bit through your bicep tendon.
},
{
    307.72,310.66
     You're going to feel that right in the front of your shoulder area.
},
{
    310.66,312.12
     That's stretch number one.
},
{
    312.12,315.44
     Now the thing that I like about the doorway is that if that feels okay, let's move it
},
{
    315.44,316.44
     up a little higher.
},
{
    316.44,320.44
     So now put your hands up, oh, I don't know, a little bit lower than shoulder level, and
},
{
    320.44,321.44
     then do the same thing.
},
{
    321.44,325.08
     So your hands are about shoulder level, a little bit lower on the door frame.
},
{
    325.08,328.56
     Take a step into the door and just hang out right there.
},
{
    328.56,329.66
     I didn't mention on that first one.
},
{
    329.66,331.96
     You're gonna hold for about 20 to 30 seconds
},
{
    331.96,333.44
     and then come up out of it
},
{
    333.44,335.6
     and then you're gonna repeat that three times.
},
{
    335.6,338.5
     And so doorway stretch in the middle is number two.
},
{
    338.5,341.0
     The last thing that I love to do is a doorway stretch high.
},
{
    341.0,342.12
     Now this puts your shoulder
},
{
    342.12,344.4
     in a little bit more of a compromising position,
},
{
    344.4,347.76
     but if you can do it, I feel like this is the maximum way
},
{
    347.76,351.36
     that we can kind of stretch this out. And so what you do is you put your forearms
},
{
    351.36,355.16
     on the door frame. The elbows are up high, elbows are up at about shoulder level,
},
{
    355.16,359.08
     hands are higher than the head. In that position, now what you're going to do is
},
{
    359.08,363.0
     step through the door, again just until a comfortable stretch is felt through the
},
{
    363.0,367.2
     front of the chest, through the front of the chest through the front of the shoulders hold that for about a 20 second count and
},
{
    367.2,371.32
     repeat that three times and so that doorway stretch again the three
},
{
    371.32,374.42
     positions is a great way to just stretch again through the front of the chest
},
{
    374.42,379.08
     front of the shoulders open everything up and get into this upright position. Our
},
{
    379.08,382.92
     last one again another one of my favorites one that I do quite often is
},
{
    382.92,385.6
     going to be a foam roller stretch.
},
{
    385.6,387.0
     Now for this, you just need a foam roller.
},
{
    387.0,391.2
     I recommend a 36 inch foam roller just because it's a little more comfortable.
},
{
    391.2,392.64
     You can lay down on it.
},
{
    392.64,397.44
     It's going to go the entire length of your spine, just a little easier to work with.
},
{
    397.44,401.16
     If you don't have a 36 inch foam roller or access to one, you can pick one up for pretty
},
{
    401.16,402.16
     cheap.
},
{
    402.16,409.2
     What I'll do is I've got a link down in the description to this video for a 36 inch foam roller. Pick one of those up, you guys. You're not going to regret
},
{
    409.2,414.16
     it. And so to do this foam roller stretch, what you're going to do is sit on one end of the foam
},
{
    414.16,418.48
     roller and then lay down on it so that it's actually the length of your spine. So you're laying down
},
{
    418.48,423.76
     on your back on the foam roller. And really, even in this position, if you kind of rotate your palms
},
{
    423.76,425.72
     up and just lay on it like that,
},
{
    425.72,429.08
     that's a pretty good stretch to the front of the chest, front of the shoulders.
},
{
    429.08,433.92
     That's what we're after. I would spend even like, you know, one to two minutes just in that position.
},
{
    433.92,439.6
     If you feel like you need something a little bit more aggressive, you can bring your arms up to about a 90 degree height.
},
{
    439.6,444.64
     And now, all of a sudden, the weight of your arms are pulling your chest open a little bit more.
},
{
    444.64,445.22
     And so just, again, a good stretch to the front of the chest the weight of your arms are pulling your chest open a little bit more.
},
{
    445.22,448.54
     And so just again a good stretch to the front of the chest, front of the shoulder.
},
{
    448.54,451.66
     You're going to hang out there for again, I usually will just set like a one or two
},
{
    451.66,452.86
     minute timer.
},
{
    452.86,453.86
     That's what we're after.
},
{
    453.86,458.26
     And so you guys to get out of that poor posture, those are the three different stretches that
},
{
    458.26,459.82
     I like to do to do that.
},
{
    459.82,460.82
     Okay.
},
{
    460.82,463.18
     And so now let's jump into the rotator calf strengthening exercises.
},
{
    463.18,467.04
     The first thing, the easiest thing to do are going to be what we'd call some
},
{
    467.04,469.52
     scap pinches or some scapular pinches.
},
{
    469.76,472.48
     Now to do this, I can even demonstrate this for you guys right now.
},
{
    473.2,476.8
     What you're going to be focusing on is pulling your shoulder blades together
},
{
    476.8,479.68
     and then tucking them down into your back pockets.
},
{
    479.68,482.72
     And so to demonstrate that, again, we're standing right here.
},
{
    482.72,487.26
     I'm going to pull my shoulder blades together, but then I can also, what we'd call, depress
},
{
    487.26,488.42
     my shoulder blades.
},
{
    488.42,493.54
     Basically, in order for me to get all the way up and overhead, again, that shoulder blade
},
{
    493.54,496.76
     needs to kind of pull down and then also rotate up.
},
{
    496.76,499.12
     And so that's what we're going for with this exercise.
},
{
    499.12,500.72
     And so again, scap pinches.
},
{
    500.72,503.96
     We're going to pull back and then we're going to pull down and then we're going to hold
},
{
    503.96,508.28
     for about a three count and then relax. Pinch, pull down and hold
},
{
    508.28,513.34
     one, two, three and then relax. That's going to be a great exercise. Again, lower
},
{
    513.34,516.9
     traps and rhomboids are going to be crucial to that normal function in that
},
{
    516.9,521.24
     shoulder blade in order to get up and overhead. Scap pinches is a great way to
},
{
    521.24,526.24
     do that. Now my recommendation is about three sets of ten. If there's no resistance with it you'll probably get through about three sets of fifteen is a great way to do that. Now, my recommendation is about three sets of 10. If there's no resistance with it,
},
{
    526.24,528.5
     you'll probably get through about three sets of 15.
},
{
    528.5,530.4
     Is a good way to start to activate
},
{
    530.4,532.68
     the right postural muscles with this.
},
{
    532.68,534.6
     Now, if you want something a little more aggressive
},
{
    534.6,538.32
     than that, what I recommend would be a Y, T and A.
},
{
    538.32,540.6
     Sometimes people refer to it as a Y, T and I.
},
{
    540.6,542.84
     I think A's maybe a little bit more accurate.
},
{
    542.84,544.16
     Okay, so let's get into that one.
},
{
    544.16,548.24
     Lay down on your stomach, arms at your side, and then all that you need to do is keep your
},
{
    548.24,552.96
     arms straight and lift your arms up off of the table, hold for about a three second count,
},
{
    552.96,557.44
     and then come back to that starting position. Up again, hold for a three second count, and
},
{
    557.44,561.68
     then come back down to that starting position. This one, we're activating again all those
},
{
    561.68,568.32
     intrascapular muscles, but then we're also working a little bit more of the muscle in the back of the shoulder, those rotator cuff muscles that we
},
{
    568.32,569.66
     need to strengthen.
},
{
    569.66,573.28
     If that feels okay, let's jump into a T. And so now you're just going to bring your arms
},
{
    573.28,577.56
     up until they're at about a 90 degree angle, kind of straight out to your sides, and then
},
{
    577.56,578.92
     perform that same motion.
},
{
    578.92,583.6
     You're going to lift your elbows, lift your straight arms up off of the table.
},
{
    583.6,585.28
     Again, we're going to try to pinch
},
{
    585.28,589.52
     the shoulder blades together. We're activating muscles in the back of the shoulder to get to that
},
{
    589.52,594.88
     one. Finally, if you need even a step further than that, we can do Ys. And so a Y, you're still
},
{
    594.88,599.52
     going to lay on your stomach, except now you're going to lay down with your arms kind of overhead
},
{
    599.52,604.24
     in this Y position. And then perform the same activity. Keep your arms straight, lift your elbows
},
{
    604.24,605.28
     up off of the table, hold for a two to three second count, and then put them right down. And then perform the same activity. Keep your arms straight, lift your elbows up off of the table,
},
{
    605.28,606.84
     hold for a two to three second count,
},
{
    606.84,607.92
     and then put them right down.
},
{
    607.92,610.08
     And then each of those, what I tell people is
},
{
    610.08,611.36
     you're gonna repeat each of those,
},
{
    611.36,613.88
     the A's, the T's and the Y's, 10 times,
},
{
    613.88,616.48
     and then we're gonna do that whole series three times.
},
{
    616.48,619.64
     So three sets of 10 on each one of those exercises.
},
{
    619.64,621.44
     Some more of my favorite exercises
},
{
    621.44,623.24
     to strengthen that rotator calf,
},
{
    623.24,627.72
     probably my favorite, this is my personal go-to, are going to be your external rotation and your
},
{
    627.72,633.68
     internal rotation exercises. Now to do these, it does require a band and so the
},
{
    633.68,636.4
     version that I'm going to show you is going to require some resistance band.
},
{
    636.4,641.76
     You can also do these on the cables at the gym as another really good option. You
},
{
    641.76,645.12
     can get bands for really cheap. You can actually get sets of bands with different
},
{
    645.12,649.24
     resistances. To me, it's worth the investment. I've got a set here at home that I'm going
},
{
    649.24,653.64
     to be showing to you guys. If you're interested in picking up a set, again, link to my set
},
{
    653.64,657.2
     is in the description to this video. Go ahead and check that one out.
},
{
    657.2,661.44
     And so let's talk about the external rotation exercise first. What you're going to do is
},
{
    661.44,667.76
     stand upright and first step, you guys, good posture. So you're going to do is stand upright and first step you guys good posture. So you're going to roll your shoulders back. You're going to tuck your shoulder blades down.
},
{
    667.76,672.72
     Your elbow is bent to a 90 degree. You're going to grab that band or the cable or whatever the
},
{
    672.72,677.68
     handle and then keep your elbow at a 90. Keep your elbow tucked in right to your side and then
},
{
    677.68,684.24
     pull away against that band as you externally rotate basically away from the band just like
},
{
    684.24,686.28
     I'm showing you in this video.
},
{
    686.28,689.0
     Again, good posture is key with this.
},
{
    689.0,691.32
     We want that shoulder blade kind of down and back.
},
{
    691.32,695.44
     As you perform this exercise, I want you to focus on feeling this in the back of your
},
{
    695.44,696.44
     shoulder.
},
{
    696.44,700.32
     This one's really going to target and isolate those posterior rotator cuff exercises.
},
{
    700.32,702.44
     Again, it's my personal favorite.
},
{
    702.44,706.88
     I'll actually, before I go to the gym, before I do any upper body workouts,
},
{
    706.88,709.7
     I'll hit a set of these rotator cuff exercises real quick.
},
{
    709.7,711.5
     Just to warm it up, just to get it firing,
},
{
    711.5,713.08
     just to get some blood flow going,
},
{
    713.08,715.04
     really helps me to avoid some shoulder pain
},
{
    715.04,715.98
     that I've had in the past.
},
{
    715.98,718.2
     So I hope that helps you guys out as well.
},
{
    718.2,720.4
     Finally, let's look at internal rotation.
},
{
    720.4,723.16
     Basically, what you'll do is you'll just grab that same band,
},
{
    723.16,725.0
     you'll turn around 180 degrees,
},
{
    725.0,731.0
     and now you start with that handle out, kind of in that away position, in that externally rotated position,
},
{
    731.0,736.0
     and then you're going to pull it across your body. Again, posture is really important here.
},
{
    736.0,740.0
     I want you to keep your elbow to 90. I want you to keep that elbow tucked right into your side.
},
{
    740.0,746.08
     Don't let it drift out away from you, and don't let the elbow drift over in front of your body
},
{
    746.08,750.88
     while you're doing this internal rotation exercise. Now the thing about this, what I'll
},
{
    750.88,756.84
     typically tell people is I want you to do twice as many external rotation exercises as internal
},
{
    756.84,762.44
     rotation exercises. Again, if the problem is I'm rounding forward my shoulders and my chest are
},
{
    762.44,765.76
     rounding in like this, I don't want to perpetuate that.
},
{
    765.76,767.04
     I don't want to promote that
},
{
    767.04,769.38
     with all these internal rotation exercises.
},
{
    769.38,770.72
     Your biggest bang for your buck
},
{
    770.72,772.72
     is the external rotation motion.
},
{
    772.72,775.68
     However, it is important that we do, you know,
},
{
    775.68,778.6
     hit the internal and the external rotator component
},
{
    778.6,780.32
     of that rotator calf muscles,
},
{
    780.32,783.12
     of the rotator calf in order to keep those muscles
},
{
    783.12,784.28
     nice and strong.
},
{
    784.28,788.0
     Okay, so there you go, you guys guys on the internal and external rotation exercises.
},
{
    788.0,793.0
     What I'll do is I'll do a set of 10 external and then a set of 10 internal and then repeat that three times.
},
{
    793.0,797.0
     So three by 10 on your internal and external rotation exercises.
},
{
    797.0,802.0
     And so that's it you guys, that's shoulder impingement in a very brief video.
},
{
    802.0,808.34
     What we need to work on is we want to work on posture and we want to work on the strength of that rotator cuff. If you do those two things,
},
{
    808.34,811.84
     I promise that that shoulder is actually going to start to feel a lot better. And
},
{
    811.84,815.28
