     Bob and Brad, the two most famous physical therapists
},
{
    6.72,8.04
     on the internet.
},
{
    11.08,13.12
     Howdy folks, I'm Bob Schrupp, physical therapist.
},
{
    13.12,14.2
     Brad Heineck, physical therapist.
},
{
    14.2,15.72
     Together we are the most famous physical therapists
},
{
    15.72,16.56
     on the internet.
},
{
    16.56,17.6
     In our opinion, of course, Bob.
},
{
    17.6,19.12
     And we have a treat for you today.
},
{
    19.12,22.4
     Today we're gonna show you how to get rid of muscle knots
},
{
    22.4,28.36
     in the traps, trapezius, shoulders, and back in 90 seconds.
},
{
    28.44,30.22
     And this is not, we're not hyping it.
},
{
    30.22,34.1
     This is an actual technique and Brad's gonna talk about
},
{
    34.1,36.48
     how it worked on a different part of your body, right?
},
{
    36.48,37.84
     Oh yeah, I'm excited about this.
},
{
    37.84,40.0
     This is a, it's nothing new.
},
{
    40.0,42.48
     It's been scientifically proven by many studies,
},
{
    42.48,43.76
     clinically proven.
},
{
    43.76,47.8
     It started back in the 50s by Dr. Lawrence Jones.
},
{
    47.8,50.2
     And originally it's called strain colonists.
},
{
    50.2,51.84
     Strain colonists, that's what I remember
},
{
    51.84,52.68
     from my earlier days.
},
{
    52.68,55.88
     And now it's more often this positional release.
},
{
    55.88,57.28
     Typically a therapist does it,
},
{
    57.28,61.64
     but it's very, we can teach you the basic parts of this
},
{
    61.64,63.24
     so that you can do it at home.
},
{
    63.24,64.48
     Yeah, we're basically gonna show you
},
{
    64.48,65.64
     how to get this area right here, the knot on it. Right, you can do it at home. Yeah, we're basically gonna show you how to get this area
},
{
    65.64,67.56
     right here, the knot, out of there, right?
},
{
    67.56,69.08
     Right, shoulder, that upper back.
},
{
    69.08,71.6
     Very common place for knots.
},
{
    71.6,75.36
     It's a few steps, but just follow along with us
},
{
    75.36,76.64
     and you'll be able to catch that hold.
},
{
    76.64,77.92
     Exactly right.
},
{
    77.92,79.28
     So, Bob, are we gonna...

},
{
    110.82,111.66
     That is.
},
{

     if you want a 60 second version of our program every day.
},
{
    116.58,117.42
     All right.
},
{
    117.42,120.82
     So Bob, we've already started with the introduction of this.
},
{
    120.82,122.22
     We might as well get ready to work.
},
{
    122.22,125.04
     So why don't you turn around Bob?
},
{
    125.04,129.06
     That typical spot, there's a trigger point in this muscle,
},
{
    129.06,132.16
     oftentimes in the levator scapula or the upper trap,
},
{
    132.16,135.64
     that tightness that gets from poor posture, tension,
},
{
    135.64,138.64
     all those things that adds up with life.
},
{
    138.64,141.72
     And it seems to end up commonly right here.
},
{
    141.72,142.76
     I feel a little bit there.
},
{
    142.76,146.52
     Yeah, and every patient I have that I work on her shoulder,
},
{
    146.52,147.8
     I usually find that spot.
},
{
    147.8,148.92
     And I see you see that?
},
{
    148.92,151.44
     And I say, don't worry, everyone has it on both sides.
},
{
    151.44,155.24
     But when you're tight, it's painful, it's worse, much worse.
},
{
    155.24,158.04
     So what you'll wanna do when you feel that tightness
},
{
    158.04,162.92
     is take your opposite hand and reach over and find that nod.
},
{
    162.92,165.34
     You'll find the muscles a little noddier there.
},
{
    165.34,166.18
     It's right there.
},
{
    166.18,168.18
     It's an area of hyperirritability.
},
{
    168.18,169.02
     There you go.
},
{
    169.02,170.62
     It's a nodule basically.
},
{
    170.62,171.46
     A marble.
},
{
    171.46,173.5
     I had a school had a teacher say it.
},
{
    173.5,174.62
     It's like a Tootsie roll.
},
{
    174.62,175.46
     It kind of is.
},
{
    175.46,178.8
     It's about that size and you'll feel it and it's tender.
},
{
    178.8,181.58
     And when it's really knotted up, it's really tender.
},
{
    181.58,184.74
     So just palpate that and get a benchmark
},
{
    184.74,186.56
     for how painful it is.
},
{
    186.56,188.96
     Now you can do this in a couple different positions,
},
{
    188.96,191.8
     but I'm gonna show you how to do it sideline.
},
{
    191.8,195.28
     So if it's the right shoulder that has the knot,
},
{
    195.28,198.2
     then we're gonna lie on your left side.
},
{
    198.2,199.4
     You said it right Brad.
},
{
    199.4,201.7
     Well Bob, I've been practicing at home.
},
{
    201.7,203.36
     Can I have two pillows probably?
},
{
    203.36,205.72
     Yeah, we're probably gonna need two pillows.
},
{
    205.72,208.12
     All right, I can still palpate that area too
},
{
    208.12,209.16
     in this position.
},
{
    209.16,210.76
     Can you see that mic in the camera?
},
{
    210.76,212.68
     Are we getting off?
},
{
    212.68,214.12
     Should we back a little bit further?
},
{
    214.12,215.96
     Yeah, that might help.
},
{
    215.96,220.96
     Now, the thing about this is it's a positional release
},
{
    221.12,223.28
     and the position of your head and your shoulder
},
{
    223.28,224.74
     is very critical.
},
{
    224.74,228.84
     The whole idea, the muscle basically starts here
},
{
    228.84,231.88
     and goes up to the head and we wanna shorten that muscle
},
{
    231.88,233.6
     as much as possible.
},
{
    233.6,236.56
     And the whole theory is, is neurologically,
},
{
    236.56,238.8
     that's gonna allow the muscle to relax,
},
{
    238.8,240.72
     which is gonna increase circulation,
},
{
    240.72,242.24
     blood full and oxygen,
},
{
    242.24,245.04
     which is gonna allow that knot to release.
},
{
    245.04,246.4
     And you'll feel that when that,
},
{
    246.4,248.16
     get that circulation going,
},
{
    248.16,250.6
     everything feels much better and it carries on.
},
{
    250.6,252.64
     So now that we got the theory,
},
{
    252.64,254.56
     we're gonna go back to the practice.
},
{
    254.56,257.64
     So Bob is going to take his head,
},
{
    257.64,259.44
     if this is a painful side,
},
{
    259.44,263.24
     he's gonna side bend right ear towards the right shoulder.
},
{
    263.24,264.08
     Okay.
},
{
    264.08,267.92
     And then he's gonna look away from that shoulder, rotate.
},
{
    267.92,269.12
     No, I'm gonna extend first, all right?
},
{
    269.12,271.24
     Well, we can extend, not really far.
},
{
    271.24,272.08
     A little bit, a little bit.
},
{
    272.08,272.92
     Yeah.
},
{
    272.92,273.76
     I'm bringing my head back a little bit.
},
{
    273.76,275.68
     Yeah, exactly, sorry, good job, Bob.
},
{
    275.68,276.96
     Thanks for correcting me.
},
{
    276.96,279.24
     And then look away.
},
{
    279.24,280.96
     So this is kind of awkward position.
},
{
    280.96,283.52
     And then we need enough pillows
},
{
    283.52,287.88
     so that you can relax and maintain that position.
},
{
    287.88,290.0
     Now, you can palpate again.
},
{
    290.0,292.4
     If you feel that painful spot
},
{
    292.4,295.48
     dramatically, G decreases when you touch it,
},
{
    295.48,297.74
     this is all the farther you have to go.
},
{
    297.74,300.8
     Then you have a timer and you hit the timer,
},
{
    300.8,304.56
     or you look at the watch on a clock on the wall,
},
{
    304.56,306.56
     you know, it has second hand or whatever,
},
{
    306.56,309.8
     and you go for 90 seconds in that position.
},
{
    309.8,312.6
     It's critical you go at least 90 seconds
},
{
    312.6,314.56
     in order for things to release.
},
{
    314.56,317.52
     Now, if you palpate and still feel sore,
},
{
    317.52,321.44
     then we're gonna add shoulder or scapular elevation
},
{
    321.44,324.96
     so the shoulder goes up towards the ear.
},
{
    324.96,328.8
     You may want another pillow for this arm to relax in.
},
{
    328.8,330.34
     Or you could even go up like this, you said?
},
{
    330.34,331.18
     Or not.
},
{
    331.18,333.3
     Or you can reach over the top like this.
},
{
    334.22,336.62
     And you're gonna, and you can adjust yourself
},
{
    336.62,339.68
     however it takes so that muscle relax
},
{
    339.68,342.14
     in the painful spot that feels better there.
},
{
    342.14,342.98
     Yeah.
},
{
    342.98,343.82
     Yeah, there.
},
{
    343.82,345.94
     I can see Bob, his eyes are relaxing.
},
{
    345.94,348.7
     I can feel the knot is disappearing now,
},
{
    348.7,349.62
     the one that was there.
},
{
    349.62,352.14
     So what pain level were you at when you pushed initially?
},
{
    352.14,353.46
     Well, it wasn't much.
},
{
    353.46,354.3
     Right, because you're not,
},
{
    354.3,355.26
     you're not having,
},
{
    355.26,356.7
     but it was maybe at a two or three.
},
{
    356.7,357.7
     One or two I'd say.
},
{
    357.7,359.06
     That's pretty typical for the average.
},
{
    359.06,359.98
     And now it's gone.
},
{
    359.98,361.46
     That's gone, so you're there.
},
{
    361.46,363.02
     So, okay, are you ready?
},
{
    363.02,363.86
     Yeah.
},
{
    363.86,365.28
     Click, the timer goes,
},
{
    365.28,368.6
     and the person completely relaxed in the quiet area.
},
{
    368.6,370.24
     Again, 90 seconds.
},
{
    370.24,372.4
     Can you do this at a seated position, Brad?
},
{
    372.4,373.32
     Yes, you can.
},
{
    373.32,374.36
     Okay.
},
{
    374.36,376.28
     You probably want to do it in a recliner
},
{
    376.28,377.88
     or something where you can get pillows.
},
{
    377.88,380.28
     Maybe we'll show it real quick, seated.
},
{
    380.28,381.72
     We could try, yeah.
},
{
    381.72,382.68
     Well, I wasn't going to,
},
{
    382.68,383.96
     but we're gonna give them a bonus.
},
{
    383.96,384.8
     We might as well.
},
{
    384.8,388.56
     Yeah, that's right. So I'm gonna pretend 90 seconds went by.
},
{
    388.56,389.96
     It's pretty close to 90 seconds.
},
{
    389.96,391.08
     Yeah, it probably is.
},
{
    391.08,392.16
     People are probably complaining.
},
{
    392.16,393.56
     We're talking too much again.
},
{
    393.56,396.48
     Now it's really critical when you come out of this position,
},
{
    396.48,398.48
     you come out of it slowly
},
{
    398.48,400.56
     and you just relax your breathing.
},
{
    400.56,404.28
     So Bob, can you get up in a nice relaxed, slow manner?
},
{
    404.28,408.24
     So we don't, very, yep, breathing, relax.
},
{
    408.24,412.52
     And when you're done, now you can do some gentle
},
{
    412.52,415.48
     and slow range of motion with your neck.
},
{
    415.48,418.2
     We're not gonna get after this and stretch hard on it
},
{
    418.2,419.12
     or anything like that.
},
{
    419.12,420.92
     We're just gonna do some gentle motion.
},
{
    420.92,422.48
     Remember that muscles relax.
},
{
    422.48,425.4
     Now we want circulation to continue to flow.
},
{
    425.4,428.44
     Just allow it to continue to relax.
},
{
    428.44,433.16
     Also, you can do a little massage on it as well.
},
{
    433.16,434.36
     If you want, not hard.
},
{
    434.36,435.2
     You know, you don't have to.
},
{
    435.2,437.0
     It's already, the knot is gone.
},
{
    437.0,439.56
     We just need to get the circulation improved.
},
{
    439.56,440.92
     And then you're done.
},
{
    440.92,443.76
     You can repeat that three or four times a day.
},
{
    443.76,444.68
     Cause it may come back,
},
{
    444.68,445.8
     particularly if you're tense,
},
{
    445.8,446.88
     if you have poor posture,
},
{
    446.88,448.44
     you're not aware of it,
},
{
    448.44,450.92
     which is oftentimes why that particular
},
{
    450.92,454.08
     that starts and is originated.
},
{
    454.08,455.68
     Yeah, a lot of times you're not moving
},
{
    455.68,456.64
     and you're concentrating,
},
{
    456.64,458.24
     you're focused on your work
},
{
    458.24,459.48
     and that's how it develops.
},
{
    459.48,461.68
     But let's try to see it as a secret.
},
{
    461.68,465.64
     So basically I'm gonna do lateral side bend.
},
{
    465.64,467.5
     This'll help you even when you're lying down
},
{
    467.5,468.34
     to know what you're doing.
},
{
    468.34,469.18
     Right, the mechanics.
},
{
    469.18,471.64
     So I'm going to the right,
},
{
    471.64,473.8
     then I'm bringing it back a little bit.
},
{
    473.8,475.2
     Now I'm turning it away.
},
{
    475.2,476.04
     There you go.
},
{
    476.04,478.72
     And now I'm lifting this up like this.
},
{
    478.72,479.56
     Right.
},
{
    479.56,484.56
     Now again, Bob does not have a chair to lean into and relax.
},
{
    484.56,485.2
     And that would be a lot better if I wasn't a recliner. And then you would have a chair to lean into and relax. So this-
},
{
    485.2,487.28
     And that would be a lot better if I wasn't a recliner.
},
{
    487.28,488.48
     And then you would have a pillow,
},
{
    488.48,491.28
     at least one pillow there to rest your arm on.
},
{
    491.28,493.84
     We'd have a pillow here, a recliner
},
{
    493.84,495.4
     so you can adjust the angle
},
{
    495.4,498.16
     would probably be ideal for someone on this.
},
{
    498.16,499.72
     I actually gotta be honest, Brad.
},
{
    499.72,501.76
     I think I almost would rather do it sitting.
},
{
    501.76,504.0
     Yeah, it may be a good option.
},
{
    504.0,506.6
     I think, again, amen, amen.
},
{
    506.6,508.26
     It's one of those things in the clinic
},
{
    508.26,509.86
     it's easier sideline,
},
{
    509.86,511.24
     because you got a patient laying there
},
{
    511.24,512.08
     and it's easier to work with.
},
{
    512.08,515.12
     That really, that really snaps it away.
},
{
    515.12,516.24
     Bob, this has been proven.
},
{
    516.24,520.74
     I guess I'm a little shocked that it's working that well.
},
{
    520.74,521.58
     Yeah.
},
{
    521.58,524.32
     You know, because it was, it was there, it's gone.
},
{
    524.32,526.92
     This is gonna be big, Bob.
},
{
    526.92,529.32
     All right, well, if you wanna do it on the other side,
},
{
    529.32,530.76
     I'm gonna show that real quick too, Brad.
},
{
    530.76,532.64
     Because if anybody wanna try it on the other side,
},
{
    532.64,533.8
     they won't remember the steps.
},
{
    533.8,534.84
     Well, say no more, Bob.
},
{
    534.84,537.12
     So left side, left side problem,
},
{
    537.12,542.02
     we're gonna angle, you're gonna laterally side bend.
},
{
    542.02,544.16
     You're gonna extend it a little bit.
},
{
    544.16,546.04
     You're gonna turn away and then you're gonna extend it a little bit, you're gonna turn away,
},
{
    546.04,548.44
     and then you're gonna elevate the shoulder.
},
{
    548.44,551.4
     Yeah, if you don't have something to rest the arm on,
},
{
    551.4,553.6
     if you do it seated, it's not gonna work,
},
{
    553.6,555.84
     because your muscle is gonna contract
},
{
    555.84,557.44
     to hold that shoulder up, so you have to.
},
{
    557.44,559.04
     Yeah, yeah, everything's gonna work.
},
{
    559.04,560.48
     So it's not, you can't do it like this,
},
{
    560.48,561.8
     you gotta be leaning in a chair.
},
{
    561.8,565.6
     Yeah, you gotta support the elbow and the arm.
},
{
    566.48,569.76
     And actually, before we finish up, I did this.
},
{
    569.76,570.6
     We're gonna do another video on this.
},
{
    570.6,571.44
     Oh yeah, that's right.
},
{
    571.44,572.28
     You're gonna give it a test.
},
{
    572.28,576.2
     Tennis elbow, which I've been working on this for a while now
},
{
    576.2,579.08
     with my cross-friction massage that's been helping.
},
{
    579.08,581.8
     I did the other mobilization that was helping
},
{
    581.8,583.28
     and then I did this technique.
},
{
    583.28,584.12
     And it really helped.
},
{
    584.12,584.96
     Yeah.
},
{
    584.96,586.32
     I mean, the next day I forgot all about it.
},
{
    586.32,588.48
     It's like, oh my tennis elbow's gone.
},
{
    588.48,590.76
     It's like, we gotta make videos.
},
{
    590.76,591.6
     Yeah, he's gonna do a video on this.
},
{
    591.6,592.44
     We gotta show people.
},
{
    592.44,593.96
     Because I know there's nothing like
},
{
    593.96,595.72
     when it works on you really well.
},
{
    595.72,596.76
     Yeah, then you get it.
},
{
    596.76,599.64
     It's doubly, I mean we get excited for our patients,
},
{
    599.64,601.64
     but when you feel it in your own body,
},
{
    601.64,602.48
     I gotta admit it.
},
{
    602.48,603.32
     It does.
},
{
    603.32,605.04
     It does motivate you a little bit more.
},
{
    605.04,606.92
     It can be a life changer to some extent.
},
{
    606.92,608.52
     You know, I mean, I just remember
},
{
    608.52,609.76
     one of my shoulders bothered me
},
{
    609.76,612.4
     and we did the booyah stick and it went away.
},
{
    612.4,614.56
     I'm like, my God, that was a,
},
{
    614.56,615.4
     it was something.
},
{
    615.4,616.24
     You must share.
},
{
    616.24,617.08
     Share it to the world.
},
{
    617.08,617.92
     All right.
},
{
    617.92,618.92
     People are getting bored of us now.
},
{
    618.92,620.24
     Thanks for watching everybody.
},
{
    620.24,None
     Appreciate it.
},
