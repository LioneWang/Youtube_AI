     Our next guest thought she had a wart on her foot,
},
{
    3.16,6.4
     but it ended up being something much more
},
{
    6.4,7.9
     and it nearly took her life.
},
{
    8.96,10.84
     Rachel, a 40 year old mom of three,
},
{
    10.84,13.8
     says she felt like a piece of glass was stuck in her foot
},
{
    13.8,16.64
     and brushed it off thinking it was a plantar wart.
},
{
    16.64,19.54
     She started self-medicating with wart removal creams,
},
{
    19.54,21.44
     but more growth appeared on her foot
},
{
    21.44,23.28
     and she started to worry.
},
{
    23.28,24.48
     After seeing a dermatologist,
},
{
    24.48,30.1
     she learned she had melanoma, which had spread to other areas of her body. She had several surgeries
},
{
    30.1,36.04
     to remove the melanoma from her foot and reconstructive surgeries to replace part of her heel. Doctors
},
{
    36.04,41.88
     also removed melanoma from lymph nodes in her groin and tumors in her stomach lining.
},
{
    41.88,47.36
     Now Rachel wants to share her traumatic experience to help raise awareness and save lives.
},
{
    51.24,53.44
     Friend of the show oncologist Dr. Lawrence Pirro
},
{
    53.44,57.92
     is here along with Rachel who joins us now via Skype.
},
{
    57.92,61.44
     Rachel so very sorry that you've been through all of this
},
{
    61.44,63.28
     and I know how scary it must have been
},
{
    63.28,65.56
     and probably still is, but how are you doing now?
},
{
    65.56,67.12
     I'm doing really well, thank you.
},
{
    67.12,70.0
     I've just had my latest scan,
},
{
    70.0,73.48
     which is really reassuring.
},
{
    73.48,78.0
     Showed no further spread at this stage, which is amazing.
},
{
    78.0,80.32
     But unfortunately, as we know in melanoma,
},
{
    80.32,84.6
     there's still the chance that the cells still present.
},
{
    84.6,87.24
     Melanomas can look like almost anything.
},
{
    87.24,91.36
     We tend to think of them as black spots that are growing,
},
{
    91.36,94.4
     but they can have a cover over them
},
{
    94.4,96.08
     from the outer layer of the skin
},
{
    96.08,98.56
     and look like a wart, like was in your case.
},
{
    98.56,101.44
     They occur in areas where the sun doesn't shine.
},
{
    101.44,104.12
     Most of us think that they're only in sun exposed areas,
},
{
    104.12,105.56
     but this is a good example.
},
{
    105.56,108.46
     And I think the really important points are that
},
{
    108.46,111.12
     anything that's persistent on your skin
},
{
    111.12,113.02
     and doesn't look like a bronzo,
},
{
    113.02,114.96
     you should see a dermatologist.
},
{
    114.96,117.98
     Skin cancer by far the most common of all cancers,
},
{
    117.98,119.74
     as you often tell us,
},
{
    119.74,121.76
     we all know the importance of protecting your skin
},
{
    121.76,122.86
     from the sun.
},
{
    122.86,127.92
     But when it comes to protecting your children, what's so different about baby versus adult
},
{
    127.92,133.24
     sunscreens? Have a look. With one in five Americans developing skin cancer in their
},
{
    133.24,138.6
     lifetime, protection from harmful UV rays is so important. When it comes to
},
{
    138.6,142.8
     protecting children from the sun, many opt for general versions of sunscreen
},
{
    142.8,145.52
     labeled specifically for kids or babies.
},
{
    145.52,150.08
     But what makes baby sunscreen gentler? According to a new study done by the
},
{
    150.08,155.42
     Clean Label Project, nothing. The organization examined 95 of the best
},
{
    155.42,159.72
     selling sunscreens and sunblocks and found no significant difference between
},
{
    159.72,165.2
     baby, kid, and adult versions of sunscreen. But when it comes to toxins,
},
{
    165.2,166.88
     they did find something unsettling
},
{
    166.88,169.88
     in many bottles of black, lead.
},
{
    169.88,171.88
     Five of the tested brands had enough lead
},
{
    171.88,175.16
     in a dime-sized amount to exceed California's
},
{
    175.16,177.24
     mandated safety levels.
},
{
    177.24,179.86
     So what's the best way to protect yourself from the sun?
},
{
    179.86,182.52
     And is baby sunscreen just clever marketing?
},
{
    184.56,186.34
     Joints now to shed some light on the study
},
{
    186.34,189.28
     as executive director of the Clean Label Project,
},
{
    189.28,191.12
     Jackie Bowen.
},
{
    191.12,191.96
     Welcome, Jackie.
},
{
    191.96,193.16
     Welcome, Jackie.
},
{
    194.16,198.12
     We all want to do what's best for babies.
},
{
    198.12,199.04
     What did you find?
},
{
    199.04,201.48
     Is there a difference out there between the safety
},
{
    201.48,203.72
     of the Baby Sunscreen versus adult ones?
},
{
    203.72,207.96
     So the short answer is no, there's no difference. Clean Libra Project tested the
},
{
    207.96,209.8
     top ninety five products,
},
{
    209.8,212.6
     tested them for things like heavy metals, efficacy,
},
{
    212.6,215.2
     anti-oxidant activity, sulfites,
},
{
    215.2,218.76
     and what we found is no difference between baby and adult sunscreens.
},
{
    218.76,222.48
     So you're a consumer, we need to protect ourselves from skin cancer, what do we do now?
},
{
    222.48,225.52
     So the point of this discussion is not to scare people off sunscreen.
},
{
    225.52,228.44
     So sunscreen is really necessary, as you said,
},
{
    228.44,231.36
     because even if you wear a hat and sun protective clothing
},
{
    231.36,233.68
     and you avoid peak hours of UV exposure
},
{
    233.68,235.4
     between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.,
},
{
    235.4,236.86
     you're still gonna get some sun
},
{
    236.86,239.16
     and hopefully you're out there enjoying your life.
},
{
    239.16,242.64
     So how, Jackie, how do you recommend people determine
},
{
    242.64,247.08
     if the product they're considering is safe?
},
{
    247.08,248.16
     Well, let's say a few things.
},
{
    248.16,250.16
     Our findings did show that consistent
},
{
    250.16,252.6
     with American Academy of Dermatology,
},
{
    252.6,255.92
     SPF greater than 30 SPF, broad spectrum,
},
{
    255.92,258.12
     and waterproof is always important.
},
{
    258.12,260.04
     Of course, work with your family practitioner
},
{
    260.04,262.48
     or dermatologist to determine what's the best fit.
},
{
    262.48,264.8
     And overall, you can check out our website
},
{
    264.8,267.12
     at kalinaweproject.org as well.
},
{
    267.12,269.56
     It's time to...
},
{
    269.56,271.06
     Ask the doctor!
},
{
    272.56,273.4
     Woo!
},
{
    273.4,274.24
     Woo!
},
{
    274.24,275.32
     Woo!
},
{
    275.32,279.36
     This question came to us via video through social media.
},
{
    279.36,281.12
     Hey doctors, quick question.
},
{
    281.12,283.36
     I'm active and I'm logged to be outside,
},
{
    283.36,285.24
     but I feel like because I'm a ginger,
},
{
    285.24,287.42
     I get burnt really easily.
},
{
    287.42,288.88
     Ah!
},
{
    288.88,291.28
     Do I get sunburnt just because I have red hair?
},
{
    291.28,293.08
     And if that's the case, does that mean
},
{
    293.08,295.88
     that I'm in a greater chance of infallifying skin cancer?
},
{
    297.64,299.56
     People with red hair are special, right Drew?
},
{
    299.56,303.44
     She is a lovely young redhead, I love it.
},
{
    303.44,306.16
     And less than 2% of the world's population, unique.
},
{
    306.16,307.92
     Less than 2%.
},
{
    307.92,309.16
     And what's unique about them,
},
{
    309.16,312.52
     their melanin is different than the rest of us.
},
{
    312.52,314.68
     We have U melanin.
},
{
    314.68,317.76
     They have pheomelanin, which is a different type
},
{
    317.76,322.44
     of melanin, which makes them more susceptible to UV rays.
},
{
    322.44,323.76
     What's causing it?
},
{
    323.76,325.06
     A gene mutation.
},
{
    325.06,329.24
     There's a specific gene, MC1R.
},
{
    329.24,332.64
     In redheads, they have a pair of those.
},
{
    332.64,335.12
     So it changes their genetic makeup
},
{
    335.12,336.78
     when it comes to melanin.
},
{
    336.78,340.14
     So clearly more prone to sunburns.
},
{
    340.14,343.4
     That being said, more prone to skin cancers.
},
{
    343.4,346.08
     And we know our skin cancers, most common type,
},
{
    346.08,350.32
     basal cell, carcinoma, second scrimacell carcinoma,
},
{
    350.32,353.44
     and finally melanoma, the most lethal form
},
{
    353.44,354.56
     of skin cancers.
},
{
    354.56,359.56
     Unfortunately, redheads do have a higher chance
},
{
    359.88,362.0
     of developing these skin cancers.
},
{
    362.0,364.92
     That's why they have to be particularly vigilant.
},
{
    364.92,366.54
     What can you add to your diet
},
{
    366.54,371.04
     to decrease your risk of skin cancer by up to 15%?
},
{
    373.34,377.6
     Foods with Dr. Batra?
},
{
    377.6,378.94
     Vitamin A.
},
{
    378.94,380.28
     Woo!
},
{
    380.28,381.84
     Let's give it up for Vitamin A.
},
{
    381.84,384.72
     Yes, so this is actually a really interesting study
},
{
    384.72,387.2
     that was just published in JAMA Dermatology.
},
{
    387.2,390.6
     They looked at over 125,000 people
},
{
    390.6,392.6
     and looked at their long-term risk
},
{
    392.6,395.4
     of developing the second most common type of skin cancer,
},
{
    395.4,397.24
     which is called a squamous cell carcinoma,
},
{
    397.24,400.76
     and they found that those with the highest dietary intake
},
{
    400.76,405.0
     of Vitamin A had a 15% lower risk of SCC.
},
{
    405.2,407.52
     And so this is really interesting because vitamin A
},
{
    407.52,410.76
     is known to help promote skin cell differentiation,
},
{
    410.76,412.2
     turnover, growth.
},
{
    412.2,414.12
     It's something that we give us a synthetic form
},
{
    414.12,416.66
     to people at very high risk of skin cancer,
},
{
    416.66,418.4
     but the problem with vitamin A medications
},
{
    418.4,420.0
     is they have a lot of side effects,
},
{
    420.0,424.0
     like dry lips, dry eyes, hair loss, sun sensitivity.
},
{
    424.0,425.74
     And so in this case, none of these people
},
{
    425.74,428.64
     with the higher dietary vitamin A had these side effects,
},
{
    428.64,431.1
     but they did have the protective effect.
},
{
    431.1,435.52
     So super easy, carrots, kale, sweet potatoes, eggs.
},
{
    435.52,436.84
     I mean, all of these are things
},
{
    436.84,438.96
     that you should be incorporating in your diet anyway.
},
{
    438.96,440.92
     And if it decreases your risk
},
{
    440.92,443.52
     of the most common type of cancer in the United States,
},
{
    443.52,444.92
     I really feel like it's a no brainer.
},
{
    444.92,445.22
     Absolutely, and you do not need to study to get this A. increases your risk of the most common type of cancer in the United States, I really feel like it's a no brainer.
},
{
    445.22,448.5
     Absolutely, and you do not need to study to get this A.
},
{
    448.5,451.34
     Unless you're needy like me.
},
{
    451.34,452.42
     Eat those veggies.
},
{
    452.42,454.14
     But I will say one thing as a side note,
},
{
    454.14,456.56
     because I was mentioning those synthetic forms,
},
{
    456.56,458.64
     too much vitamin A can be dangerous.
},
{
    458.64,463.1
     Remember for men, the recommended daily amount is 3000 IU,
},
{
    463.1,465.04
     for women it's 2200 IU. So these shouldn't get you over that by any stretch, but do for women. It's 2,200 IU.
},
{
    465.04,467.16
     So these shouldn't get you over that by any stretch,
},
{
    467.16,469.28
     but do take it from the diet, not from something.
},
{
    469.28,472.04
     And I love how the food you put in your body
},
{
    472.04,474.84
     can protect you from the outside of your body.
},
