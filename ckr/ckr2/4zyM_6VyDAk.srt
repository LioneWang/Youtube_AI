     Hello, my name is Chip and I'm a paramedic instructor for the state of North Carolina.
},
{
    3.68,7.12
     And today we're going to talk about first aid treatment for a severed finger.
},
{
    7.12,12.88
     If you have to respond to someone or yourself, you lose a finger in some kind of an accident.
},
{
    12.88,17.12
     A couple things you need to take note of. Number one, we need to try to recover the finger.
},
{
    17.12,19.44
     So for demonstrated purposes, this will be our finger.
},
{
    19.44,23.2
     Let's just assume for a second that my finger is cut off.
},
{
    23.2,26.14
     Obviously the first priority is to stop the bleeding.
},
{
    26.14,30.44
     So we want to take and apply some kind of gauze or bandage directly to the site, slow
},
{
    30.44,32.76
     the bleeding down as best as possible.
},
{
    32.76,36.6
     Typically with a finger that is severed like that, there won't be a whole lot of bleeding.
},
{
    36.6,41.08
     Oftentimes the blood vessels will spasm and close up so you don't get a whole lot of bleeding.
},
{
    41.08,44.2
     One thing you need to take note of though, if you happen to see the bone, it's important
},
{
    44.2,47.84
     you don't rub the bone in because that can cause problems later on for the surgeon.
},
{
    47.84,51.4
     So again, just steady direct pressure, tape that down securely.
},
{
    51.4,56.32
     If bleeding starts to go through there, just apply more gauze and again, tape it down again.
},
{
    56.32,58.64
     Elevate it, that'll help with the bleeding control as well.
},
{
    58.64,62.16
     And obviously have the patient sit down or lie down so that they're not getting too dizzy
},
{
    62.16,64.56
     and unstable on their feet.
},
{
    64.56,65.68
     Now for the finger.
},
{
    65.68,68.56
     Of course we have gloves on during this whole ordeal.
},
{
    68.56,71.76
     With the finger we never want to touch the end that's been cut.
},
{
    71.76,72.92
     We do however want to clean it.
},
{
    72.92,77.16
     We can take some bottled water or tap water and gently rinse over it.
},
{
    77.16,79.52
     Once we do that we want to take and wrap the finger.
},
{
    79.52,83.16
     Sterile gauze or anything clean.
},
{
    83.16,88.48
     Simply want to wrap it up gently. We want to have a bag of ice.
},
{
    88.48,92.32
     That can be a cold pack of regular ice, but we never want to put the finger
},
{
    92.32,95.6
     directly on the ice because that'll cause damage and it could definitely
},
{
    95.6,100.24
     affect the way it can be reattached later. So we take the ice, put it in another
},
{
    100.24,106.48
     bag, put the finger again that's wrapped in that same bag on the ice.
},
{
    106.48,109.8
     Again, it's not touching the ice, it's got the gauze in between.
},
{
    109.8,115.04
     Zip that up and then we have a nice package to give to the folks on the ambulance, the
},
{
    115.04,120.08
     EMTs and paramedics or if you're at a hospital as far as very close to it and you don't wait,
},
{
    120.08,122.6
     you can go and just make sure you bring this with you.
},
{
    122.6,126.2
     Once you do, tell them if you can about what time the finger was cut off
},
{
    126.2,128.8
     and that you have a finger in there so they will put you as a priority
},
{
    128.8,132.3
     because there are some time limitations on reattaching that finger.
},
{
    132.3,135.3
     We want to go back to the patient to make sure the bleeding has stopped definitely
},
{
    135.3,140.4
     and if not, again, keep applying that bandage, more gauze, try to give firm pressure
},
{
    140.4,143.6
     and again make sure you call 911 if the bleeding is not controlled.
},
{
    143.6,145.3
     And that's how to treat a severed finger.
},
