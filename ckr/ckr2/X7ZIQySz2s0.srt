     Hey everybody, it's Doctor Jo and today I'm going to show you ways to relieve knee pain,
},
{
    4.0,7.12
     including hot and cold therapy. So let's get started.
},
{
    14.96,19.12
     So before we get started, if you haven't already, make sure and click on the subscribe button to
},
{
    19.12,26.4
     help my channel grow. So a lot of you ask me all the time with lots of injuries, should I use hot,
},
{
    26.4,29.72
     should I use cold, when should I use it? So I wanted to talk about it a little
},
{
    29.72,33.16
     bit before we get started into the stretches and exercises. Now there's
},
{
    33.16,39.08
     always exceptions to the rule but in general I say warm therapy or hot packs
},
{
    39.08,43.68
     to warm up the muscles before you do your stretches and exercises especially
},
{
    43.68,51.2
     if you have a hard time warming up and then use the cold therapy afterwards to help reduce inflammation. For using a hot pack,
},
{
    51.2,56.88
     iRelief sent me their hot and cold therapy gel packs and so they recommend putting a towel in
},
{
    56.88,63.36
     between it if you're using it on your bare skin. So you can put it in the microwave for about 50
},
{
    63.36,71.18
     seconds to heat it up and so these are really nice because one you can use them as a hot and cold pack to their gels
},
{
    71.18,78.0
     So they're really soft and comfortable and three is it comes with straps to help you really get it in place and get it
},
{
    78.0,82.8
     Comfortable you only really want to do heat for maybe 10 to 15 minutes
},
{
    82.8,85.28
     What you're trying to do is loosen up the
},
{
    85.28,89.08
     muscles, warm up the muscles before you go in those stretches and exercises. And
},
{
    89.08,92.6
     what that helps you do is it usually gets a more beneficial stretch and
},
{
    92.6,96.72
     exercise because those muscles are already loosened up. If you do stretches
},
{
    96.72,101.24
     from what we would call cold or stiff, you're still going to get some benefit
},
{
    101.24,108.4
     but it's not going to be quite as much. And so sometimes people say riding a bike to warm up, jogging in place, marching in place.
},
{
    108.4,111.8
     That's a great way to warm up, but if you're having a lot of knee pain, sometimes you're
},
{
    111.8,115.04
     not going to be able to do that, or you don't have a stationary bike to warm up.
},
{
    115.04,118.98
     So using a heat pack is a really nice way to do that.
},
{
    118.98,122.84
     So after you've gotten it nice and warmed up, then you're going to go into some stretches.
},
{
    122.84,128.6
     You can use a stretch strap if you have one. You can use a dog leash if you have a dog leash or just a belt. You want
},
{
    128.6,133.32
     to make something, get something so you can make a loop. So the first one is going to
},
{
    133.32,140.16
     be a calf stretch. Excuse me, frog in my throat. For the calf stretch, you want to have it
},
{
    140.16,145.32
     around the ball of your foot. If you are on something like a futon or couch or
},
{
    145.32,148.6
     something, put your heel just a little bit off the edge so you've got some more
},
{
    148.6,152.84
     movement in there. If you if you don't then you can just take a little rolled
},
{
    152.84,156.2
     up towel or something and put underneath and that just gives you some more room
},
{
    156.2,159.92
     for your heel to have movement so you'll get a better stretch. So for the calf
},
{
    159.92,164.16
     stretch underneath here it comes and crosses that knee so you really want to
},
{
    164.16,168.32
     get it nice and loose up that will help with the knee pain. Relax your foot.
},
{
    168.32,172.8
     You're doing the movement with the strap. So you're not actively moving it
},
{
    172.8,175.76
     towards you, you're pulling it towards you. And you should feel that stretch
},
{
    175.76,179.6
     again, kind of in that calf area. You might feel a little more at the
},
{
    179.6,183.08
     Achilles. You might feel it more behind the knee. You will hold that stretch for
},
{
    183.08,189.36
     about 30 seconds. And it should be comfortable, not painful, a little bit of tension, a little bit of uncomfortableness,
},
{
    189.36,195.68
     but no pain. So holding it for 30 seconds, relax, and you're going to do that a total of three times.
},
{
    195.68,200.4
     Getting that nice stretch in there, try to keep that knee straight. If you start bending the knee,
},
{
    200.4,203.92
     you're going to stretch a different muscle, which is your soleus muscle. So if you want to stretch
},
{
    203.92,208.64
     the calf, make sure that knee is nice and straight and everything is relaxed. After you do
},
{
    208.64,214.56
     that three times then you're going to go into a hamstring stretch. You can keep the strap in the
},
{
    214.56,221.92
     exact same spot and then you're just going to go lie down on your back and then still keeping that
},
{
    221.92,228.36
     leg nice and straight. You're just going to start pulling up with the strap. So again you're not lifting your leg, you want your
},
{
    228.36,231.08
     leg to be nice and relaxed for the stretch because that's going to help
},
{
    231.08,236.0
     give you a nice stretch. Those hamstrings underneath the leg cross the knee joint
},
{
    236.0,240.52
     the other way. So again you want to get these nice and stretched out. If you start
},
{
    240.52,244.88
     bending your knee as you come up because it's tight then you're not going to get
},
{
    244.88,248.14
     a good stretch because again since they they cross that joint, you want to keep this
},
{
    248.14,249.14
     leg straight.
},
{
    249.14,253.56
     So even if you have to come back down a little bit, come back down to get that nice stretch.
},
{
    253.56,255.72
     You might feel it a little bit higher up.
},
{
    255.72,259.36
     You might feel it down more by the knee, just depending on where it's really tight.
},
{
    259.36,264.14
     So again, holding it for 30 seconds, coming down, give it a quick little break, and then
},
{
    264.14,266.24
     doing that three times.
},
{
    266.24,268.92
     So the next one is going to be an IT band stretch.
},
{
    268.92,271.68
     It's almost the same setup as the hamstring stretch.
},
{
    271.68,276.92
     I've said often I'll then put this leg down just to get it out of the way.
},
{
    276.92,281.32
     So you're still coming up, and then once you start feeling just a little tension in your
},
{
    281.32,284.92
     hamstrings, you're going to bring it across your body.
},
{
    284.92,289.48
     Now the key here is keep this hip down. Sometimes people will roll up and go all
},
{
    289.48,292.6
     the way but then you're not stretching your IT band, you're just then
},
{
    292.6,297.44
     stretching your low back. So try and keep your hip down and then just gently
},
{
    297.44,301.48
     bring it across your body and you should feel it that IT man. You're really
},
{
    301.48,305.32
     stretching that tensor fascia lata, that TFL muscle, but IT man
},
{
    305.32,308.6
     is what everybody hears about, so that's why it's called the IT band stretch.
},
{
    308.6,312.4
     But the IT band crosses the knee, comes up into that muscle belly there.
},
{
    312.4,315.96
     So you might feel a little bit more at the hip, you might feel it more at the knee, just
},
{
    315.96,318.14
     whatever is most comfortable for you.
},
{
    318.14,324.04
     So again, 30 seconds coming back down, doing that three times.
},
{
    324.04,326.0
     So then you're going to go over into a
},
{
    326.0,330.8
     quad stretch. So this is rolling over onto your tummy. I like to take the strap
},
{
    330.8,337.4
     and then kind of bring it around to the ankle and then once you roll over onto
},
{
    337.4,342.24
     your tummy you're going to take the strap and just kind of put it around your
},
{
    342.24,347.98
     shoulder. You can kind of bring up your your leg a little bit and then just get into a comfortable
},
{
    347.98,351.8
     position. Now I'm propping up on my elbows just so I can see you a little bit
},
{
    351.8,355.48
     better but make sure you're comfortable. So if you need to lie all the way down
},
{
    355.48,358.92
     so you're not stressing out your back or your neck that's fine just make sure
},
{
    358.92,364.36
     you're comfortable and then gently start pulling until you feel tensioned out in
},
{
    364.36,366.24
     your quad which is the front of your
},
{
    366.24,369.8
     leg or your thigh area, your front thigh area.
},
{
    369.8,375.04
     So you might only be able to get to here if you have knee pain.
},
{
    375.04,376.04
     That's fine.
},
{
    376.04,380.2
     Just go again, go to where there's tension, go to where it's a little uncomfortable, but
},
{
    380.2,383.08
     hold that stretch for 30 seconds, come back down.
},
{
    383.08,386.84
     You don't have to go all the way back down if you don't want to, but just get that tension off of it.
},
{
    386.84,389.18
     Give it a little break and then come back up
},
{
    389.18,392.38
     for a total of three times for 30 seconds.
},
{
    393.54,396.04
     So once you get all those main muscle groups
},
{
    396.04,398.66
     that kind of cross the knees stretched out,
},
{
    398.66,401.74
     then you're gonna go into some exercises.
},
{
    401.74,404.74
     We're just gonna do some gentle exercises,
},
{
    404.74,405.4
     mostly isometric exercises today. some exercises. We're just going to do some gentle exercises, mostly
},
{
    405.4,410.8
     isometric exercises today. So one of the big muscles that decides to shut down
},
{
    410.8,415.56
     when you have knee pain is your quad muscle. So a nice easy way to get it
},
{
    415.56,419.2
     started moving, get a little bit of strengthening in it, just get it to
},
{
    419.2,424.6
     activate again. It's a quad set and set just is kind of an isometric version of
},
{
    424.6,426.08
     you're activating the muscle,
},
{
    426.08,431.44
     but you're not really moving it, which might cause pain. So I usually like to use a little target.
},
{
    431.44,436.56
     This is just a little pull noodle, but you can roll up a towel, you don't have to go out and get
},
{
    436.56,440.56
     anything. And you don't even have to put anything underneath. I like to put something underneath
},
{
    440.56,447.2
     because I feel like it gives me a target. So with a quad set, your heel is going to be down the whole time. So it's not lifting up like that.
},
{
    447.2,451.34
     That's a different exercise. You're keeping that heel down and you're just
},
{
    451.34,457.0
     pushing that knee down into the roll so this quad muscle is activating. Now if
},
{
    457.0,461.12
     you have knee pain, it might not be activating very much. It might be just
},
{
    461.12,466.64
     kind of in guarding mode. So the goal is to see that contraction if you can.
},
{
    467.2,472.24
     Once you go down, you push into that roll or that towel, try and hold it for about three to five
},
{
    472.24,477.84
     seconds and then relax. You can start off with just five to ten. You know, again, if you're having
},
{
    477.84,482.32
     pain, you don't want to go overboard with this, but eventually you can work your way up to ten to
},
{
    482.32,485.44
     fifteen, a couple sets, a couple times a day,
},
{
    485.44,490.48
     just depending on what your injury is, what your pain level is, and what your goals are.
},
{
    490.48,494.44
     So three to five seconds holding and then relax.
},
{
    494.44,500.06
     So the next one is going to be a hamstring set, which is the muscles underneath.
},
{
    500.06,504.52
     And so same kind of concept where you're activating the muscles, but you're not really moving
},
{
    504.52,506.24
     the muscles where it might cause pain.
},
{
    506.56,510.44
     So with a hamstring set, you can do it lying all the way down.
},
{
    510.44,512.12
     You can do it kind of sitting up like me.
},
{
    512.28,514.24
     You can also do it in a chair as well.
},
{
    514.48,516.36
     But what you're doing, this is the motion.
},
{
    516.36,517.24
     I'm going to lift my leg up.
},
{
    517.24,517.92
     You don't have to do this.
},
{
    518.36,525.32
     I'm pulling in because that's what activates the hamstrings is when you're pulling your heel back behind you.
},
{
    525.32,529.88
     So, instead of pulling it, I'm pushing down and in.
},
{
    529.88,535.52
     So this is what I'm doing, but the couch or the floor or wherever I am is stopping me
},
{
    535.52,536.52
     from doing it.
},
{
    536.52,541.72
     But when I push my heel kind of down and in, those hamstring muscles are going to activate.
},
{
    541.72,548.88
     So same thing, just maybe a three to five second hold. If you haven't done these before hamstrings are notorious for cramping so I
},
{
    548.88,553.52
     would just start off with a little push, maybe 25 to 30 percent and then kind of
},
{
    553.52,557.1
     work your way up from there. But again, holding it for that three to five seconds,
},
{
    557.1,562.32
     five to ten, working your way up a couple times a day. And so the last one is
},
{
    562.32,569.52
     going to be bridging. And so bridging is one of my favorite exercises, but it's great for knee pain because not only are you
},
{
    569.52,572.16
     getting movement in there, but you're working your hamstrings and you're
},
{
    572.16,575.68
     working your glutes and your glutes have a lot to do with strengthening your
},
{
    575.68,580.24
     knees as well, even though they're not connected. But the hamstrings are. So with
},
{
    580.24,585.52
     a bridge, when you're coming up, imagine kind of going up one segment at a time.
},
{
    585.52,587.44
     You don't have to stop at each one,
},
{
    587.44,590.32
     but you're kind of driving those knees away from you,
},
{
    590.32,591.66
     towards the wall away.
},
{
    591.66,592.5
     That's what you're doing.
},
{
    592.5,595.32
     You're coming up, really activating those muscles.
},
{
    595.32,598.2
     So you're not just pushing straight up with your heels.
},
{
    598.2,600.52
     You're rolling forward
},
{
    600.52,602.78
     until you can get into a pretty straight line.
},
{
    602.78,604.62
     You might not be able to get all the way up there.
},
{
    604.62,607.28
     You might only be able to get here, but the goal is to
},
{
    607.28,613.24
     eventually try and get in a pretty straight line and then roll back down. So
},
{
    613.24,617.08
     it's a slow control movement. It's not just going up and down, but really trying
},
{
    617.08,620.72
     to control it. Really activate those muscles, get that squeeze in the glutes
},
{
    620.72,629.36
     at the end, and then nice and slow coming back down. So again, depending on your pain level, just start off with five to ten a set or two and
},
{
    629.36,633.72
     then kind of work your way up from there a couple times a day. So after you get all
},
{
    633.72,639.2
     that done, I've worked my knee, I've stretched it out, it's a little warm, it's
},
{
    639.2,642.88
     a little irritated because I've been doing stuff and it's already injured. So if I
},
{
    642.88,645.52
     have a little bit of inflammation or just to calm it back down,
},
{
    645.76,649.24
     then that's when I would use the cold therapy. So
},
{
    649.92,654.64
     it's the same concept. You only really want to do cold therapy for about 10 to 15 minutes.
},
{
    654.64,660.24
     And it's really important for that because a lot of times when you're using ice or cold therapy,
},
{
    660.24,669.32
     if you leave it on for a long period of time, your body almost ends up going into protection mode because it thinks maybe hypothermia is going on and it actually starts warming
},
{
    669.32,670.32
     back up the air.
},
{
    670.32,675.24
     It's a really 10 to 15 minutes is kind of the ideal time when you're using something
},
{
    675.24,676.24
     like a cold pack.
},
{
    676.24,680.96
     So I'm going to use a slightly smaller one here and so to freeze it, you want to freeze
},
{
    680.96,684.4
     it up to an hour, but it's the same kind of concept.
},
{
    684.4,688.76
     Our relief has the nice strap so you can get some compression on there too so you're
},
{
    688.76,692.8
     not just sitting it on there you really want to make sure that it's nice and
},
{
    692.8,697.2
     solid in there just to kind of calm everything back down and relax it back
},
{
    697.2,701.36
     down slow everything back down and help that healing process. So again you can
},
{
    701.36,705.4
     see here I want to kind of show you this one and then
},
{
    705.4,711.28
     the bigger one here and then they also have a little bit smaller one for maybe
},
