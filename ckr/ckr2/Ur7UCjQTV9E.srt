     Hey guys, I'm Sebastian at Forints Play Sports Care. We're going to cover a sports hernia exam
},
{
    4.32,8.64
     today. Many of you have been looking online for what an examination might look like with a sports
},
{
    8.64,13.76
     hernia, trying to confirm your sports hernia diagnosis. So I'm one half of the locally
},
{
    13.76,17.84
     world famous chiropractors in Orange County, California. Come see us if you have growing pain.
},
{
    17.84,22.16
     So the ear we're talking about with the sports hernia is we're talking about right around here
},
{
    22.16,26.64
     around the flank and just into the center here, where it's still kind of
},
{
    26.64,32.16
     fleshy. You can have pain here or here or here, that's associated, but a lot of
},
{
    32.16,34.48
     time people experience it right here when they do so.
},
{
    34.48,37.52
     And so the first thing we're going to do, go ahead and stand right here.
},
{
    37.52,40.88
     I'll pull back just so we can see the exam. So stand right there and just make
},
{
    40.88,45.66
     sure the cameraman gets all of her body. And so usually what indigamination will look like
},
{
    45.66,48.2
     is it'll take you through a variety of movements
},
{
    48.2,50.34
     just to see if we can challenge certain structures.
},
{
    50.34,55.14
     Cause if in theory, if your abdominal area has been torn,
},
{
    55.14,58.04
     it'll present itself with some type of movement.
},
{
    58.04,60.66
     A lot of you will say, well, it only hurts when I run,
},
{
    60.66,62.54
     but we can simulate stuff like that,
},
{
    62.54,65.68
     walking upstairs, deep hip flexion
},
{
    65.68,68.04
     to really challenge the area.
},
{
    68.04,72.96
     This will also screen out other types of diagnosis like hip impingement, laboral tears, referral
},
{
    72.96,74.72
     from the spine and so on.
},
{
    74.72,77.12
     So go ahead and feet together for me.
},
{
    77.12,78.44
     Bend forward as far as you can.
},
{
    78.44,80.44
     Let me know if any of this bothers you.
},
{
    80.44,81.44
     And come on back up.
},
{
    81.44,83.76
     Give me one more of those, okay?
},
{
    83.76,85.9
     Usually I'll stand in front of them just to look and see.
},
{
    85.9,87.1
     Going back up again.
},
{
    87.1,90.2
     Can you bend backwards as far as you can?
},
{
    90.9,93.3
     Now, sometimes people with groin pain don't like this.
},
{
    93.3,94.3
     Go ahead and come back up.
},
{
    94.3,96.3
     They'll feel like it comes into here a little bit.
},
{
    96.3,99.4
     And so, an easy thing to do is hands on the hips now.
},
{
    99.4,102.0
     Push the hips forward. Don't try to lean back.
},
{
    102.0,104.8
     And so now we're pushing more extension through the hip
},
{
    104.8,106.6
     versus the abdominal area.
},
{
    106.6,111.2
     Because again, if that abdominal area really has a strain or a tear, then we're challenging
},
{
    111.2,113.64
     it via a stretching mechanism.
},
{
    113.64,118.04
     So other things, do a little teapot, go like that for me, and like that.
},
{
    118.04,123.48
     We're also testing some hip range in motion and giving a little slow twisty twist.
},
{
    123.48,126.04
     As you see, Mary Lou's hips are rotating nicely as well as the rest of her body too. That way it looks a little slow twisty twist. As you see, Mary Lou's hips are rotating nicely,
},
{
    126.04,127.38
     as well as the rest of her body too.
},
{
    127.38,129.24
     That way looks a little sticky,
},
{
    129.24,132.8
     but she can turn generally and look over her shoulder.
},
{
    132.8,133.96
     Let's try a deep squat now.
},
{
    133.96,135.46
     The best squat that you can do.
},
{
    137.52,138.68
     Good, come on back up.
},
{
    138.68,139.96
     Try a couple of these.
},
{
    142.0,144.6
     Mary Lou likes to shift to this side of her body.
},
{
    144.6,149.64
     And so there's, it's actually very common that people have groin pain in the side that
},
{
    149.64,150.8
     they shift weight to.
},
{
    150.8,152.92
     She might have had a left turn to ankle before.
},
{
    152.92,153.92
     Did you?
},
{
    153.92,154.92
     Did you?
},
{
    154.92,155.92
     Yeah.
},
{
    155.92,156.92
     There you go.
},
{
    156.92,160.0
     So, some of you will probably wonder like why this happened?
},
{
    160.0,161.0
     Why just keep happening?
},
{
    161.0,163.32
     Like, so the body likes to compensate.
},
{
    163.32,167.12
     It does not always painful to compensate, but but when it when you have to compensate,
},
{
    167.12,171.52
     sometimes overload in that area produces the problem.
},
{
    171.52,174.32
     So it's more of an underutilization of the other side of the body.
},
{
    174.32,175.52
     At least maybe in her case.
},
{
    175.52,178.08
     Now let's take an actually stress test to hit a little bit.
},
{
    178.08,179.44
     Go online, you're back for me.
},
{
    182.24,184.88
     Now, I know I mentioned hip a lot already,
},
{
    184.88,188.48
     but it's good practice to make sure that when
},
{
    188.48,193.2
     you're being examined for spartania that we need to make sure we stress test the area
},
{
    193.2,197.72
     here, which we'll do in a second, but also look at the area surrounding such as the hip
},
{
    197.72,199.12
     and the lower back.
},
{
    199.12,206.4
     We won't do the lower back too much today, but we will do a couple tests which are their neural tension test because
},
{
    206.4,209.52
     sometimes the referral from the back is really common here.
},
{
    209.52,211.68
     So the first thing we're going to do is stress test the area here.
},
{
    211.68,214.04
     And if she walks in like this, we can do this.
},
{
    214.04,216.36
     But if she's just lit up, we probably wouldn't want to do this.
},
{
    216.36,217.36
     Okay.
},
{
    217.36,219.6
     I'm going to put my fingers just kind of in the fleshy area down there.
},
{
    219.6,220.6
     Okay.
},
{
    220.6,222.36
     And so maybe that's where you feel your symptoms.
},
{
    222.36,225.76
     Can you do a little quarter sit up for me? And down.
},
{
    225.76,227.92
     And again, and down.
},
{
    227.92,228.76
     One more.
},
{
    229.64,230.48
     No problems with that?
},
{
    230.48,231.32
     No.
},
{
    231.32,232.16
     Good.
},
{
    232.16,235.84
     And so we're looking for, is a clear divot forming or a lag.
},
{
    235.84,236.68
     Okay.
},
{
    236.68,239.08
     And so when we find that, there's a possibility
},
{
    239.08,241.04
     that you do in fact have a sports hernia.
},
{
    241.04,242.76
     Since if we're looking at a sports hernia,
},
{
    242.76,246.72
     it's gonna be a tearing of the of the
},
{
    246.72,251.68
     fascia down there but if there's not really anything found in this then you probably don't have it.
},
{
    251.68,258.4
     Now some people will say that you do tests like push me that way like a resisted adductor one that
},
{
    258.4,263.36
     will light them up. Yeah it'll probably light them up and if you get a cut on your hand you decided
},
{
    263.36,265.16
     to punch a wall or squeeze it
},
{
    265.16,266.86
     a lot and probably hurt it too.
},
{
    266.86,271.18
     It's not an indication that this is actually a sports hernia but it will give, it'll give
},
{
    271.18,274.24
     some light about what movements bother her you know.
},
{
    274.24,280.64
     So you could do a MRI or ultrasound, most people don't need it but that'll confirm beyond
},
{
    280.64,284.94
     reasonable doubt if there's actually a tissue disruption or a tear within the sports hernia
},
{
    284.94,285.44
     area.
},
{
    285.44,288.16
     I'm also able to do not need it before starting care.
},
{
    288.16,290.52
     All I need is an exam just like this.
},
{
    290.52,295.36
     So the next thing you like to do is stress test the area, specifically more on the hip,
},
{
    295.36,301.32
     and I'm going to be looking right here to see if she has any tendencies of not using
},
{
    301.32,305.16
     or not being able to stiffen her spine because if she can't then she'll
},
{
    305.16,311.48
     have overload into that region too. Go ahead and hold me. Good and relax. Does that hurt you?
},
{
    311.48,318.96
     Good. Pull me down. Hamstring curl. Good. Kick me up. Good. And we'll do the one
},
{
    318.96,327.76
     that everyone likes to do. Pull that way. Good. And the other way. Good. So we stress tested the air rib pretty good.
},
{
    327.76,331.76
     All right. Not highly sensitive. Why did we do the hamstring curl one and stuff?
},
{
    331.76,335.52
     Because all those muscles cross the hip. And as we know at this point in time,
},
{
    335.52,340.72
     when you if you have a sports hernia or groin pain, you're going to have some type of hip problem.
},
{
    340.72,345.4
     Whether it's underutilized or overutilized or muscular imbalances, you're going to have
},
{
    345.4,350.28
     some type of hip problem, so we need to normalize the function of the hip.
},
{
    350.28,352.52
     That's probably the most important takeaway in this.
},
{
    352.52,354.02
     Most people don't need surgery.
},
{
    354.02,356.36
     They need to make sure their body is working well.
},
{
    356.36,361.36
     The next thing we can do is something, this is more examination deep within the hip socket,
},
{
    361.36,365.36
     but I like to grab the leg right here and hold it nice and firm. We're going to scour the socket of the hip socket, but I like to grab the leg right here and hold it nice and firm.
},
{
    365.36,367.84
     And so we're gonna scour the socket of the hip.
},
{
    367.84,372.5
     And so I'm gonna push her hip up into the hip socket
},
{
    372.5,376.46
     and then a rub of the rim and see if it lights her up or not.
},
{
    376.46,379.92
     For a lot of people, going across the body like this
},
{
    379.92,382.72
     will light them up and they're like, yeah, that's my symptom.
},
{
    382.72,391.04
     In that case, this is probably not a sport turnia. It's probably hip impingement. If it's a deep clunk and a painful clunk and click
},
{
    391.04,395.04
     and associated with this test or they're just blocked, they can't go in and they can't turn like
},
{
    395.04,400.32
     this, this is probably more of a labor issue. Okay. And that's a labrum of the hip. We'll also
},
{
    400.32,406.6
     check the outer part. We'll, we'll drive into different quadrants of the hip.
},
{
    407.72,410.28
     And generally we can see her hip moves nicely.
},
{
    411.08,412.06
     Is it functioning well?
},
{
    412.06,413.16
     That's a different story,
},
{
    413.68,416.64
     but it doesn't seem like there's any large arthritic findings in there.
},
{
    416.66,419.08
     There's nothing we need to do surgically to this hip.
},
{
    420.04,423.52
     And lastly, as we see, if this is a positive,
},
{
    423.64,425.68
     this is called the, uh, for bears test. Now usually we'll look at the other side to see if this is a positive, this is called the the, uh, for bears test.
},
{
    426.6,428.64
     Now, usually we'll look at the other side to see if there's
},
{
    428.68,430.32
     asymmetries with range of motion.
},
{
    431.28,432.32
     I don't know what we're going to find on her.
},
{
    432.32,436.04
     I'll stay over here just because the camera angle, but this
},
{
    436.04,437.2
     side feel a little tighter for you.
},
{
    437.24,437.96
     Or is that your phone?
},
{
    439.8,440.16
     Okay.
},
{
    440.6,446.36
     And so going outwards here, I'm looking at generally knee to foot position here.
},
{
    446.36,450.76
     Roughly, let's just say that's one hour for doing a clock, a big clock.
},
{
    450.76,452.6
     I don't know what this one will do.
},
{
    452.6,456.4
     This one's like two hours, three hours.
},
{
    456.4,459.2
     So a lot more range on this side.
},
{
    459.2,462.2
     And in the squatting pattern, you didn't put weight on this side.
},
{
    462.2,464.2
     So this side's getting a little extra work.
},
{
    464.2,469.12
     Okay. We do all the same tests on the other side of the body and go ahead and we're
},
{
    469.12,473.6
     going to do one last one as a test to see if this is maybe from the back. Go ahead and
},
{
    473.6,481.6
     go see it for me. These tests are a little bit more out of order. If we were in a real
},
{
    481.6,486.84
     setting here we'd screen the spine out first. Do you need images to do the spine?
},
{
    486.84,488.24
     No, you don't.
},
{
    488.24,491.68
     You don't need an image to confirm if you have a disc herniation or a pinch nerve or
},
{
    491.68,492.68
     any of that stuff.
},
{
    492.68,493.92
     It's extra information.
},
{
    493.92,495.04
     It's not bad.
},
{
    495.04,496.4
     It's not needed though.
},
{
    496.4,499.12
     In most cases, we can do it all like this.
},
{
    499.12,501.64
     The next thing we're going to have Mary Lou do is just scoot you back a little bit for
},
{
    501.64,503.68
     me.
},
{
    503.68,505.74
     Can you go ahead and get real depressed?
},
{
    506.24,511.96
     Head down even. There you go. Some people this will actually create their groin pain.
},
{
    511.96,519.32
     And so there's nothing really changing much of the hip. In fact, the hip itself will actually open up range here
},
{
    519.32,524.0
     because she's in a posterior tilt. The ab wall, do you feel like your abs are working at all?
},
{
    524.32,527.2
     They're not doing anything, right? They're not stretching because she's not
},
{
    527.2,531.4
     extending. They're not contracting hard because she's not really throwing
},
{
    531.4,535.2
     anything or running. But this stresses another part of the body which is the
},
{
    535.2,540.16
     backside of the spine and this would be more confirming of maybe a disc. Okay? And
},
{
    540.16,543.6
     so this one's an interesting one and you can actually double down on it. Go ahead
},
{
    543.6,545.0
     and grab the edges of the table.
},
{
    545.0,547.6
     Don't move your body and go ahead and pull the seat.
},
{
    547.6,549.6
     There you go right there and just relax.
},
{
    549.6,550.6
     Good.
},
{
    550.6,552.8
     So if that increases it, this is a further confirmation.
},
{
    552.8,554.0
     We're looking at low back disc.
},
{
    554.0,561.6
     Again, easy to address, but it's really commonly associated with sports hernia presentation
},
{
    561.6,562.8
     or groin pain.
},
{
    562.8,564.4
     How does it refer to there?
},
{
    564.4,568.32
     You got to trust me on this because this is probably a way of a whole nother video on our channel on this specifically
},
{
    568.32,571.72
     But I won't spend time on it doing this today. Here's the last test go ahead and stand
},
{
    573.08,575.08
     This test turned towards me
},
{
    575.4,577.0
     just knee up
},
{
    577.0,581.2
     And just stay a lot of times people will have pain with this and they'll have the
},
{
    581.56,585.56
     Duplication of the groin issues that they came in for.
},
{
    585.56,587.6
     This can irritate a spore, turnia, FAI,
