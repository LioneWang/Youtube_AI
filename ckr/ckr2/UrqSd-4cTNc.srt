     the thumbs at the base of your skull. You'll find two small bony bumps, one on each side,

    31.64,37.2
     left and right. Move right beneath those bony bumps to find an area that is soft and perhaps

     a little tender. You can use your other fingers to massage your skull while you are also massaging below these bony areas. Massage in small circular

     And same thing on the other side.
