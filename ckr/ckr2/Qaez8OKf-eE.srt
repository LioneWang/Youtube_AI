     Hello, my name is Joaquin Sanchez and I am one of the Solder Resolutions at Mayo Clinic.
},
{
    6.4,14.4
     Today, I would like to talk to you about rotator cafters, one of the most common reasons for shoulder pain.
},
{
    14.4,25.72
     The rotator calf is a group of muscles and tendons essential for the coordination and power of the shoulder joint. Problems occur when part of a rotator calf becomes
},
{
    25.72,31.88
     irritated or damaged as a result of injury, overuse or simply wear and tear
},
{
    31.88,38.52
     over time. This can result in pain, weakness and reduced range of motion.
},
{
    38.52,43.48
     Thirst affecting the full thickness of the rotator calf are typically visible on
},
{
    43.48,46.36
     an MRI. If you are suffering with the symptoms of a rotator cuff are typically visible on an MRI.
},
{
    46.36,50.36
     If you are suffering with the symptoms of a rotator cuff, discussing your options with
},
{
    50.36,53.26
     a shoulder surgeon is recommended.
},
{
    53.26,59.0
     In some circumstances, waiting too long can lead to muscle retraction and weakening beyond
},
{
    59.0,60.0
     repair.
},
{
    60.0,64.04
     The good news is that some individuals with a rotator cuff tear can feel improvements
},
{
    64.04,68.0
     in pain, motion and strength without surgery.
},
{
    69.0,75.0
     One corticosteroid injection can serve as a jump start by alleviating inflammation.
},
{
    76.0,81.0
     However, too many steroid injections must be avoided, since they weaken the tendon and bone structure,
},
{
    82.0,86.92
     increasing the chances of failure if surgery becomes necessary.
},
{
    86.92,92.2
     A physical therapy program focused on calf strengthening has the highest chance of success.
},
{
    92.2,97.76
     If you want to remember one exercise to keep your rotator calf healthy, elastic band strengthening
},
{
    97.76,102.08
     in internal and external rotation will help you the most.
},
{
    102.08,109.42
     Hold a towel or magazine under your armpit to block dealt with contraction. Then use elastic bands to strengthen the calf muscles,
},
{
    109.42,116.66
     pulling inwards for a few sets, then outwards using a door knob. Many individuals
},
{
    116.66,121.5
     cannot overcome the symptoms of a torn rotator calf and end up needing surgery.
},
{
    121.5,127.5
     The most common procedure consists of using a thread-like material called suture
},
{
    127.5,130.0
     to repair the rotator cuff to bone.
},
{
    130.0,136.0
     Rotator cuff repair can be performed arthroscopically through small puncture wounds.
},
{
    136.0,141.0
     Arthroscopic cuff repair has emerged as a major advance in shoulder surgery.
},
{
    141.0,145.46
     It is accurate, minimally invasive, much less painful and
},
{
    145.46,150.24
     cosmetically appealing. A camera is introduced through a puncture wound to
},
{
    150.24,154.68
     visualize during surgery. The repair is performed by placing anchors in the bone,
},
{
    154.68,159.58
     passing switches to the tendon and securing the switches to the bone.
},
{
    159.58,163.82
     Incention of the camera through a small puncture wound allows excellent
},
{
    163.82,169.5
     visualization. Instruments are used to pass switchers from the bone anchors through the tendon.
},
{
    169.5,174.9
     The repair is completed by further securing the switchers and tendon to bone.
},
{
    174.9,180.9
     The completed repair is shown to demonstrate secure fixation of the torn tendons to bone.
},
{
    180.9,186.66
     Most patients do not need to stay in the hospital after surgery. Protecting
},
{
    186.66,192.2
     the repair for a few weeks after surgery by use of a shoulder sling facilitates healing.
},
{
    192.2,197.72
     Several amounts of therapy are required to completely restore motion, strength and function.
},
{
    197.72,203.84
     Many patients feel the shoulder function is restored to normal. Unfortunately, in some
},
{
    203.84,206.6
     patients the extent of tendon damage is such that
},
{
    206.6,211.36
     tendon repair is no longer an option. At Mayo Clinic, two other surgical solutions
},
{
    211.36,216.16
     are considered in these circumstances. If the joint itself is not severely
},
{
    216.16,220.84
     damaged, tendon transfers can be very successful. One or more tendons are
},
{
    220.84,226.68
     surgically moved to the areas of rhodiotorcaf damage and compensate for their function.
},
{
    226.68,231.08
     There are multiple tendon transfers that can be considered and it is important to select
},
{
    231.08,234.88
     the transfer that is best for each patient.
},
{
    234.88,238.76
     Long-standing rhodiotorcafters will eventually lead to arthritis.
},
{
    238.76,243.96
     Reverse joint replacement is the best solution for this combination of arthritis and a damaged
},
{
    243.96,245.84
     rhodiotorcaf. the best solution for this combination of arthritis and a damaged rotator cuff.
},
{
    245.84,250.64
     In a reversed joint replacement, the ball and socket structure is reversed.
},
{
    250.64,256.7
     An artificial hemisphere is fixed to the socket and an artificial stem with a concave opening
},
{
    256.7,259.48
     is placed inside the bone in the arm.
},
{
    259.48,265.0
     This change in geometry empowers the deltoid muscle and compensates for the rotator cuff.
},
{
    265.0,269.52
     Recovery is actually very fast with only two or three weeks of immobilization.
},
{
    269.52,273.64
     Remember to have your rotator cuff checked by a solder surgeon if you experience sudden
},
{
    273.64,278.32
     loss of solder motion after an injury, or if you have been experiencing dull ache for
},
{
    278.32,279.32
     months.
},
{
    279.32,283.28
     If your cuff is found to be torn, you may be recommended to consider one injection on
},
{
    283.28,289.88
     physical therapy, or you may be best to proceed with arthroscopic calf repair right away.
},
{
    289.88,294.8
     If the amount of tendon damage is beyond repair, tendon transfers and reverse arthroplasty
},
{
    294.8,297.4
     are successful solutions for many patients.
},
{
    297.4,301.36
     As you can see, there are many surgical solutions for calf tears who will help you select the
},
{
    301.36,303.52
     one that is best for you.
