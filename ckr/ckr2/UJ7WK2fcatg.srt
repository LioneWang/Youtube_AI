     Welcome back guys, I'm Nick from Active Chiropractic and I'm going to show you how to do some stretches
},
{
    7.88,9.88
     for the rotator cuff muscles.
},
{
    9.88,13.16
     So there's two movements that are mainly in the rotator cuff muscles, that's internal
},
{
    13.16,15.28
     rotation and external rotation.
},
{
    15.28,20.14
     Now it's very important to do these stretches because we need the flexibility and the mobility
},
{
    20.14,24.64
     in our shoulders and definitely it will also prevent injury as well.
},
{
    24.64,27.92
     Now if you're an athlete and you're doing weight lifting or power lifting
},
{
    28.44,30.16
     having overhead movements
},
{
    30.16,37.84
     it's quite detrimental on the shoulder if you don't have the flexibility or the mobility for it and you can't perform the movements properly.
},
{
    38.2,42.02
     Now obviously if you do this these stretches and have the flexibility and mobility
},
{
    42.52,44.4
     regained you definitely
},
{
    44.4,45.52
     reduce the chances
},
{
    45.52,47.02
     of injury.
},
{
    47.02,51.6
     For myself, I noticed if I do squats and if I don't have the flexibility to have the
},
{
    51.6,56.84
     bar on my shoulders and I put it over like so, I notice that it's quite painful.
},
{
    56.84,59.48
     So these stretches definitely helped me out.
},
{
    59.48,67.64
     And thirdly, if you do have posture problems and you're hunched over like so, these rotator cuffs normally
},
{
    67.64,72.32
     compensate for that posture problem, this posture compensation.
},
{
    72.32,78.1
     So the muscles spasm and you also feel referred pain into the shoulder.
},
{
    78.1,81.72
     So it's very important to do these stretches and it will definitely reduce the pain in
},
{
    81.72,83.4
     the shoulders as well.
},
{
    83.4,88.32
     Now most importantly, if you do have problems with your shoulders, it's best to see a chiropractor
},
{
    88.32,93.22
     or physician and get it assessed properly and get prescribed the proper rehab exercises
},
{
    93.22,94.96
     and conditioning for yourself.
},
{
    94.96,98.96
     Alright guys, for the first stretch for the external rotators, just get a broomstick or
},
{
    98.96,103.96
     a pole, put it behind your back like so, and then put your hand behind your back, grab it
},
{
    103.96,109.6
     on the back, and then bring it over one of your shoulders and hold it for about 30 seconds to a minute.
},
{
    110.96,116.16
     Okay now you might feel like it's wrenching your shoulders and you feel the stretch in your
},
{
    116.16,121.04
     anterior deltoids which is here but it also stretches your external rotators as well
},
{
    122.32,126.8
     which is your infraspinatus and your supraspinatus.
},
{
    126.8,130.14
     You pull it up so be sure to change the position of the pole onto the other
},
{
    130.14,135.96
     shoulder and pull up like so and you hold that for about 20 to 30 seconds and
},
{
    135.96,140.24
     relax. I want you to do about three to four sets of this. Now you can also do
},
{
    140.24,143.4
     it with the towel as well but you don't have the pole to actually create that
},
{
    143.4,148.96
     leverage so what you do is you scrap the towel, bring it over your head like so and then pull the towel
},
{
    148.96,154.64
     upwards like so and you stretch it and pull it over your shoulder and then to the other shoulder
},
{
    156.64,162.32
     and you hold that for about 30 to a minute. So for the internal rotator stretches what I want you
},
{
    162.32,165.16
     to do is get a pole next to you,
},
{
    165.16,170.4
     put your hand up like you're saying stop, grab it like so, thread the pole underneath,
},
{
    170.4,174.08
     grab the pole underneath like so, and wrench it forward.
},
{
    174.08,178.48
     And this, and grab the pole, and it will pull your forearm backwards, and that will stretch
},
{
    178.48,180.24
     the internal rotators.
},
{
    180.24,186.24
     And you'll hold this for about 30 seconds to a minute, and you do it three to four sets, so three to four times.
},
{
    188.0,195.52
     Now if any of these stretches do cause you pain, just stop immediately and ask a physician, ask your chiropractor and say
},
{
    195.52,201.36
     why do these movements hurt for you? And we'll get it assessed and give you proper exercises.
},
{
    201.36,205.24
     I mean you might have other issues that's going in your neck or in your
},
{
    205.24,210.04
     shoulder so it's best to stop the exercises if they're causing you pain.
},
{
    210.04,214.24
