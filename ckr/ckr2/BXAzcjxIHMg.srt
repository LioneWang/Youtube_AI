     Hey everybody, it's Doctor Jo and sleepy Cali and today I'm going to show you my top 10 stretches and exercises
},
{
    6.8,9.36
     For tennis elbow. So let's get started
},
{
    9.8,11.8
     Just claim her word
},
{
    15.28,20.36
     Look at that. Look at that Miss Cali, it's you. So before we get started
},
{
    20.36,28.64
     I just wanted to show that sometimes one of the coolest things about the YouTube channel is viewers like you send me some really neat stuff.
},
{
    28.64,28.92
     And so Yop
},
{
    28.92,36.48
     and so Yopalimstra all the way from Holland sent me some puppy portraits and as you can see it's just as cute
},
{
    36.48,37.48
     as Miss Callie.
},
{
    37.48,38.48
     Thank you so much.
},
{
    38.48,39.48
     Let's get going.
},
{
    39.48,45.44
     The first treatment is going to be soft tissue mobilization on the
},
{
    45.44,49.84
     outside or lateral side where that tennis elbow is. So make sure that you're
},
{
    49.84,55.44
     mobilizing it and not just rubbing it. For soft tissue mobilization for tennis
},
{
    55.44,61.08
     elbow or lateral epicondylitis, you want to find the outside of your elbow where
},
{
    61.08,70.12
     all those muscles come in and attach and you're actually mobilizing the tissue. You're not rubbing it, but you're actually moving the tissue around. You can
},
{
    70.12,76.68
     go in circles, you can go side to side like a cross friction massage, or you can go up
},
{
    76.68,88.32
     and down. Just move your way through the area where the tender spots are.
},
{
    94.28,97.36
     So number two is a wrist extensor stretch with elbow extension. So just make sure that you hear that I'm saying extensor or you're stretching your
},
{
    97.36,102.48
     extensors. You're not stretching extension. For wrist extensor stretch with
},
{
    102.48,107.0
     your elbow extended, put your arms straight out and make a fist with your hand.
},
{
    107.0,111.0
     Then with the other hand, help push it down and hold that stretch.
},
{
    122.0,127.0
     Number three is wrist flexor stretch with elbow extension. So again I'm saying flexor,
},
{
    128.0,132.0
     not flexion. So then you're just stretching the other side. Even though those muscles
},
{
    132.0,136.0
     are on the inside for something like a golfer's elbow, you really want to stretch the whole
},
{
    136.0,141.0
     area to make sure it's loose and has increased circulation. For wrist flexor stretch with
},
{
    142.0,147.0
     your elbow extended, put your arms straight out and then bring your fingers up.
},
{
    147.0,151.0
     Stretch with the other hand and hold.
},
{
    168.52,172.08
     So number four is wrist extension with elbow flexion. So this is just more an active range of motion. You're just getting everything moving at the wrist
},
{
    172.08,177.08
     and getting that increased circulation to the area. For wrist extension with
},
{
    177.08,181.6
     elbow flexion, bend your elbow and place your arm on a table with your wrist
},
{
    181.6,191.2
     just off the table so you have some movement. Make a fist with your hand and then bring it up and slowly come back down.
},
{
    199.36,204.12
     Number five is wrist extension with a weight. So now you're starting to strengthen
},
{
    204.12,205.04
     the area a little bit.
},
{
    205.04,208.64
     You can just start off with a small one to two pound weight
},
{
    208.64,211.64
     or a soup or vegetable can.
},
{
    211.64,213.32
     For wrist extension with a weight,
},
{
    213.32,215.6
     you can use a soup or vegetable can.
},
{
    216.44,221.16
     Put your palm down and go down and then bring it up
},
{
    221.16,235.56
     as far as you comfortably can.
},
{
    239.9,241.86
     Number six is radial and ulnar deviation range of motion. So again, now you're just kind of going in
},
{
    241.86,243.54
     a different direction, but you want to get
},
{
    243.54,247.0
     that range of motion all around that elbow.
},
{
    247.0,251.6
     For ulnar and radial deviation with elbow flexion, bend your elbow and place it on a
},
{
    251.6,252.6
     table.
},
{
    252.6,255.76
     Put your wrist just off the table so you have some movement.
},
{
    255.76,272.2
     Make a fist with your hand and just turn it out and in. Number seven is radial deviation with a weight.
},
{
    272.2,274.6
     So again, now you're kind of strengthening the area.
},
{
    274.6,278.4
     You just want to make sure that all those muscles are getting some muscle retraining
},
{
    278.4,281.08
     and increasing blood flow to the area.
},
{
    281.08,285.88
     For radial deviation with a weight, you can use a super vegetable can. Put
},
{
    285.88,292.56
     your thumb up on top and go down and up.
},
{
    303.68,307.28
     Number eight is wrist supination and pronation.
},
{
    307.28,311.76
     So now this motion is more at the elbow, so sometimes it's a little more uncomfortable,
},
{
    311.76,314.6
     so just go in your pain-free motion.
},
{
    314.6,320.56
     For wrist pronation and supination, put your elbow by your side, put your fingers out,
},
{
    320.56,326.72
     and then just turn your wrist into supination and then back to pronation.
},
{
    333.8,338.72
     Number nine is wrist supination and pronation with a weight. I like to use a
},
{
    338.72,342.14
     hammer. You just want something that's a little top-heavy. If you don't have
},
{
    342.14,347.68
     anything like that, some people might want to use a water bottle or something like that. But again this is a little bit
},
{
    347.68,352.54
     more of a awkward type motion so start off really light and just go through that
},
{
    352.54,357.6
     pain-free motion with that weight. For wrist pronation and supination with the
},
{
    357.6,361.52
     weight you can use a hammer because it'll give you an extra stretch. Bend your
},
{
    361.52,365.28
     elbow by your side and then take the hammer and go out into
},
{
    365.28,370.44
     supination and then back in to pronation.
},
{
    379.8,387.48
     Number 10 is towel twist with wrist extension. So this is almost like you're revving a motorcycle.
},
{
    387.48,393.34
     You're trying to get that motion. So using a towel starts getting you some resistance, but it's not a strong resistance.
},
{
    393.34,397.34
     So it's kind of a nice place to start getting that strengthening and that muscle retraining.
},
{
    397.76,401.58
     For towel twist with wrist extension, roll up a towel,
},
{
    402.92,408.88
     turn your hand this way and twist it back into extension.
},
{
    412.6,419.08
     Isn't that beautiful Miss Cooley? So there you have it. I know it's so cute
},
