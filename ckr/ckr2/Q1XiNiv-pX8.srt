     our environment. Any sort of trauma to the hand can disrupt these coordinated motions,

    42.2,47.04
     Because the fingers are used for many daily activities, they are at higher risk

     Broken fingers account for up to 10% of all broken bones. It can be hard sometimes to

     tell if a finger is broken, sprained, or dislocated. So any suspicious injury to the fingers should be evaluated by a physician.

     Common causes include osteoporosis, tumors, and infection.

},
{
    161.0,165.48
     Treatment options depend on the type of fracture and the individual bones

     or bone in the fingers that are broken. If the fracture is stable, treatment may be

    171.64,177.4
     as simple as splinting one finger to another by taping them together. The splint is left
},

    177.4,182.2
     in place for about four weeks, followed by an additional two weeks of limiting finger

    182.2,189.0
     use. If the fracture is unstable, the injured finger will need to be immobilized.
},
{
    189.0,194.0
     The simplest way is to apply a splint after realigning the fractured fragments.
},
{
    194.0,199.0
     If this does not help with stability, a surgical procedure may be needed.
},
{
    199.0,204.0
     Surgical immobilization ranges from pinning the fractures with small wires
},
{
    204.0,205.72
     to open procedures with plate

     On your way to the hospital or clinic, you can do the following to help your finger.
},
{
    215.08,220.44
     Apply ice wrapped in a cloth to the injured finger to help reduce swelling and pain.
},
{
    220.44,224.16
     Do not apply ice directly to the skin.
},
{
    224.16,227.0
     Remove all jewelry or rings from the affected finger.
},
{
    228.0,232.5
     Make a temporary splint by putting a pen or lollipop stick next to the finger
},
{
    232.5,236.5
     and wrapping something around the stick and finger to hold it in place.
