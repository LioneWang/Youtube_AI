{
    0.0,5.98
     Alright, now let's cover infant rescue breathing.
},
{
    5.98,10.9
     This is going to be used when you have a baby who is not breathing or not breathing normally,
},
{
    10.9,13.24
     but they do have a brachial pulse.
},
{
    13.24,16.28
     Now, in this scenario, we've assessed the scene.
},
{
    16.28,17.28
     The scene is safe.
},
{
    17.28,18.28
     Our gloves are on.
},
{
    18.28,19.68
     Our CPR shield is available.
},
{
    19.68,22.4
     We check to see if the baby is responsive.
},
{
    22.4,23.4
     They're not responsive.
},
{
    23.4,25.0
     We can see that they're not breathing.
},
{
    25.0,28.84
     We activate the emergency medical services or call a code.
},
{
    28.84,32.32
     We check a break-yell pulse for no more than 10 seconds.
},
{
    32.32,36.2
     I do feel a pulse easily in the break-yell artery
},
{
    36.2,39.96
     but the baby's still not breathing. So I'm going to begin rescue breathing.
},
{
    39.96,43.28
     I'm going to cover the mouth and the nose of the baby
},
{
    43.28,50.54
     with a mask, sealing all the way around, tilting the head back into a neutral position, giving one breath every three seconds
},
{
    50.54,53.54
     for about two minutes.
},
{
    53.54,60.54
     Checking for chest rise and fall, and readjusting the head until you get good air into the lungs,
},
{
    60.54,63.4
     getting a good chest rise and fall.
},
{
    63.4,66.86
     After two minutes, I'm going to reassess the brachial artery.
},
{
    66.86,70.74
     If I do not feel a pulse, I'm going to move right into CPR.
},
{
    70.74,75.18
     If I feel a pulse but there's still no breathing, continue rescue breathing one breath every
},
{
    75.18,77.46
     three seconds for two minutes.
},
{
    77.46,79.82
     After two minutes, reassess the pulse.
},
{
    79.82,87.0
     We're only going to stop rescue breathing and checking pulses when an AED arrives and we hook them up to the AED
},
{
    87.0,91.16
     when they're pulse-less and or when EMS
},
{
    91.16,93.16
     or the next level of care arrives.
},
{
    93.16,96.84
     Baby, baby, are you all right?
},
{
    96.84,97.68
     Are you okay?
},
{
    97.68,98.96
     There's no response.
},
{
    98.96,100.68
     They don't appear to be breathing.
},
{
    100.68,102.56
     Go activate the emergency medical services
},
{
    102.56,104.46
     or call 911 or call a code.
},
{
    107.0,140.28
     Checking to break your pulse. Yep, minutes, then check a pulse.
},
{
    140.28,145.6
     If the pulse is still present, but the baby's not breathing, I'll continue rescue breathing
},
{
    145.6,148.34
     one breath every three seconds for another two minutes.
},
{
    148.34,153.76
     If the pulse is gone and the baby's not breathing, I'm going to start CPR.
},
{
    153.76,159.44
     I'll do this until an AED arrives in the pulseless baby or until emergency medical services arrive
},
{
    159.44,160.0
     and takes over.
},
